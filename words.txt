you believe in In a dreary world something as ridiculous as this is extremely welcome I cannot stop myself from laughing Everybody gangsta till the shark is your strategist This is one of those images that gets better the longer you look at it Why would it be Ben The sharkguard is the most effective branch of military How long do you think it will be before people dont even know why the costume says left shark and not just Shark So I recently read that since theres no way to reach the zipper on the back by yourself and that the flippers are useless he better hope he didnt drink a lot of coffee or needs to do anything important without bothering someone every  seconds so this is the secret weapon the US military was working on Sharky and palp If sharky here then where is palpatine This man is lifting morale Gotta love it especially during the holidays Ben Its Ben Is this the origin story to shark guard The man works at Ft Bliss and El Pasos hospitals are maxed out with CovidIm glad he gets to have some respite Bennnnnnnn If there is anything I know about the Sharkguard its that everyone in this picture is dead soon Shouldve joined the Palppatrol its safer I fear your buddy isnt going to make it through drills Left shark isnt known for sticking to the formation Ben Never invite a shark to a seal meeting Sharkira is back Yes So sad that he is the only person that showed up to work  Just because you can doesnt me you should But Im glad he did I think thats my favorite costume yet it looks so hilariously out of place Were going to need a bigger upvote In these difficult times the Yogscast is forced to expand into the private military sector Please tell me what rank your buddy is This is too good Is this a military base or did everyone wear costumes and no one coordinated with home dude Sharky and Palp Why did all the other guys wear the same costume This is fn amazing What is that shark doing in a empty conference room This image has dramatically improved my day A Gawr Gura Classic Ben play Every girl crazy bout a shark dressed man Gotta love that even the Army acknowledges the superiority of the Navy by naming its first armored division after a ship This is just a friendly branch rivalry joke to let all the keyboard generals out there know b they roast me even though they wont read this part and still roast me Also props to this command for authorizing costumes at work God its awkward enough when one person shows up with the same costume as you Now imagine  See you guys are dumb because theyre gonna be looking for army guys Which one of you jokers invited the navy guy to the briefing Why is he alone in the room Plot twist Its the Brigade Commander What fucking show was it that the Lawyer dressed up for Halloween in his Law Office and found out that the only other person dressed up was the office dipshit and they freaked out and it was a whole disaster trying to get him professional clothes This reminds me of that lol Babyyyy shark tun tun tun tun tun tun That shark isnt wearing a mask I guess it must be a Great Frightto everyone in the room Holy shit Thats a lot of sharks in exactly the same costume Dont they have any imagination Sir Im telling you there is so much oil under the ocean just waiting for some freedom Move over navy seals theres a new game in town A true champion of the people Fort Bliss Despite the name that place is not blissful Okay this is great and super wholesome and all but Im really appreciating the fact that camo facemasks are a thing Are those standard issue Be careful Bens a traitor I didnt know Bedgar was in the military ryogscast bens ttt training Must be a nd Lt Ill bet those other guys were pissed when everyone showed up in the same soldier costume And they just left him alone in the room because of that Party poopers That one shark probably feels stupid he didnt dress up Wait were assuming thats the army what if theyre just military enthusiasts cosplaying and thats like Regional offices of burgerking That would be my fav person in that room As a vet I love this One of these things is not like the otherI wonder if shehe knew hedshed be the only one I like to think thats the case SHARKY AND PALP You guys are idiots Theyll be looking for Army Uniform Soldiers Why is a shark sitting in an empty room by itself Weve all known that guy or gal The world is a little more special with then in it I want more input from left shark on this next mission You know all those serious military guys are just cheesing under their masks Why did all the other guys wear the same costume I was looking for a sign to join the military Army shark Doo doo doo Thats Fuckn hilarious Flex A weapon to surpass Metal Gear Iron soldiers Old Ironsides We serve with honor we serve with pride Wow This made me so happy I actually laughed out loud Thank you for posting this lmao Rlly sad that no one else was in the room to see his costume  That looks like the st brigade conference rooms on Far East Bliss I love how no ones fucks are triggered about this situation Surely you cant be that damn professional military personnel Gotta give credits too the army people being serious in there For sure leaving that room they gonna be laughing hard as hell Its pretty obvious who got left out of the office memo that everyone was wearing matching costumes Left shark is still a legend even today Not the hero we deserved but the hero we needed I wore a dress once when I was in the Army We also did a huge battalion run while I was wearing that dress It sucked When you unlock your favorite skin in a game Hit theee deck do do do do I really needed that laugh Get this man a promotion There is no way in hell you were allowed to take this picture andor post it online but I love you for it Fucking legend I like how almost everyone decided to dress as an army guy He dressed up as a second lieutenant Look all Im saying is no one will be looking for a shark in the desert Goddammit didnt you get the memo that were all planning on going as Army guys Now we all just look stupid Respect to the shark for showing up and staying at the party alone Army shark dodododo Sucks no one else came to the meeting tho Why he is alone in this room Omg Im in love Army SHARK doo doo da doot doo doo When you wanna be a marine but end up being a soldier Kind of strange they allow pictures let alone a posted picture Why is there a shark alone in a conference room Is he early to the meeting Hahahaha love it By far the dude in the shark suit is the biggest badass in the room I know its a shark but I wanna say his costume is a navy blue seal This looks like something youd get fired for I see only one person not dressed up for Halloween at shark school Must be lonely in that big confrence room with no one to keep him company I bet he is stil in camo underneath I just cannot imagine otherwise wow he is the only one who didnt decide to dress up like a soldier All the rest had the same idea throw a hepa filter on the fan and hes a covid proof shark Sergeant Left Shark reporting for duty Credit to ueneeidiot for this platinumed septuple gilded and octuple silvered

grandfatherhttpswwwredditcomrinterestingasfuckcommentsbliuthesejewishmenarrivedinauschwitzontheempufl Per ujgrin over herehttpswwwredditcomrinterestingasfuckcommentsbliuthesejewishmenarrivedinauschwitzontheempow  The guy in the middle has spoken at my schools for the last  years Hes  now but has travelled all over the world to tell his story He was separated from his family at  and sent to various concentration camps He was one of the Birkenau Boys that were spared by Dr Mengele to serve as laborers He lost a toe in those camps Eventually he came to to US where he met his wife who was saved Kindertransport Hes also really funny and likes to do magic tricks because his bunkmate at one of the camps taught him some Very inspirational story Herehttpstwittercomsandibachomstatus is the source of this image Per there  sandibachom  Werner and Walter were  when they were separated from their parents and put in Auschwitz They were tattooed  numbers apart ALL Holocaust survivors I interview still weep when they talk about the moment they were taken from parents   AM  Jun   Look at their beautiful faces reminding us to never forget the atrocities done to them and their loved ones This honestly is what pisses me off more than anything when people compare something like wearing mask for Covid to the Holocaust No one is abducting you No one is forcibly branding you No one is gassing your family in front of you Theyre just asking you to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth for  minutes Fuck you Hitler Edit Since this has exploded Ill ask that in lieu of any further awards yall do what it takes to vote or help those who need help to vote Even if youre not  you can help by volunteering at polling places Do your part to make sure America is represented well on Tuesday Edit thank you all for the awards The multiple Wholesome awards are particularly neat Fun fact a lot of the degenerate vermin that tattooed these men had to get their own SS tattoos that were later instrumental in finding and prosecuting them after the war Some would resort to mutilating themselves to remove their tattoo The US army then distributed pamphlets on how to spot scars from removing their tattoo Im hopeful that these three men ended up living a much longer and more fulfilling life than the scum that tattooed them True survivors men we should honor and celebrate They survived literal hell May they live long healthy lives May they spread awareness May we never forget and above all never repeat the past Imagine how those men must feel nowadays with the rise of mass ignorance and people who deny that it ever happened to them Its like can you not see that I bear a physical reminder of their cruelty on my body Fuck Holocaust deniers These people who suffered are real and what was done to them was horrific Id be interested to know how they feel about those numbers and if any ever sought some sort of tattoo removal In a talk with Bachom Reich and Spier who are now  years old they detailed their separate horrible experiences in the three concentration camps of Auschwitz including the death march Teary eyed they recalled how they were separated from their families as young teens after arriving at the camps and realizing that they could no longer see them ever again facing the brutality and inhumane acts of the Nazi soldiers In the celebration of International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the th anniversary of the liberation of AuschwitzBirkenau concentration camp this month Reich and Spier together with their families and friends remember this episode of their life and recognize the lessons it left for the coming generations to learn and accept These men were reunited through the help of The Last Eyewitness Project httpslasteyewitnessningcom Damn Thats where my grandfathers uncle and his family died I wonder if they met him at some point As someone who was abandoned as a child and taken in by Neo Nazis who tried to make me hate the Jews Muslims and Blacks Im sorry My words might not mean much but these vile pricks target people who are mentally weak or lonely they promise to be your friends when really theyre using you to spread hate Never have I felt the weight of a place consume me more than I did when at the Dachau concentration camp Its impossible the put in to words the pain that lingers in the entire place If anyone has an opportunity to go to an old concentration camp I would highly encourage it Quite a unique life experience Always remember to shut down those who say this never happened Unbelievably dense How many Holocaust survivors are left even if you were born in a camp in  before the end of the way that would still make you like  today at the youngest There cant be many left I imagine As an Israeli Jew I remember that when I was younger the school used to bring Holocaust survivors in on the Holocaust day th of April to tell their story the last few years its been their sons and daughters telling their parents storys The fact that my kids will never meet a Holocaust survivor and that in just a few more years there will be non left truly and deeply hurts me We shall never forget Ive been to Dachau Auschwitz and Birkenau I just dont understand how we literally have peoples remains behind glass yet some people believe the whole thing was a hoax It wasnt Stop watching sketchy youtube Edit freaking auto correct It still blows my mind that people think the holocaust was fake Fuckin badasses This picture is awesome and shows three strong motherfuckers Let us never forget the atrocities of the past so we never allow them to be repeated I feel like they should get to punch any holocaust denier when ever they want And Twitter allows Khomeni to say the Holocaust did not happenI worked with a russian fellow that survivedthat fucking tattoo said all I needed to knowhe had some stories that would make you cry IMO it should read Jewish boys or children to drive home the atrocities  years later and they look to be in their mid eighties which puts them around  years old at the time Absolutely horrible Nice try nazis obviously not a nice try Fuck all nazis   May their memories be a blessing I was a Paramedic for  years Had the honor of transporting several holocaust survivors One day we are giving Old Fella a ride back to the nursing home Im chatting with him and hes in good spirits so we are yucking it up In my rig it was always amateur comedy hour Then I spot his digits while checking his blood pressure I got a little quiet Old Fella saw me checking out his ink and I swear to God he said Worst summer camp ever I was speechless You win I said I got to know him a little before I transferred One of my favorites Incurable joker till the end God love ya Milk Man They tried to bury us They didnt know that we were seeds It gives me chills to see pictures like this A testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity May each of us do our part to rid cruelty and hatred of this kind from the earth Its certainly still here The German people just sat and by and did nothing as their Jewish neighbors were forcibly removed from their homes and I sat by and did nothing when little kids were separated from their parents and put into cages at the border You know I know the gentleman on the far left met him in a school field trip once His stories were surreal Its amazing to see how happy and strong he is though Truly extraordinary I had an unbelievable experience a few years ago Im a nurse and while working overnight I took a patient down for a test They were having problems with the patient who was before her so we wound up sitting in the waiting bay Turns out she was a holocaust survivor and I got to have a on conversation with her that lasted over an hour She told me her story and then encouraged me to pick her brain about her experience It was a very emotional and raw experience It was so much more personal than any other story Ive heard because she was talking only to me and answering all my questions Ive met and spoken with other survivors but never like this I will never forget and will retell her story for years so that we dont forget My children and grandchildren will know her story While its understandable to forgive regular soldiers in the Wehrmacht caught up in the nationalism of the era I fully support Israeli efforts to locate extradite try and sentence or flat out assassinate any and all remaining death camp officers and guards Fuck those people Im not even Israeli or Jewish You go Mossad I will always upvote this image Reposts be damned bUt hiTLeR DiD nOtHiNg wRoNg  Proud Boys and Klansmen You cant impress these guys with your badass hardcore tattoo They got theirs the hardest way possible THIS is why you fight fascism Because if it depends on the clown in the Oval Office this is what would happen to a lot more people Taking place in China right now Your shoes and phones are made by slave labor This just makes me hate holocaust deniers way way more Thank god these men survived what a horrible situation to be in Never forget Never give in Some of my hardest days I wanted to curl up and disappear Dont know how the fuck these paragons of resilience managed My father inlaw was so lucky he survived here in Poland he is  years old still strong Idk why but I tend to rarely upvote things but this I upvoted This is awesome Two of the most remarkable quotes I have ever heard Auschwitz was nothing Auschwitz was a holiday camp Hershl Sperling comparing Auschwitz to Treblinka He survived both camps So glad they survived Fuck Holocaust Deniers Especially Toothbrush This makes me happy and sad and angry I am so glad they can smile despite all the pain they went through I mean if I even felt a fraction of what they felt I would of ended it and Im sad that they have to go through So much this angry that that this happened to anyone I hope they are well especially during these times Never Again There used to be a lady on my subway for years wore sleeveless dresses and she had a number on her arm like this with a circle arround it Shitte was dramatic to see that Its infuriating that there is a non zero chance that there are people that think the Holocost didnt happen Very similar events are happening to Muslims in China but it never gets talked about Fuck Hitler and fuck Xi Jinping They survived Their torturers are dead Still boggles my mind that the Holocaust wasnt that long ago Ive learned about it in school so much but I feel like I still dont really know that much about it But yeait never happened right s What a powerful image We survived I dont know how these  fine gentleman have made it to this day The way society has molded us I dont think any of us could have the mental capacity to deal with the things they saw and lived Hats down to these  cheers to a healthy life and many more Did the survivors of the Holocaust get any sort of government reparations if that is even the right word in this instance I meanjust seeing these dudes and knowing their amazing storyI feel like they should just be set for life Its sad to know that in a few years we wont have many holocaust survivors left Iv never had the pleasure of meeting one of them in person but i would like to someday It brings me joy to see these men who have endured the same hardship have at least found friendship through it all Someone needs to set a camera in front of each of these men and let them just talk for as long as there are data cards to fill No editing no cuts just them a kitchen table and a pot of good coffee Then host them in the national archives so for generations upon generations their stories can continue to be heard My mom was one of the scientists tasked to rebuild and discover what happened to the Columbia shuttle after it broke apart I had planned to sit down with her and do something similar I only shot one short test video to see if she would be into the idea and then she died suddenly The sense of loss is profound I dont even know these men but I know I want to hear them talk for hours May God Bless these gentlemen They are inspirational The handhold hit me in the feels In  we have proud americans waving swastika flags We have concentration camps on the Mexican border filled with CHILDREN We have devout relgious people taking no issue with this though thats not a reflection of all this group What the fuck did my grandfather fight for These proud Americans are making the American flag a symbol of hate They fly it in conjunction with the confederate flag andor the nazi flag This shit is depressing And we have a whole group of americans who pull the i dont believe in them being nazis but i support their freedom to choose that No Fuck you If we cant even agree that there is NO EXCUSE for nazisthat its not something covered by our freedom then we are LOST Tell these men it was fakemy customer lost his whole family in the campsnever forget imagine having that tattoo on your arm for the last  years to remind you of the pain and torture you were put through Serious question how did the tattooing system work Why do the numbers seem to stop in low digits considering  Jewish people were killed  I assume not all were tattooed before death but the numbers only ever seen  digits  When i was younger i was a pool boy for some high end condos One of the residents was this really sweet old lady who would visit with me She was funny and just like company as she had no family One day i happened to notice her arm as she was carrying groceries in the elevator As always i took them and hepled her to het apt Being young and not really knowing how to read the room i asked her about it She was a bit shy at first and only gave a quick short answer that made my face go red and i felt an embarrassment i have never felt since Over the next few days as we talked she started to tell me more Over the course of the year i listened to her stories Even going over after work to sit and listen At times she would be really sad and others she seemed happy to recall some of her memories She passed away the following year but had writen me a note saying how much she enjoyed our talks and how it had helped I will always miss her To any one who doesnt belive the holocaust happened I dare you to come say that shit to my face in person I will happily spend the rest of life in jail to acknowledge what this lady had to go through in life Fuck you Edit im not saying im tough but i will fight for what i belive and if that means jail im ok with that All that eveil needs to succeed in this world is for good men to do nothing Im done arguing with keyboard warriors To thoes who show love thanks I hope you show as much in your every day life I am so angry that this happened Its such a terrible atrocity Bless them Im so sorry you had to live through that Cameras need some software to correct for corner distortion Does anybody else get a kind of sad feeling thinking about how in a decade or two there probably wont be any living survivors of these experiences Seeing these people is a living reminder of a terrible past that should never be repeated as well as a humbling reminder of the power of human will and bravery to survive and thrive against all odds It will be sad when we no longer have a direct link to amazing people like this fuckthenazis More OG Antifa If anyone is interested in learning about experience of a prisoner in nazi concentration campthere is a book by viktor Frankl called mans search for meaning Its been a long time since I saw or touched one of those tattoos Thank god in a way but on the other hand what a shame They are POWERFUL reminders of where we have been and warnings of where the right wing is trying to take us now I think Ill get Never Again tattooed on my left forearm This is beautiful I genuinely cant understand the people that say the holocaust was a hoax How can they genuinely believe such nonsense It wasnt even that long ago relatively speaking I just dont understand it Sucks they have to watch the rise of fascist shitheads again America could have done more to help the Jews leading up to the war but thank God that the US and our Allies defeated Nazi Germany May all Nazis rot in hell forever My turn next week httpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsgephcmamazing httpswwwredditcomrpicscommentscwvrrthesejewishmenarrivedinauschwitzonthe httpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsblkeamazing httpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsblmjvsthesejewishmenarrivedinauschwitzonthe httpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsdcmpuwthesejewishmenarrivedinauschwitzonthe Shitty tattoo artist of you ask me Would be a nice picture if it didnt hurt my eyeballs to look at rshittyHDR Antifa exists so nothing like this happens again And yet they keep trying So glad to see survivors reunited Really made me smile the fact they lived through that hellhole and if they are living in the US and they can still see dumb fucks flying the nazi flag must be a surreal feeling not religious at all but I hope they live a peaceful life after this one for their sake If anyone were to deny the Holocaust around me I might have to throw hands no lie I do not get the story fully Did they already know each other in Auschwitz or did they get to know each other only after the war Why I am asking as far as I know the numbers were restarted after a while to make it impossible for the victims to keep track of the number of victims In that case they might have arrived on different days PS fuck you Hitler What those eyes have seen Do your part by reporting the holocaust deniers First off this is badass and these gents are badass second the amount of negative bullshit comments on here make me weep for the state of this country and this planet yall unbelievable Thank God for the Red Army It my turn next to post this We all to be careful of rise in right wing ideologies i visited Aushwitz a few years ago when i was lucky enough to be travelling i remember listening to a recording of a survivor telling his story of entering the camp and having all of his belongings taken away and being stripped of all his clothes he said that what was hardest and most sad for him was when they shaved his head they were took away my personality is what he said so heartbreaking to hear ill never forget it he said he cried after they did it but he felt stupid for crying Is the guy on the right famous I feel like Ive seen him before I feel like the one on the right would be fun to hang out with The one in the middle would chastise me The one on the left would leave me worried as he doesnt look as well as the other two This image has more power than Ive ever seen They should of tattooed all of the surviving nazis with dicks Imagine having that tattooed on your arm the stories they must have must be crazy Still unimaginable that this happened in modern times and to think some are still alive Sad day when theyre not around anymore thats life I guess I cant even begin to fathom how atrocious it was in there Respect survivors god bless Fuck what a dark time in human history Heartwarming picture though Congrats gentlemen You out lived Hilters sorry ass  iT nEvEr HaPpEnEd some dickhead online I never will forget a joke an old Jewish woman who also had her tattoo from Auschwitz on her arm told me This was in the mid s It was neat as hell this joke coming from her Here it is A man was golfing He accidentally hit his ball into a batch of buttercup flowers He tip toed into those flowers making sure to not harm any flower before and while hitting his ball out of the flower patch Then from above he heard Boom  this is God I am impressed that you were careful to not hurt any of those flowers So as a reward I am granting you to have all the butter you want for the rest of your life The man responded where the hell were you yesterday when I hit my ball into that batch of pussy willows Just so these guys know I met this lady in Houston Texas I am grateful I never experienced the shit these gents have seen I bet they remember those horrid memories like it was yesterday Heroes And do we not fucking learn They are so strong they went trough this its so horrible what happpened I hope they take care and I hope the best for the three take care everyone please take care My great aunt and grandfather from my stepdads side still has their tattoos theyre actually guest speakers at the Museum of Tolerance and the stories Ive heard are just heartbreaking It just amazes me that people can look at a time like that and unanimously agree that it was disgusting but people will turn a blind eye to similar things happening in the world today I have met the man in the middle a few times as does lectures at the college I attended It was very sad to hear his stories but he always got his message across Nazis were terrible people and that we should not stand by like before and let their message of hate spread Unfortunately I feel that message fell upon many deaf ears roldschooluncool You know cuz nazis Edit oh thats a real sub Of course And I naively thought this could never happen again They can be a great voice for what evil can do Never again Which one is magneto tho  ELI why do the tattoo numbers never get to  or higher Fuck your nazis Is that Robert De Niro These men lived full lives because we used to do the right thing Would we even care today Hey its my buddy Chap in the middle is a family friend He went to a Jewish youth club with my grandma after the war Super nice guy he comes to the UK now and again for a visit Fuk NAZI never again we allow these monsters roam the earth Lest we not forget Or ir will repeat itself Cant believe theres groups out there denying the Holocaust awesome photo Werner Reich comes to the school I work at His talk is always great I am sad for the day where he cant come anymore Honestly the most badass tattoo you can have  badass mofos right there Haters will say its fake God bless these  They were put through some of the worst of what humankind is capable of Those guys experienced shot we cant even imagine They are badass heroes  I never thought Auschwitz tattoos could ever be wholesome Kinda epic Whats the point of tattooing these people I feel like this belongs in rnevertellmetheodds Three absolute badasses And everyone said tattoos would look stupid when you got old So it did happen I knew it s The holocaust was disgusting Unfortunately somewhere on this planet there is another one happening and we just turn a blind eye Survivors This breaks my heart Just the thought of it I cant believe theres still people alive from then Just amazing piece of history and humanity right here The mans smile on the right added some depth to the emotion of this photo What happened in Aushwitz was terrible and disgusting I dont know how anyone could even share a single beliefs with Hitler while partially acknowledging what happened in these camps That is so wild Damn the Holocaust was not that long ago The Tattooist of Auschwitz is an awesome book I read recently christ what they must have seen This might seem like an odd comment but I take a great deal of comfort from this If these guys could get through Auschwitz and the horrors inflicted upon Jews during those times its possible to come out the other side of such things and get on with your life Its tragic that they had to go through it but at least theyve survived and the man on the rights smile shows how strong the human will can be Those eyes tell a story As a German I will fight fascism where ever it occurs This is my heritage In german antifascist groups we have a sayingKein Fubreit dem Faschismus which roughly translates to no foot wide for fascism Dude in the middle looks like my grandpa damn My family is lucky we mostly got out before the holocaust but this is still hitting me really hard I miss him Makes me realize how much worse things could have been if they hadnt escaped a few decades before it happened And I think I have had bad days always something to change your perspective Bububut the holocaust wasnt real I know this because the internet never lies That middle guy has a look that says Yeah Im still here What about it And its very cool Thats incredible Heroes Thats a powerful image Also fuck all Nazis Dont you just love how people are legit out there that think this didnt happen I cant understand how someone can survive to Auschwitz and live so long after remindme in  days Remindme In  days urepostsleuthbot Mazel tov Nice watches God thats insane I remember listening to a man called Harry Bibring who went to school and told us his story about living as a young jewish boy in Germany during WW He was a part of the kindertransport program and was generally a great speaker Sadly he died a few years after I heard him speak which was upsetting but I think he had a good life This looks like a lit music video all the flat earthers will say its fake  The middle one looks a bit like Robert De Niro Met him on set of AntManworking as a talent PA handler he was the kindest celebrity Ive ever met on set After spending a week around him we would chat in between takes Towards the end of the shoot I told him I was a fan of the whole MCU so he pulled me over and introduced me to Kevin Feige when he came to set one of the days I will never forget that moment Paul Rudd is a legend Cant believe hes  Looks great He truely is the golden retriever of people Isnt that the guy from the NFL network taking the picture Just a little story of how my fairytale of a day came to be Im a waitress in Brooklyn It was pouring rain and nobody was coming in Suddenly he came through the door and my heart started beating super fast He had a mask on but I knew instantly Im a native New Yorker and have met my fair share of celebs but this one This one is so special Anyway I got my shit together and went over acting soooo casual and I was soooo smooth and Im like hey mind if I take your temperature And hes like sure thing And Im like oh my god  degrees and he looks at me puzzled and says no way and I said JK and he genuinely laughed and we kept making jokes and vibing throughout the  hours he sat there and when he was about to leave I said Hey Paul Rudd I know this is unprofessional but youre just a legend and Id love to take a socially distanced picture and hes like are you kidding You were great and I dropped some obscure reference from a sketch he did on Tim and Eric celery man and then enthusiastically starts posing for our photos Then he left me a  dollar tip on a  dollar check When he was leaving we exchanged sincere I love yous and then I proceeded to melt because I think this means me and Paul Rudd are engaged now You handled that with grace and charm I would have started crying like a  year old at a BSB concert in  Turns out he was handing out cookies to people waiting in line to vote todayhttpstwittercomrexchapmanstatuss Aaaaand now you got Ants Thats so cool I saw footage that he was in New York filming a new MCU movie youtubeKlesYdYkMhttpsyoutubeKlesYdYkM I am infinity jealous Paul Rudd is all kinds of awesome Im a straight male and Im in love with Paul Rudd Paul Rudd is like this generations Tom Hanks Absolutey beloved and appears to be genuinely kind Cant find a bad story about the guy Look at us I live in Kansas City where Paul Rudd is from Hes actually still really involved here and is seen around town a few times each year He is our golden child We love and protect him at all cost He is a treasure of a person The rarely seen quadruple hover hand Thanks COVID This mask is getting in the way of my sweet pic  Cameraguy probably Did he kick up the ddd Hes handing out cookies to voters waiting in line httpstwittercomrexchapmanstatuss Dude looks even younger than the last photo I saw him in He has a painting somewhere that is growing more hideous by the minute Youll be older than him in  years I mean thats not that socially distanced but who on earth could stay any distance away from Paul Rudds face for a second I know I couldnt Yo Its Saarela Im so proud of you you beautiful human being He invited everyone to his parents house in KC to party after the royals won the world series XD Bobby Newport Paul Rudd is most certainly not a dud Thats certified young person Paul Rudd Did he order a venti Is Peter Schrager the one taking the photo He looks like a fella I knowTayne He was on Good Morning Football this morning on NFL Network He was delightful as usual Thats cool and all But whats up with that ddd Someone compared my personality and dancing to Paul Rudd and it was the greatest compliment Ive ever received Thank you lady from Eddie Bauer So amazing Always hearing nice things about him that doesnt seem like  ft and he was just passing out cookies to ppl standing in line to vote He is so anti Trump he has huge hands Paul Rudd has forever changed my the way I take photos of my friendshttpsyoutubegWVHsesGCYt Do you work by Barclays He was standing outside the exit and gave me a cookie after I voted yesterday Look at that face He never ages I swear if  takes Paul Rudd from us I am just going to go apeass crazy Hes from KC so that explains it all Is that Peter Schraeger taking the picture Dude taking that pic sporting that one ear mask technique Im still confused how is Paul Rudd in the picture while also taking the picture Bobbbbyyy Neewwwpporttt In Australia one of our prominent politicians a recent Prime Minister but we go through them like a hookers tacklebox so dont be too impressed httpsenwikipediaorgwikiKevinRudd has the same last name so whenever we get the entertainment news about Paul Rudd I am momentarily confused Its so interesting that most big stars have large heads Not in a bad way either I think it just makes them show up on screen better Someone said it a while back and I cant stop noticing now Its always more apparent when theyre out with fans and what not Such a huge fan of his and sooo happy for you Thanks for sharing this small moment of joy somewhere in America today Guy ages so slow What does he eat Whats his secret more like paul studd What the hell

httpsthehillcomblogsintheknowintheknowpaulruddhandsoutcookiestolonglinesofearlyvoters Peter Schrager from gmfb is the one taking the pic  Its crazy that the guy who is taking the photo has his mask

board with you For  seconds I thought this was Luke Wilson saying how our election was like the movie Idiocracy Is that attached to him Id hate to wear a costume that required to stand for hours on end Also dude should probably have some more spaghettisoupketchup stains on his shirt Eating dinner on the couch or recliner without a manbib means stains always Still wearing pants and shoesfancy are

way Its not like  was an awesome year Lol you got this Such a great costume at first sight I thought this was the streamer JoshOG This wins Halloween I love this I honestly thought that was Luke Wilson in fancy dress I dont think anyones  didnt involve sweatpants Love the little details like his pocket being empty I think my parents have that exact same oven and microwave combo Lol Damnn  Thats an original costume You need half a mask bro Clean your fucking fishtank Wait when is Halloween deleted Very nice but I would have given extra points for only half a tie The  side needs more hobo style facial hair but otherwise great cozy If I were to offer any constructive criticism it would be to wear half a mask  anyways The top part of the  you looks like the Incredible Hulk with the tattered sleeve and all You should have worn bedroom slippers too but that wouldve probably messed with your standing Otherwise your costume made me laugh Good job  Nice no half mask What happened to your clothes in  Why they ripped Before after before after I just spent the past  minutes attempting that half smile half frown thing youre doing s been good to me First year in a new city Got married Got a promotion Got a new house Building a full AMD rig next month Lifes good The duality of man If it is real it is not costume Reminds me of the Vaughns progression in tales from the borderlands

doppelganger and having a great costume Which I totally get now You should get someone who looks like you and dress up as our prediction for  also Because Im sure everything will be peachy s Some serious detail went into this costume Great work Love the half beard and combed hair Genius  I love it I would add some eye shadow and wrinkles to the  side well done regardless The DualiDEAN of man

Luke Wilson really going all out for Halloween this year Castaway vibes Tape half of a mask to your face  sucked too This is the best halloween costume Ive seen Good job sir Wheres yer mask Clean your aquarium The toilet paper is a nice touch The smile wins bro I like that pocket tug Nice touch Tru You forgot a mask on your  half If only he could have gained a good fifteen pounds on his left side then this would be truly perfection Get a mask for half your face The toilet paper is where I lost it Those are the mullet of pants Party on the right business on the left Good for you for putting together a clear and creative Halloween costume I tried to be a hipster shaggy one year and everyone just thought I was a stoner Clever That line on your face is freaking me out Could not explain the  years better Job well done my friend Got that half smile Pre nd Post covid Two face Nice I thought for a second it was Luke Wilson or a perhaps a guy dressing like Luke Wilson Still undecided Creative I approve Unhappy Halloween Needs to be holding a ballot I thought this was Luke Wilson Is that Luke Wilson  I dont give enough of a fuck today to come up with a comment He even pulled off a frown on the  side Bravo Hard to handle the deep truth in this pic The commetment to shave half the beard is the best part Your genius is overwhelming Before the night out and after the night out this feels very familiar Great job on the costume happy Halloween bud  The  side should be holding packs of disposable masks and a gallon of hand sanitizer But this is an epic costume I feel like  needs a black eye to really capture the spirit of the year TWO FACE WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HARVY So youre New Years Eve  The way you did your tie is pretty awesome To make it more real the  version should not be wearing a shoe I never wear shoes any more What fish If he could somehow wear half a mask thatd be top notch Spent it all on a s era kitchen Nice collection of oil lamps Only thing that would have made this better would be if the kitchen was trashed instead of neat and tidy Maybe somebody can ps a burnt out kitchen over it This is super trippy Took johnny sins too far i fucking cant do thathow do you do that He wins  i see you got the x  So good I literally have those same socks Buffalo right Wau Just need a mask dangling from the left ear Why is  not wearing a mask Is he American Should of did a half face mask Bloody brilliant that Something needs to be on fire for the  side That is the best costume ever I hope you win a contest I remember in January I got a new job and was so excited about my life finally starting to move forward  months later I was laid off Good times in  httpsuniversityallworldblogspotcomexplorenepalhtmlhttpsuniversityallworldblogspotcomexplorenepalhtml Epic You look like if Owen and Luke Wilson had a baby I dont know whether to laugh or cry at this Its that good You look like both Slow Mo Guys merged into one Brilliant Carpet in the kitchen Man  is rough How does he do the half smile half frown American Psycho vibes I HAVE TO GO TO THE BANK TODAY No MASK Love it Oh bro you dont wear black shoes with khaki pants Awesome costume though Luke Olsen Nice For a moment I thought you were missing a leg TIFU by hand stitching my costume and having a wardrobe malfunction I feel like the  half should be pajamas Working from home all the time I have to force myself to change out of PJs Bonus point for an I voted sticker on the  side So youre going to party on halloween  to male sure this shitshow goes on Nice I like the fish tank So good This is so awesome cheers Cut the top of your sock off it was likely used for TP in March  Sums it up THE EMPTY POCKET LOL IM WHEEZING That is one heck of a costume and beautifully executed Well done Ok you win Halloween This is great the only detail Im confused about is the  half of the shirt being clawed up like a lion attack Also LOL just noticed the empty pocket Nice touch Very creative Its time to do a water change on your fish tank He had to eat his fish  side should be ratty PJs and bathrobe Some bruises preferably of different ages would be a great addition to the  half  if only he could gain  pounds on the  half Is he having a stroke I cant even get close to having my mouth like that Remember when we thought  was the worst year and  was gonna be better Man we were so naive Funny but sad Someone at work won the virtual Halloween contest at work with the same themed costume This execution is better though Should have a joint in your mouth on the  side That is so cool Nailed it The background should be flipped That dirty fish tank definitely should be on the  side Ghoulish greetings rpics patron Have you heard about our spooktacular Halloween Photo

just how old Tony Hawk is now Fuckin legend Its an old throwback costume not from this year I scrolled past this post pretty quickly and I couldve sworn this was Bernie Sanders at first until I

when Im an old white guy  wait  thats it  Ill go as an older whiter guy Larry you fourwheeled fuck I read Tom Hanks and was really confused For a second I thought he was Doc Brown lol They do look a

gestures always fascinate me the level of concentration that seeps up into the hands is crazy like theres a ninjutsu for a kickflip Pretty pretty good Bernie Sanders This is what  needs right now We need more but this helps Why do I see KeeganMichael Key Larry Birdman Tony Shmohawk Nice He looks like Peter from Epic Rap Battles of History Lol Thats freaking great He looks like Peter from Epic Rap Battles of History Either Tony or Larry need to make a show together or Tony should crash a curb film set and make a cameo Finally a Tiny Hawk people can recognize Isnt this from a few years ago Finally Tony has a chance of being recognized But not as himself I mean he is still relatively young for certain things but lets not forget he is already on his s Soon enough he wont need a mask This is the first time Ive ever seen Tony Hawk skating without a helmet and pads He kinda looks like Tony Hawk Looking at Tony and he could probably do a decent seth meyers as well He is still so fucking cool Grew up in the s and he was and still is a god to me From riding his boards reading about him in my skate magazines in Skids way before this thing called the internet watching him in Gleaming the Cube to all the Pro skaters I played because Im too old to still be doing it Forever young he is I thought he was Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future  Thats cool I thought that was Bernie Sanders lol Could pull of being Bernie Sanders too This guy should think about going pro Nice Tony Hawk wins Halloween Wow you look like that Larry David fella Oh really Hmmm nah only from the side Zomg so good Are you sure Larry David cant just do some sick tricks First glance I thought this was Joe Biden on a skateboard Hes totally feeling the Bern in this pic falls of skateboard freeze frame

enthusiasm nice His Social Media is refreshing Gives me hope I like your ollie kid Take this Zinger Thank you Colonel Sanders the sunset was EPIC on Halloween in San Diego Tony was in Vista Pretty pretty good Every time I see a pic of Tony Hawk skateboarding I instantly think of that song in the game TOOOOONY HAAAAAAAWK but turns out they were saying AMOEBA the whole time The old man hands makeup is on point He kind of reminds me of chevy chase For a minute I was thinking how come Tom Hanks was so good on a skateboard tony hawk dressed up as Larry David dressed up as bernie sanders Larry would never skateboard though This cant be real No helmet he must have felt hed seen enough for one life Fuck you Larry Dont you mean Bernie guy at grocery store Wow Hi Mr David Has anyone told you that you look like Tony Hawk Hawk Yes Both be curbin Im assuming thats a skateboard term I aspire to be this cool one day So much talent I mean seriously How much can he even realistically improve his street cred at this point And can he pull it o Jaw crashes into table as eyes enlarge to TXH LemurhttpsyoutubecomwatchvdWpUcoeGhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdWpUcoeG levels I read Tom Hanks and was very confused for a few seconds rphotoshopbattles I just realized how old Tony hawk looks I mean not in this photo but compared to Larry David he looks a thousand I read that as Tom Hanks at first and was really surprised at his skateboard skills Looks more like Chevy Chase Skamtebord My dumb ass thought that was Bernie sanders on a skateboard I thought it was Bernie Sanders hitting the half pipe I am once again asking for you to do a kickflip For some reason I read this as Tom Hanks and was really confused Are you sure this isnt Larry David dressing up as Tony Hawk Kickflip Onto That Curb Your Enthusiasm Until he gets a gigwatt of power and hits mph looks like chevy chase Tony Hawk as Larry David  Chevy Chase as Doc Brown Fuck That sucks This happened in my hometown Mom to be was hit by a driver under the influence Her baby was delivered by csection and mom died Subject James lvarez in memory of his wife Artist and pictures Vanessa Marie Carbajal Edit some are asking what this is Day of the dead is a mexican tradition that has its roots in aztec and catholic customs during which we celebrate and remember those who lived and welcome them into our homes Da de muertos is not a sad holiday however mexicans see death as something one must one day smile to The dead are not gone they are with us and thus we share and eat and decorate the ofrenda with beautiful colors the pictures of the deceased are placed as the centerpiece their favourite food drinks and posesions waiting for them to arrive guided by the candles and cempaschil in nhuatl  flowers flowers By remembering them they live and we stay together Edit  She was ran over by a drunk driver when she was  months pregnant and the baby was born via emergencycsection Edit  Ive been contacted by the photographer who had not been credited for photo added the corresponding credits Thats really beautiful and sad at the same time Im bothered by how this has been flared as Halloween This isnt Halloween this is Dia de los Muertos Hes honoring the dead not dressing up for Halloween Its a sad time but well done the artist expressed his pain beautifully Mad respect to him I lost my wife  months pregnant with our son So I know exactly the difficulty he is facing and the blessing he has received Holy fuck That picture hurts I cannot imagine trying to raise my three year old without his mama Man Thats a lot We were in Mexico for our honeymoon during Dia De Los Muertos and we wanted to see some parades or festive shenanigans We were asking around and one younger guy finally leveled with us and was like Its really more of a personal holiday But didnt explain much further This picture speaks to that sentiment really well and now I understand I kinda wish we had more of this in our culture People are so afraid of death and dealing with it I think of losing my Grandparents and how everyone was kind of dicks in helping me deal with it and its still frustrating to think about I think all of our mental health would be better if we spent a day every year to process respect grieve remember Que hermosa  This is beautiful and heartwrenching Stunning piece of art deleted Couldnt imagine the feelings but coco definitely good to represent those feelings Beautiful picture but why is it flared for Halloween Dia de los Muertos is Nov  not Oct  This hit hard for me I couldnt imagine loosing my partner rift after child birth Everything is already so fucking hard Yo who ever MOD put the tag of Halloween please change that to Da de los Muertos Its not the same Beautiful pic It captures so much Beautiful picture and it makes me intensely angry that it even exists Ive had two close friends killed by drunk drivers Every time you hear another story like this you feel some of the pain all over again This poor girl has to grow up without a mother and one day may have the added burden of survivors guilt If ever there was an photo album that demonstrated the importance of culture this would be the front cover Nowhere near the same as actually losing your spouse but in my last labor there was gross malpractice that caused me to bleed out and almost die I was unconscious for a very long time I remember looking at my husband and telling him goodbye and screaming to see my baby one time before I died I got a glimpse of her and it was the last thing I saw but my husbands wail of shock and pain I heard after I started drifting off Ill never forget it the sound was something I dont think anyone could I couldnt imagine the pain of this man but I commend him for standing up and showing everyone the outcome of their actions if they choose to drive drunk This is a beautiful photo for so many reasons and should be displayed as a piece of art I saw the article about this man losing his wife to being killed by a drunk driver and the baby being saved I cried when I saw the photo of him holding their daughter with the mom added in the photo Oof when I realized what it was that stung She is on your ofrenda so she can cross over and be with her child Bruh this brings tears to my eyes God Bless You All For my Sofrenda I hold her for you and I As she sleeps like youve slept On this day of the dead Where Ive no room left to hide As I miss you dearly And I light these these candles In this quiet room So it will be the rest of our night until our farewells and goodbyes Oh and dont worry my love Well be here next year Around the same time So for now lets enjoy this ths beautiful silence because from death can come life This is such a beautiful photo and also incredibly heart wrenching I cant imagine the grief he must feel Thats a new baby so this is likely his first Day of the Dead memorializing her I cant imagine the pain and survivors guilt he must feel Beautiful photo though incredible She was a Disneyland Cast Member killed by a drunk driver She was pregnant  her baby survived  May her memory be a blessing Oh man the feels This hit me like a high five in the face with a brick Remember me  This brought me to tears Im literally crying as I write this  years ago tomorrow I lost a cousin who was the age I am now to a blood clot From one day to the next she was gone just like that I think this hit me so hard because the last time I saw her alive albeit on a respirator was on Halloween night when I arrived at the hospital and less than  hours later she was gone She had a baby less than a year old and somehow he still remembers his mom from pictures alone its both beautiful and tragic My cousin was like an older sister to me who took care of me all the time when I was younger and had a personality everyone loved Onde quiera que estes cuida tu nio primita lastima k no lo pudiste ver crecer Te amo y te extraamos Im sorry for your loss but this is whats beautiful about our Mexican tradition the dead will never be forgotten Dead is just another path one that we all must take Oh the poor guy and poor baby who will never know hisher mom What a senseless waste And

in sometime I hope you find peace May you live the happiest of life I cant evenDamn This is powerful This is a heartbreakingly beautiful picture Until the last time her name is mentioned she will be remembered I do not know if that is an too overly simplified I am open for more education telling of how death and the dead is viewed in the Hispanic belief systems but I found what little I have put together over the years as a beautiful memorial practice and this image does not soften that belief jn the slightest Tragically beautiful Woah I know these people Theyre friends of a friend Quite tragic and sad but its heartwarming to see the global support they are receiving My mom died giving birth to me but like me I know this kid has a dad that will rise to the challenge and everything will be as good as it can be What an in incredibly moving tribute So sad  Ive already cried once today do not make me do it twice god this is to much sad  Im sorry for your loss Devastating but a beautiful homage to his late wife Dude its been like  years since I cried on Halloween Whyd you have to break my streak Please take this with the spirit it is intended but I can only think of one word

arrests before as well according to the news report Ive always appreciated how Mexican culture has a day just to honor loved ones who have passed This is beautiful and heart breaking at the same time I love it a great tribute I recognized your wifes picture from the news My wife and I live about a mile from where it happened It broke our heart when we saw it on the news that evening Im so sorry for your loss brother A few hours after our daughter was born my wife started to hemorrhage huge amounts of blood She passed out and the postpartum nurses didnt know what to do Fortunately my wife is a labor and delivery nurse so her friends from the PACU came up and rushed her back down They ended up transfusing like  units which I think is about half the blood a person has Thankfully due to that quick response by her fellow nurses she is alive and well But every day I imagine if she had bled out would I have had the strength to raise our daughter alone You are amazing man I was not prepared to feel this way This breaks my heart into a million pieces but this is a beautiful piece of art and Im happy to have seen  I dont know nor can I imagine what this feels like We just had our first child a couple weeks ago I dont know what the plan would be if I lost my wife I would fall apart and without time have to somehow put the pieces together in order to care for the last bit of whats left of her our baby I hope I never have to experience that and I genuinely hope that you love that child until your bones rattle that your will is strong and that you have a strong family which will support you and your baby throughout your lives My condolences but more importantly my hope for both of you Fuck Im crying And now Im crying This is beautiful I Couldnt even begin the imagine the range of emotions youd feel in this situation One on hand youve lost your partner on the other you have this new little life to care for As a newly pregnant mom this is terrifying Im so sorry Omg This

man That is beautifully heartbreaking Wow Powerful photo What a horrific thing for a man to go through  This broke me  Fuck that is sad Well fuck This is the most beautiful thing Ive seen in sometime Thats horrendous and really sad but really beautiful too My wife was hit by a drunk driver who had suspended license for DUI and it took  months to get insurance to do anything because it took  for the trial He pled not guilty because hes a douche and was in the middle of a trial for discharging a firearm drunk but not DUI because his keys werent in the ignition Thats been a while and I dont know what hes doing now but he did NOT go to jail and the people that kept him from driving off were state law enforcement that were two cars behind They literally jumped out and stood on both side of the car and the enormous one shouted stop and dude froze Then laughed with the EMT checking him out Im ok with that day because my wife is physically ok now but that guy wasnt and isnt done doing that crap and who knows the toll by the time hes done I mean that was his rd But that insurance money and government fine makes a lot of people money Repeat customer I love that this is a beautiful way to remember our loved ones Im so sorry for your loss  How painful it must be Beautiful and nicely done   fiesta stops Wow Supportive Beautiful and heartbreaking This hurt Dang This kills me Extremely

Halloween but if your uncle fester wants to repeat the costume its a great additional accessory Uncle Fester has my vote You all killed it Those costumes are awesome so cute Nailed it Reminds me of this great Bush quote I frankly felt like the reception we received on the way in from the airport was very warm and hospitable And I want to thank the Canadian people who came out to wave  with all five fingers  for their hospitality   George W Bush I cant believe youre allowed that close to a vehicle carrying the President I know that limo is like a rolling tank but still If he had a dollar for every time he was flipped off hed be a self made billionaire If you like this picture protect the first amendment folks I see the Beast is still on Goodyear tires She has now officially joined the club httpsiimgurcomXMlzRzpng Political season is the worst Weird that he drove through Falls Church I thought everything past the White House lawn and any of his properties is flyover country I Voted for Biden which is my version of this picture She moved on him like a bitch rconservative is about to leak in here like See the left is just as violent if not more as the guys in trucks running people off the road or the guys at polls with guns harassing people Edit relax The middle amendment Let the hate flow thru you Whenever people say America is a dictatorship I always point out that they are free to do exactly this And its a beautiful thing What a great thing it is to live in a free country where this is not punishable by death Still on Good Year tires I see His mouth writes a lot of checks that his ass cant cash God bless her for standing on the right side of history Well were back to political posts I guess What a shit country Never mind this dirty woman but to see the many people who think this behaviour is great is depressing No wonder this country is done This is America Falls Church represent And the reddit circlejerk rages on edit If its ever Biden or some other Blue person riding around in that thing if someone tried to post the exact same image I guarantee Id bet actual real money on it itd be removed before it hit the front page The bias here is ridiculous And I dont even like Trump but you people are just so laughably blatant rtrashy Woman expresses her first amendment rights toward a man who brags about sexually assaulting women like her Trump would deny every one of her rights if he could But he cant Oh man that is a few miles from my favorite Vietnamese restaurant xB I really do feel sorry for those Secret Service on duty though Thats some heartbreaking stuff that they do take personal at a very low level I wasnt gonna vote but thanks to you lady I have voted Trump Id do this to Obama Wonder if it would make it to the top of reddit Reddit would have seen this act as disgusting and reprehensible if it had been a conservative woman flipping off President Obama And yes it would have been those very things But why do those same Redditors see this womans behavior as heroic Simple Its because leftists are held to a lower standard of behavioras if they are children No question Edit thanks for the stuff st amendment as fuck I have to be honest even though Im sure that itll just earn downvotes in this subreddit but just seems ridiculously childish to me I admit hes a douchecanoe and I understand the sentiment I suppose but it doesnt seem laudable or even useful behavior Just seems like everyone is climbing down to his level rather than exercising any amount of common sense or self control Go vote Thats useful Why is the fascist dictator letting people openly criticize him and flip him off Hes not a very good fascist dictator is he another classy democrat Imagine  if you will Living in a great country you can do this without being shot for it Classy So brave For all you peeps calling Trump a fascist this right here is proof he isnt If he were she would have been arrested and dragged off the street Communist Chinesestyle Thats so brave of her My wife and I decided that in moments of road rage that we would thumbs down people instead of flick them off its like when your parents told you they were disappointed Instead of yelling at you We gotta figure out a way to be kind to each other and communicate more effectively Right now  that woman IS AMERICA Classy So disrespectful Disgraceful This is so ugly on a base level It will be ugly when people do it to Biden too I voted for Trump which is my version of this picture in reverse EDIT Thanks for the badge I wrote this post as a dumb joke Please lets all try to be kind to one another in person and on the internet If this was truly an authoritarian country and Trump was literally hitler this woman would be executed along with her family Stunning and brave Melania Is that you Edgey All you salty redditors will be very upset tonight  Calm down Karen Surprised she was able to get that close to the car Imagine doing this in Iran lol Trump  karma farmer hope her tds is better after her episode I did this to Obama too They see me rollinthey hatin Thats terrific Lol I hope kids see a photo like this in a text book in  years Love how shes leaning in Good eye contact  Little bit odd that we support this kind of behavior Whoever is President should have some respect regardless who it is I disagree with this behavioras its leading our country down a dark hole Shes so mature One doesnt fight unclassy behavior with unclassy behavior This is not becoming Reddit stop endorsing this as positive for anyone regardless of party affiliation But So many Reddit comments continue to talk about how Trump is a dictator and how another  years hell abolish term limits and be an equivalent to KimJing or XiPing But in those countries youll be killed for doing this Like guys cmon hes a bad president not a dictator And if you equate him to that you have no idea how bad other countries actually have it And if I was from those countries I would be insulted with how you would even compare the two removed Wow shes really close I thought they blocked off the street for this Im surprised she was allowed so close Youll make  Reeces peanut butter cups a day trickortreating Not enough stains I know that couch My girlfriend recognized you and blushed what does that mean Edit No you guys have to be wrong with the pandemic and all she lost her job Shes only even left the house for a few evening job interviews and the extra money came from some lottery tickets she bought Do you judge the people that recognize your costume I swear game and fish officer I thought the fish was  long Big wave comes by youll be a couch surfer Im not big into costume posts but that is just pretty funny and well done So wet Every time Ive been

carefully Whats a casting couch Ive watched way more of these videos then I care to admit Yeahmy husband had to explain this one to me Are you using jail bait Ba dum bum So that explains the fishy

awesome person I dont get it Honestly I thought you were couch fishinghttpswwwdailymotioncomvideoxjcb Will soon be soggy and smelling of fish  Thats Reely funny Never mind the couch  she really knows

there is no fish Dude Lemme try out I have a facesitting move that will floor her Nice reel Van Staal VR Real talk if those cushions flip up you have the potential for an awesome wearable cooler Catch a fish chuck it in the box on the left grab a fresh beer from the right Just dont mix that up Im appalled but I am impressed I love the absolute chaos that is this picture The amount of effort that went into this pun is incredible Is that a Van Staal Weird the first casting couch Ive seen without a dick Oh my god thats awful Well done  Take your upvote and get out I thought the reel was someone

stains Got any change in there Fcuk Stepsis got stuck in the couch cushions again Someone explain the fishing part of this Shes gotta be in one of videos who can find out For science Paid by the hour If this is OC let the folks at rcableporn know about it Or you know just put in  conduits and not look at all those wires Just sayin As an electrician my jimmies have been thoroughly rustled Yeah no This is shit work Its a huge waste of time The bends on the romex throughout are way too tight stapling is severely overdone and what the hell is the point of those cute little handy box receptacles Installer didnt have a x Couldnt run that jumper straight instead of out the bottoms Whoever mentioned dropping all of this chaos into a couple of runs of EMT was spoton Hell even Smurf tube would be an improvement over this  Imagine this as a task for Among Us As a electrician this is just a waste of wall space and panel knockouts how do you add to it I cant even imagine being married to whoever did that Xray image of what the cable management looks above the ceilinghttpsiimgurcomZaAejpg Make a  hours job a  hour job This is a horrid installation Why would you take up all your panel space like that For fucks sake all of that could have been ran in  conduits This looks nice but yikes Honestly it bothers me Its super neat but I feel like it should all be loose inside a duct and just smashed into the side of the enclosure lol Like someone spent way too much time just to make it pretty And theyre all clipped down to hell so its not like they need to be removable or accessible And theres tight bends too Urgh And thats a huge amount of surface areas worth of cables that could be damaged Its just impractical A self installer with far too much OCD has done this because theres no way youd accept a bill from a contractor who just wasted  hours making your wall look like an art piece How funny if behind the doors its a tangled mess doesnt this go against electrical codes shouldnt it be in EMT My network administrator approves this picture  Better cable management than I have for the  things attached to my tv This guy was on MG of adderall no doubt I bet all those breakers are also clearly labeled mmmm yeah thats what I like Dude its nnn chill out you almost made us lose Dont know how old this is or wherebut not even close to any code I know of This looks like unprotected romex stapled to a wall Conduit for main feed and feed between panels but all the rest is super dangerous Hey red whyd you take so long on you task Kinda sus I was in electrical doing the wiring i promise I was a low voltage tech hated having to crawl into a manhole and decipher the acronyms and trace wires that lead nowhere If I saw this in a mdf I would shed a single tear of joy This is soooo sexy Is that conduit or cable Is that even up to code No flex or conduit Behind that ceiling tile is a rats nest of wires Hey I changed my mind and Id like to add a generator sub pannel I thought this was ribew for a second Put it behind the wall Minimalistic is better if you want to add one more cable it would mess up everything If you were paid by the job you would be broke Is that romex free flying between the handyboxs This is prime handyman work Absolutely terrible as an electrician Obviously paid by the hour Why not just have  bundles running up Im thinking this is made to last and you dont have to do any extra work on it so having just  flat bundles running up would look better To make it even more easier why dont they tag the cables with simple numbers or some sort of Id Looks nice but should have been piped for the sake of protecting the conductors from damage and people from electric shock should any jacket become damaged exposing the conductors within As someone who comes behind sparks plumbers etc to fill in for firestopping I fecking love the guys that are meticulous about their cable management It looks amazing and ensures I can do my job correctly without any fuckery Nice work buddy It is nice to see how much pride you take in your work Thank you for sharing Trash Your wiring is beautiful I have seen a similar junction box with the wires all left in a tangle This was all contained in a glass fronted cupboard thing up on a wall in a corridor corner I always looked up at it every time I had to use the corridor on the way to chemotherapy I was always a bit shocked that this was in a hospital Lol Something is happening in my pants rcableporn As a licensed master electrician this would and should not pass inspectionit doesnt look good it takes up entirely too much room and time OP got killed by an impostor shortly after posting this Arent those wires supposed to be concealed in conduit What electrician would leave exposed wire That one Orange on the right Ur the reason i failed no nut november Awesome to look at but somewhere in my brain is the nagging thought that without conduit it cant be to code It looks nice but it could have been done in a much more space efficient way Sexy only if you know nothing about wiring its sexy until something hits it and kaboom Clearly a Union job Waste of time and wall space If you want it to look nice you run  conduit out of the box and into a trough at the the ceiling so you have no cables showing at all Then you can go whereever you want with your NM And installing two single gang boxes adjacent the panel with NM Like this guy didnt have a single scrap of EMT hanging around Electroboom visible happiness So did you clock out for all this extra time that gives no benefit to the customer or did you just say fuck your customer and charge them an extra  for nothing Why would you waste soooooo much time doing this Dont you guys have trunking over there  My old boss would have played hell with me for taking so long to do all that This is so stupid why would you do this Journeyperson electrician from Canada here This is just terrible A waste of time and why God why couldnt this person at least double up some of the wires Every bit of space on the wall is gone Plus its such a mess Awful Although it is laid out very precisely it just seems ugly to me When the wiring on the wall takes up way more space on the wall than the panel it just looks off for some reason Is that emt and if so is there a trough up there or is it piped out straight to the j boxes Meanwhile mine looks like a bowl of exploded spaghetti Dam straight I wonder where the red wires go What dam is this in Looks good dont often have the space to spread it out That little jumper between outlets is cute It has been said that he is still running the wire for this house today Is this for when theyre paid per hour vs a salary job You didnt have to run all that through grounded electrical conduits This is aesthetically pleasing I wish the back of my pc looked like that wouldnt it be better to have those wires armored It aint art it is electricity Im not sure this would pass inspection in the US but its pretty Lol then theres both receptacles wires gross af  Why not use a gutter Or a few since for some reason they seem to be differentiating types of circuits out of the same panel I mean its cool looking but holy shit all the wasted time When you want to reset the circuit breaker and suddenly you see a spiderweb Goodluck Pretty sure he was speaking ItalianhttpsyoutubeJdFEtbnw They left no space for future growth though ooft Sexy sure But is it labeled properly Thats a first job outa school run there  see I can do the job just like my grad test Im no electrician but this seems like a bad idea damn The it guy that came to my house to set up built in surround sound and he fixed and organized my fuze box The below is relevant httpsmyoutubecomwatchvFacltAiAGA You have a containment unit in your basement Theres a fine line between taking pride and efficiency Safety first hoes How do you figure out a pattern like this I understand that Im looking at some form of wire management Idk what its for but Im here for it Damn Id be happy if my git history looked that good Yall bitches need to put that shit in some pipe A child can bend wire Look at all those wicks So what are those panels Power supply controls for the dam Canada  I wish the whole world was like this My wife is always asking me What turns you on Im sending her this picture I can pretty much guarantee this will be the best thing Ill see on the internet in the next hrs Thank you As an electrical contractor I feel this is a waste of time and space I would hate to have to add to that in the future although it already looks to capacity with the amount of wires going in You know they make larger panels As a former installerI am rock hard right now Fuck I wish my wiring in my  year old basement looked like that Its a maze down there Im an industrial controls engineer and this makes me very happy Its like wiring porn I came  Is very nice but shouldnt that be in conduit Tell him about the Twinkie That is sexy Why am I now wet This is what non electricians imagine talented electrical work would look like There goes my no nut November My electrician friend said that this is shit Well this boner was unexpected Why yes it is Nice antennas you made there God this is erotic This is so ridiculous everytime I see it I cringe Why would you want your wires to be spread out and exposed like that Either dump the wires into a trough or bring them in with a conduit or just bring them in the top This is just such a waste of time I cant stop staring at the lowest cable between the plugs without support I wonder what it looks up above once its all hidden IDK that jumper between the two  outlets on bottom right of photo is pretty weak Great job on it but ate up most of the profit on the extra time spent getting it to look like that I can definitely appreciate the detail and organization tho damn i guess you werent faking wires I mean it looks good but Id imagine its far from good if youre going to do any sort of maintenance on that Im enjoying reading the comments from electricians whore eviscerating this picture based on how impractical it is Drywall hole around the pipe ruins it though Someone took their kids adderall lol as a commercial electrician this looks like a mess at first glance That isnt the work of an electrician but maybe a crossover data guy rcableporn xB damn this is sooo clean I love it Bravo Bro stop making NNN so hard Are those pipe joints brazed Kinda looks like it but I cant quite tell Yeah thats gonna fail an inspection around here I hope you dont get paid salary Man make sure no one follows you into there In another life I was an electrical contractor for a long time The guys who made up the neatest panels were the same ones who were high all day Just sayin It is so organized I think I am going to fail nnn cuz this image makes me horny I amp turned on Damn lewd beeping Among us time BEAUTY One word HOW Expected this to be on relectricians Is this real masterpiece Looks like the work of The Fiber Ninja I almost came just thinking about how easy cabletracing would be Damn thats impressive How many man hours did you burn up making it look that good D How did you get out alive Theres a vent right beside that task Oooh baby I give it a  Hi im a toxic redditor I hate Canadians Perfection Ghoulish greetings rpics patron Have you heard about our

post I am happy to see Regardless of your political view you should be happy an innocent man was set free and a miscarriage of justice has started the process of being corrected Congratulations Mr Hinton Your book was amazing and extremely disappointing Edit The Sun Does Shine How I Found Life and Freedom on Death RowhttpswwwaudiblecompdTheSunDoesShineAudiobookBSGFS I highly recommend listening to it as an audio book so you can hear it all all of the emotion Wait Your prisoners cant vote On death row For a crime he didnt commit I am so so angry Well done man it was a terrible unfair fight but you made it through Keep living httpswwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsanthonyrayhintonvoteelectionhttpswwwwashingtonpostcompoliticsanthonyrayhintonvoteelection Anthony Ray Hinton did not sleep very well the night before Tuesdays presidential election He woke up at  am showered brewed himself some coffee and not knowing how long he would have to wait made himself breakfast that would stick to his ribs When Hinton was done eating about half past six he drove to the polling location where he would cast his first vote in a presidential election since he was released from Alabamas death row The yearold whose story was featured in the HBO documentary film True Justice is one of thousands of formerly incarcerated Americans who are casting ballots amid a new movement to restore their reentry into society and a reckoning on criminal justice and racism in America In  Hinton was charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of two fastfood restaurant managers in Birmingham Ala with the charges hinging on a revolver that had belonged to his mother Convicted he was sentenced to death and held in solitary confinement on Alabamas death row for  years before being exonerated You dont know freedom until its taken from you Hinton told The Washington Post on Tuesday night Being locked up for  years made me realize how important the vote was He added By not voting you allow people to get into the drivers seat that allows them to oppress you even more Hinton was freed on the morning Friday April   the nd death row inmate exonerated since  according to the Equal Justice Initiative Firearms experts convened by an Equal Justice Initiative attorney testified in  that the revolver was not the weapon used in the murders of the two fastfood managers Hinton was granted a new trial and the charges were dismissed after prosecutors said that the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences determined that the bullets that killed the restaurant managers could not have been used with Hintons mothers gun Hinton wasnt eligible to vote in the  presidential election The Equal Justice Initiative assisted Hinton so that he could cast a ballot for Doug Jones in the  special Senate election In  all of the candidates he voted for were Democrats In  Alabama residents who were previously convicted of felonies were able to register to vote under the Moral Turpitude Act of  Some  Alabamians had completed sentences but still didnt have the ballot according to the Sentencing Project a nonprofit group working to create more fairness in the criminal justice system In recent days leading up to the vote Hinton had been thinking more about his grandparents and his parents who he said werent allowed to vote because of voter suppression such as literacy tests polls taxes and intimidation To me this was a day of freedom dedicated to them and all of the people who have been lynched oppressed or intimidated or disenfranchised from voting From a symbolic perspective it is deeply meaningful that Mr Hinton voted today in Alabama said Blair Bowie legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center which focuses on voting rights restoration Alabamas Jim Crowera constitution openly intended felony disenfranchisement and the biased criminal legal system that ensnared Mr Hinton to work hand in hand to squash Black political power she added Casting a ballot represents a culmination of Mr Hintons victory over that system Voting for the first time was like a breath of fresh air I realized I was there because the wrong people were in office and I had a chance to begin to put men and women that are going to uphold the Constitution Although he spent nearly three decades on death row and solitary confinement for a crime that he didnt commit Hinton said he still feels a kinship with returning citizens whose ballots represent another step in the direction of freedom and contributing to society as a free citizen of the United States As it concerns Alabama however a representative from the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery Alabama said that Hinton has yet to receive an official apology or any restitution due him from the state of Alabama Hinton hopes that will change and his vote on Tuesday gave him hope that it will change soon I couldnt vote at one time in the state of Alabama you couldnt marry outside of your race you had to go to the back to get something to eat This is the state of Rosa Parks who refused to give up her seat  and we changed things through legislation and the vote So I believe in the promise of hope alive he said My god Im only  and cant possibly imagine my entire life being spent in a place like that and JUST NOW starting life What a horrid year to start again but man I hope this guys loving the bestest life now The fact that American citizens still can loose their right to vote in  feels outlandish I know this might sound radical to some across the pond but you know Even incarcerated citizens are still citizens you know the thing that makes up the electorate He should get extra votes for each one he missed Jesus this just makes me sad Thats  years longer than my entire life Fucking insane I hope this guy got a massive fucking settlement so he can overcome the  year gap in his work history on his resume So is he being compensated by being allowed to vote  times These people should get millions of dollars of restitution and a fucking house and the narrow minded detectives and prosecutors who put him there should get damn jail time I legit dont care who he votes but I think he deserves a few dozen extra votes This gentlemans story highlights why the Death Penalty is abhorrent ABOLISH it Righteous Did he get any kind of compensation I would expect millions of dollars for this Wait youre not allowed to vote while imprisoned Very good I do not know this story and I need it Look at that smile Made me smile too If you havent read his book The Sun Does Shine Absolutely incredible Also look into the Equal Justice Initiative and the work Bryan Stevenson and his attorneys are doing for criminal justice reform Its inspiring As a fellow Alabamian I would like to point out a couple things in our state First of look at the by country vote for president and then look at the the house district map that are on google You can see that there is a clear blue belt that exists in Alabama when you look by the county vote for president Now when you look at the districts for house representatives you can see that there is one blue district and five red This is clear gerrymandering in which they packed fit as many Democrats in to one district then cracked diluted the rest of the Democratic counties within more Republican areas the clear democratic area of our state I point this out because assuming that Mr Hinton went back to live were he grew up in Birmingham then his voice as a voter is being suppressed right now It is sad that Mr Hinton has had his life taken away for  years and even now when he is a free man the state is silencing him Alabama is a state that is split  between the parties but because of the staunch control that Republicans have had in this state for so long the minority has no voice Alabama is also a very corrupt state Our current governor Kay grandma Ivey is probably going to be the first governor to not be kicked out of office by some scandal in  years The greatest hypocrisy of this all is that by the federal level the party who has controlled this state for decades is fighting to protect the voice of the minority Simultaneously the same people have worked hard to silence the minority of their own state I want to point this out because even though this is a great message for everyone lets not rest on the fact that this mans fight is not over We live in an unjust state that needs to be called to task to the atrocities that it has committed It frightens me to know that this man was going to pay with his LIFE for something he did not do Incredibly happy for this man and his family  years gone to waste Fuck whoever did this This is why Im against the death penalty Western Australia alone has a terrible historical track record of wrongful imprisonment mainly by crookedlazy cops railroading and stitching up likely suspects Andrew Mallard John Button Daryl Beamish the Mickleberg brothers the list goes on  years behind bars is not refundable but at least there is a light at the end of the tunnel Your life is all you have and ever will have and this is why Im anti death penalty I cant think of how many people in his situation werent able to make it out This is a beautiful moment and you can see the pure real joy on his face What a sad yet oddly inspiring post This picture is so beautiful and the happiness I needed today Im happy to see him smiling But damn that mustve hurt him He should be able to vote for the amount of votes he missed his tie game is strong af His tie and the pure excitement and joy in that one smile are just so sweet Awww hes all dressed up for it and so happy Happy he looks happy Sad that he was locked up for nothing Thats Uncle Phil Imagine being anything but furious all the time after being released from death row  years after a crime you didnt commit Thats a super villain story Damn him laughing in the picture hits me different I dont think I can even smile again if I had  years stolen from my life just like that As a german it seems insane to strip somebody of his right to vote I wonder how many ppl wrongfully die bc of wrongful convictions I love his smile and his forehead voting sticker but also my dude has killer taste in ties apparently Our main man waited  years and ended up voting for Kanye s That sounds like quite pickle seeing as though Kamala has a history of keeping people on death row Good for him The way the US presents downright horrific situations as feel good stories is fucking stupid I understand that no justice system is ever perfect and that false convictions are always gonna happen But denying inmates their right to vote is an affront to humanity just like deathrow itself right on lad I like that he suited up You go Mr Hinton This brings me tears of joy His book is called The Sun Does Shine very inspiring read I literally have tears in my eyes seeing this I love the joy on his face Love it  Great that he regained his voting rights He has an awesome smile so genuine I wish I could upvote this  times Thats so awesome I will always upvote Anthony Ray Hinton His book The Sun Does Shine is beautiful no one else finds this depressing rather patriotic i deadset dont know how americans can feel good about this man having his life essentially ruined but its ok cause he can vote for the country that ruined him Thats an extremely infectious smile very nice pic Fucking hell this is both smile and depression inducing The smile prevails because this innocent man was not just freed but also spared execution for something he did not fucking do Anyone who has spent any length of time in a cell knows just how awful it is bad enough when you have the guilt of knowing what you did but I cannot fathom the feeling being innocent The ONLY silver lining to stories like these is that none of us will ever come close to experiencing the intense joy Mr Hinton did once he realized he was a free man again That said its still a travesty and not worth it in the slightest But that feelingit must be something else Im happy for him Meanwhile in Germany we get to vote even inside of prison Hope the US of A will renew its Laws to make voting more accessible and votes more equal But imagine wearing a jumpsuit with your countystate on it for  years and getting to wear a suit to a voting hall I cant imagine the feeling he must get being called sir instead of inmate I cant imagine going through what he did and still being able to warm peoples hearts with his smile What an incredible man There isnt enough karma in the world to repay him The look on his face warms and breaks my heart at the same fucking time This is wholesome but at the same time it shows how bad the legal justice system is and how innocent until proven guilty is basically non existent The poor guy his entire life was stolen from him  I hope he got the state to pay him back enough to where he could enjoy the remainder as much as he would like but I know that probably isnt the case Republicans dont want his vote to count This man better be a millionaire after all that time he spent in jail Not even money can buy back the time Thats so sad I really like his tie Theres a republican somewhere saying every vote counts EXCEPT FOR VOTES LIKE HIS OF COURSE and we need to make sure theyre all accounted for America is one fucked up country Australian here Putting Republican vs Democrat aside as it is actually irrelevant This is awesome whichever way you cut it America is a shit country At least he didnt get killed I had the pleasure of listening to Mr Hinton speak at my University about his experience in the system Fucking so goddamn tragic One thing that stuck is that he told everyone to picture the size of your bathroom and then picture living in it for  years while on death row The guy never lost hope though Shout out to Bryan Stevenson and ballistic science The fact that he was so wronged by life yet still looks joyful AND participates in democracy is a lesson to us all While thats really messed up youve got to love the mans smile We dont know his life but he seems like hes got a positive outlook now I dont care who he voted for Im just happy hes free rboringdystopia Let felons vote as if being on death row for a crime they did commit is a valid reason to not let someone vote Say it with me if theyre a citizen they get to vote Happy and sad for him He laughed at the candidates list Was this the guy who Kamala blocked evidence of innocence so he stayed wrongfully convicted Did Kamala withhold the exonerating evidence for him sweet home alabamy lord im coming home to you I cant love this more We did a review of his book on No Dumb Questionshttpswwwnodumbquestionsfmlistenwronglysentencedtodiethesundoesshine This needs to be one of the most upvoted things on Reddit What a story  Prisoners are citizens I feel like he should get a backlog of votes for those missed years I want to hug him Actually I want to be hugged by him Thats a beautiful smile this is honestly depressing God better have made a heaven for this man Is he entitled to compensation for wrongful incarceration The joy on this mans face What a trooper I cant believe prisoners are not allowed to vote How could you still be so happy to take part in a country that is actively failing and in fact failing so hard that you spent thirty years waiting to be killed for something you didnt do Thats commendable to say the least At that age I think Id be starting a going out in style hunt unless the people that put me there actually received proportionate consequences EG life in prison for putting me away for so long despite innocence These are the votes that should be worth something not this fucking electoral college Howard Zinn showed me not much has changed Buy his book Its amazing Wait you cant vote if you are in prison Good on him I hate politics but I loved this Wait your not allowed to vote when in prison Theres many more innocent black men in prison who need to be exonerated but this is a good start Give him his  unused votes or riot Screw death row Welcome back to the world These are the first time voting stories Im here for Not kanye deleted Serious question How do you end up on death row for THIRTY years I like his tie I cannot understand that someone can serve  years in jail and are innocent unbelievable he still smile good luck to you Mr Hilton you deserve a beautiful life my friend  They stole his life How barbaric Im so glad we in California passed the proposition that would allow former convicts to vote Everyone deserves a chance As an no American I hope this can be something to show others that we are all human Hello Im not from this country but I feel he Shouldnt only receive one ballot in total he should receive one vote for every local and federal election he was forced to miss Thats only fair Letting him choose when and where he wanted to use them Eg he missed  elections total  federal the rest weird local elections he should be able to vote hypothetically  times for one presidential candidate or save them for future dates If he or others suffering the same situations think its a good time to use them Again just an idea to mull over Sincerely Canada With all the shit going on from this election this is the kinda thing we want too see  MY MAN Republicans really hate this lol His book is wonderful Heartwrenching and awful but wonderful Kamala Joe and the crime bill of  unfortunately lead to a lot of these types of situations Way to go Mr Hinton People in jail should be allowed to vote I hope he has been at least somewhat financially compensated by the government for stealing and wasting a large portion of his life for no reason And thats why death sentence shouldnt be a thing Some might say he is free because the Judicial system worked The New Jim Crow is a good read on the inhumane business of incarceration Its a funnel from purpose built ghettos to purpose built prisons Hoorray for American justice system And its not even about your urge to kill everyone I mean how is it possible a man is found guilty sentenced to death and kept in a cell for  years Did he commit a crime Execute him straight away Was he innocent Let him go Maybe he was pardoned and won a zillion  compensation Even if his entire life is in pieces He cant buy lost  years Our government and policy makers just plain suck We have become such an embarrassment to the world This man deserves every drop of happiness his body can take  He is suing for  million I read The state is fighting having to compensate him because he didnt prove his innocence So many crybaby losers mentioning Kamala while she had literally nothing to do with this But whats to be expected from idiots who congregate on various chans And Im still surprised people still want the death penalty This picture captures the emotion  I mean I agree with you Im not the one you should be telling this to Go tell this Kamala Harris who kept innocent people in jail hiding evidence that could have led to exoneration Or keeping thousands of people in jail on Marijuana charges after Marijuana was legalized Used them for slave labor for the state of CA The Innocence Project has tons of information about this As a Black man Im happy for him As an American and a veteran I find these threads to be super cringey Another reminder of how ardent white America supports and endorses peace from Black men who have been terribly wronged while maintaining hundreds of not so peaceful military installations around the globe The pedantic racism is transparent What crime did he commit Congratulations You know what I dont even care who he voted for The justice for the just is quite satisfying To look death in the face for  years then being told hes innocent by the same system that failed him then turn around and use said system to make sure his voice is heard I applaud you sir However he voted as an American your heart should be happy that he got the chance to do this Would be funny that he voted Trump after all that cause he hates Kamala Harris and her history of unjustified Incarcerations The poor guy obviously didnt follow politics while he was in there because he voted all blue  This is happy but also dont forget that prisoners are being denied the right to vote and thats fucked up Even death row inmates should have the chance to vote Very much deserved Clap xB The GOP however would make sure this guy never voted again  years in prison Wow I hope he got millions Not like that begins to make up for it Hes survived one of the absolute worst things that can happen to someone With the united states incarcerating a huge amount of its citizens compared to anywhere else this kind of crap happens way too often As long as its a business to lock people up its going to keep happening We need prison reform so damn bad For profit prisons are a blight upon our nation Imagine the vote swing if they didnt treat the worlds largest prison population as non citizens or humans really Kamala is probably the person who kept him in prison Plot twist he votes for Trump I think this is an occasion where he would have been totally justified in not voting at all Probably voted for Trump because Kamala is Bidens Vp Thass sweet Shame he didnt get justice for sonlong What exactly is death row though The fact that its possible for an innocent person to end up on death row should be all the reason any intelligent person needs to abolish the death penalty And if this could happen to one innocent person it could happen to any innocent person including you Why would you vote for a crime So first the criminal legal system takes up a huge chunk of his life and now he is happy to be able to vote for an oligarch party Yippee how fucking motivational you Americans are fucking delusional maniacs So he got  votes To make up for lost presidents Well when Kamala gets in office he can go back to jail Did he vote for the candidate whos VP increased felony conviction rates by nearly  in her first few years as a district attorney deleted Dope pink tie bro Hey sorry for being dumb but who is this Give him  votes Yes on prop  After finishing the show Rectify  this story hurts alot more than it would have previously Infectious  Robert Zane sure has aged I wonder if he represented himself Well done you sir I cant pretend to empathise with what you must of gone through during the past decades but I wish you the most incredibly happy life now youre free what a champ My heart the definition of bittersweet How do you stay on death row that long Keep challenging the court This is just lovely Hey thats my state Love you Mr Hinton Thank you I have a feeling I know which way he cast his ballot Man Sometimes I cant believe this place hasnt been burned to the ground His self biography is incredible You know how it ends but you are still on the edge of your seat The Sun Does Shine He seems happy Imagine the check hes going to get being fasley accused and locked up for  Still will not make up for time lost time you cant buy back I wish we could though How the hell do you even stay sane after something like that I cant imagine his surprise after  years had passed that Biden was still running for President  We are watching the process of history being written  In response to the many situations

have too many Catholics among my friends I have one friend who has always been and is deeply religious and practicing She is a mother He works in a sector where it is better to keep a low profile against the government Here it is Today My jaw dropped   PM  Oct   Hello there Reddit Im Polish I see that you need some background information regarding what is going on in Poland Its not as simple as what some people say For a while now Jaroslaw Kaczynskis political party PiS was suffering due to bad decisions regarding covid and some agricultural reforms Country towns  farming communities used to be huge supporter of PiS yet recently PiS introduced some bills that hit directly at farmers Its mainly about baning killing certain animals or even raising them to sell their furs Furthermore due to covid they screwed up with setting up mail voting process for presidential elections which took place this year They lost milions of tax payers money on that They wanted to make sure everyone would vote even though it was middle of a pandemic It was first wave so people were scared and especially elderly people didnt really think much about going to vote So mail vote was their idea to win this Due to some legislature disaster AntiPiS senate held the mailvotebill for their max  days period which made it impossible to set it in motion before the end date during which presidential elections had to take place according to our consitution PiS wanted to be clever and hoped to make it on time so they went with preparing the mail vote system as the bill was processed by the senate They spent milions to prepare it and failed  they didnt make it in time Soooo  because Poland wasnt that much affected by covid we had  cases daily at peaks they informed the public that covid is defeated in Poland to spark higher attendance of elderly people who are mostly loyal towards PiS They won presidential elections by small marging of votes However  this tactic of covid ignorance not only sparked high presidential elections attendance but also made people ignore covid in Poland People believed covid is not our problem anymore including the politicians PiS didnt take so called nd wave seriously All the lockdown measures performed in aprilmay which worked slowed down the spread of virus and in some moments  almost stopped it at one point we had more people being cured daily than getting sick were lifted So here came spetember and october Daily cases are hitting close to k Our hospitals are slowly reaching max capacity Very late PiS response to the epidemic is giving its signs now They tried to buy more ventilators ASAP but the company which was chosen to sell them appeared to be a scam Polish govt again paid milions to get little to nothing in return they ignored all the background check protocols etc Every week is worse than the last Add to this the situation with farmers protesting and latest polls showing that they are losing public support Its a disaster for PiS What we do What we do I know Lets give them something else to focus on It will draw their attention from real problems Lets ask OUR Constitutional Court to analyze  year old abortion policy Ofcourse the verdict is known before procedure starts because head of Consitutional Court is friend of Jaroslaw Kaczynski which he admited publicly So yeswhat was planned is now set in motion Verdict is announced and the public gets outraged They protest JK gets what he wanted So many people out protesting together Finally someone he can blame the covid disaster on Its them who are spreading the virus in masses We banned gatheings of  people and look what they do Its all planned People got played Kaczynski played them like children who dont want to go to sleep  you tell them a story and they do what you want Additional bonus was the fact that some protesters attacked churches  disturbed the gatherings sprayed some slurs on the walls etc JK used this to unite his recently divided supporters He created an internal enemy who wants to destroy Poland from the inside He even adressed all his supporters and political partners in PUBLIC video clip posted on Youtube Why do think he made it public and easy to access when never before he took such steps Yup  exactly what you think  to play on emotions  to get his supporters back Divide and conquer Nation divided is easy to conquer and rule Since people were starting to face away from PiS siding with the opposition and uniting together  it had to be done Hope I got you this far To end this long post  Polish political situation is complicated I only spoke here about general situation and what was going on I didnt get into too many details because I would have to write a book If someone is into politics recent  years of polish political history is amazing story of how you can legally take over entire country JK is an old and tiny man in posture but inteligent and great tactician If his views were not so outofdate so antieu and driven by populism he could have done great things for this country Abortion crisis is a smoke cover of other issues People were driven out to the streets by emotions and thats exactly what JK wanted Never underestimate him and his decisions Political power is all that he has left in his life he has no wife no children  only his cat kind of like the bad villain from early James Bond movies He wont give it away cheap EDIT thank you guys for the gold and kind words of feedback Looks like I did my job by spreading awarness  which was my main goal Situation like the one in Poland right now can happen in your country as well Dont take any freedoms in your life for granted For those who dont know   Abortion is already banned in Poland  Until now there were three exceptions when the mothers life is in danger in cases of rape or incest and in cases of severe and irreversible fetal defects  In a ruling on October nd the piscontrolled Constitutional Tribunal said that women would no longer be able to cite severe fetal defects as a reason for having an abortion If in case you want to help in anyway There is   Oglnopolski Strajk Kobiethttpszrzutkaplstrajkkobiet eng AllPolish Women Strike is the one that organizes protests and these women are everything  Aborcyjny Dream Teamhttpszrzutkaplggx eng Abortion Dream Team are a group of women that help Polish have an abortion so we can do it safely abroad and they often also help financially if someone wants to have one but doesnt have money for that Whats covered in mass media is a tip of the iceberg I have been in Poland for over a week now and I encountered one demonstration and know about another one that took place only few days after During the first one people blocked off a main junction in city centre and stopped all traffic for at least an hour Please dont be fooled when you hear its covid polish people are fed up with Its the government When you hear thousands of people shouting jeba PIS you can feel the anger and frustration like a storm PIS is the ruling party I am sure you can figure out meaning of the other word yourself Demonstrations are organised frequently across the whole country Do you hear the people sing Singing the songs of angry men It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again Why are governments siding against the will of their people at this moment in time I wander It seems like its happening everywhere Pride Month is over It is now Gay Wrath Month If she is flagging that banner through fire and smoke bombs for gay rights in Poland That is the bravest damn woman Fun fact baking soda and water in a rag helps neutralize CS gas  Government turning on its people in the name of protecting fetuses are really just proving the real intent of the law is control of women  belong at the table My ex girfriend is an irish catholic She says that she would never have an abortionbut would never deny women who dont share her beliefs the right to do it Absolutely beautiful what that womans doing but Im terrified that she has to be there in the first place rAccidentalRenaissance I read this as Portland and was ultra confused Why is it still such a thing to try to suppress homosexuality What is their problem I mean I get why you dont want to have the population take drugs or drive too fast or download stuff  but of all the things a government could invest its time in why is two menwomen loving each other such a bad thing that youll rather see your country burn than just let them be I dont get it Im not too religious or anything but did a lil prayer for these brave women Nobody should have a say what a women should do with her body but herself This the gayest most metal thing Ive seen this month and damn if its not cool I live in Poland and I just came out as bisexual Honestly I fear for my life because so many people hate me just because of something that I cant control And Im a woman which means that my rights are already limited Now Ill have to make a choice do I want to be true to myself or alive Fuck PiS our government basically If you are a decent person this is how you define a patriot Anyone can cheer heroes change our world This reminds me of the painting Liberty leading the peoplehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiLibertyLeadingthePeople by Delacroix Oh i want a poster sized print of that Solidarity What a bad ass That is happening in my country even in my city too Not gonna lie shes looking pretty fucking badass in this photo Thats the spirit fight for your rights even if the world around you is burning Yeah the situation in Poland is really fucked up From what I understand these abortion laws arent the only problem theres a huge atmosphere of borderline violent hatred towards LGBT folks minorities and generally anything that goes against traditionalist Catholic values or tradition in general Hell yes Im Polish and apart of the LGBTQ and this is the stuff I LIKE to see Im not sure how the mobilephone quality influences the decision but in terms of gravity this in my book is a frontrunner for the next PulitzerPeabody Okay just wanna say its sad the amount of homophobic transphobic and sexists comments being made in this comment section are Seriously you people need to educate yourself I assume this was the music playing in the backgroundhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgMYNfQlfH My friend lives in Poland and hes been telling me about all the stuff going down there Some images really are iconic Respect  Awesome I love her This looks like a cover of a movie and I really want to see it people have the right to shape their own life with their own choice wether if its right or wrongits their life not the govenments I was there There were thousands of people marching for freedom and around  nazis yeah nazists in Poland are pretty common the government gives them freedom how ironic had ran to us started using tear gas and throwing fireworks I got that gas in my eyes and had panic attack because of people running and screaming Wild shit Right now we are at th day of protesting Also police was there Hundreds of them But they were here to protect nazis Sees the low quality picture on a dimmed phone First reaction Why is that lady waving the First Republic of ChinahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBeiyanggovernment flag xB Lol it took me a second to notice it was the LGBT flag instead I guess Ive been playing too much Vicky as of late She looks badass This is one of those photos thatll be in a textbook someday raccidentalrenaissance Their bodies their choice The fact that this isnt common practice in the current year is sickening Unbelievably badass Well thats one for the history books Powerful Thats badass Its  and it still needs a lot of courage to raise the rainbow flag in may European countries Its such a badass photo that it looks like video game cover art Id grab that off the shelf and buy it instantly There stands history just taking names of all the people and noting which side of her they are on Its like the Soviets never left referring to the actions of the Polish government Not trying to be a dick But what does LGBT have to do with abortion ban protests Lesbians arent that well known for getting unwanted pregnancies The fact that people still have to have protests this violent for the simple right to love who they choose is mind boggling to me What does it matter to you who your neighbor loves so long as they are happy Edit aside from some very obvious areas pedophilia incest etc Edit I was corrected that the protest is about abortion I interpreted it as being about gay rights given the flag Love that woman Another example of humanitys never ending struggle to fend off the deeply rooted and primitive thinking of religion that leads to an invasive persecution that is still so prevalent in most cultures Just look around at the hateful posts here and you can see what religion gives to the wretched Legend Les Fabuleux Religion single most reason holding the world back its crazy that we still need to defend the right to abortion today Looks straight out like a character from an action movie lol Looks more like a photo shoot My niece helped me make this illustration of dystopia for a podcast episode about Hopepunk last year Im struck by how much this photo from Poland reminds me of the illustration httpsartistmaterialistcomephopepunkalightinthedystopiandarkness Chills literal chillshttpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsaaEugCAneDelacroixLalibertCAguidantlepeuplejpg So basically you just reposted this pic from rall without giving any credit httpswwwredditcomreuropecommentsjmhseqpolishwomenfightingfortheirrights And now everyone is giving awards and karma to a literal karmabot Give em hell Poland Ok thats a pretty cool picture I have a friend in Poland whom I stream with all the time Shes super freaked out right now about the current state of things From what Ive heard the current president outlawed abortion and is extremely homophobic Im not going to start any political banter by stating my opinion on abortion to avoid unnecessary conflict in the comments but his ideals and actions have started major protesting Im no religious person but may whomever is out there have mercy on Poland and its citizens Man this would be amazing if it was ultra hd La Rvolution Are they against the LGBT community over there When I saw this I was like but I thought Poland was chill Wow nice pic Do you hear the people sing When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow

ass fuck Epic fucking human Im polish the largest protest right now is in warsaw about  people I wish I could be as badass as her Protest or riot So hard to tell Ok that is a epic picture What is the significance of the rainbow flag Has it been adopted by a particular movement in Poland So proud of these sisters If I had the permission to travel to EU countries right now I would join their protest So tired of being told what is best for me BOSS Do that girl  be gay do crime Makes me feel proud to be of Polish heritage Also makes me want to fire up Sabaton What a badass This might go down as one of the greatest modern protest photos in the last decade I worked as an HRC representative for many years in manhattan heck even here i was getting coffee thrown at me and spit on god bless these people What a great fucking picture  GO MY POLISH SISTERS DISMANTLE YOUR HATEFUL GOVERNMENT Anyone else remember when rpics wasnt all political post deleted The gay flag is so pretty Red life and

constitution which in most countries is near impossible Iconic Thats the coolest shit Ive ever seen Do you hear the people sing Just waiting for some piece of shit to call her n Karen Damn thats hardcore When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes Poland has one of the best womens rights movements in the world Their streets are full of women and its also really safe for women to do almost anything But still they have women being beaten because they dressed too conservatively This looks like a  painting Battlefield  Looks like she just called in a supply box I dont understand why she is waving that flag Help me get this Isnt homosexuality still illegal in a few parts of Poland Gimmie a Kit Kat Im so tired of the world

IS there any reason to keep either canidates sign after the election I thought it was like Halloween decorations where your supposed to take it all down november st Or am I just over thinking this To be fair what else are you going to do with any of the election signs now Garbage day Shit man that trash shouldve been taken out  years ago Election is done I really really really hope we can go back to actual nice pics in this sub not just stuff about the election Everybody gangster untill we throw out the Biden sign Edit I know this is clich but thanks for the silver kind stranger and thank you for my first award Election Day passedboth Trump and Biden signs will be thrown out now House by mine has had HUGE MAGA and Trump flags and posters up on his house for months but when I ran by his house today while out on run they were all gone Yard was bare His flag pole was even void of any flags Gave me a smile and a burst of energy Honest question do people want Biden just bcuz they dont want trump anything other than Trump or do you guys really support the guy TIA Saw the same thing tonight in our Pittsburgh neighborhood httpsiimgurcomWwzRxjpg I mean the election is over wouldnt all signs now go in the garbage It would be kinda weird having a trump  sign whether he wins or losses Political yard signs should be banned Such needless waste Its just created trash Doesnt serve any purpose cant be reused Putting the Trumpster in the ol Dumpster Lol This reminds me of when I saw mitt romney signs in the trash on my way to school Oh god That thing went bad forever ago Thank god youre finally getting rid of it At least they disposed of it properly Here all the republican signs are just laying around because they dont even have the decency to collect them back after elections At least the Merch like shirts and Co might become handy as a cleaning cloth or such since it stays clean as no one is going to wear them Yea no reason to keep political yard signs past voting day really More of this please Yeah I have a feeling Trump branded items are going to be treated like nazi memorabilia in the annals of history Why are they throwing out their scariest Halloween decorations I have that same garbage can Oh the world we live in I see youve chosen to recycle rather than burn one mans trash is at least one mans treasure XD We call that a Trumpster Feel free to also use Trumpster Fire as well No put that shit back up live with your shame Dump Trump  Good riddance Ah perfect it found its way home Cathartic Imagine actually getting upset about a sign on someones lawn And that goes for both sides Couple of days ago some teenagers got shot because somebody had to protect his signs Now theyre trash America Fingers crossed As the Brits say off ya fuck I hate all the political signs just left on the side of the road They should be required to clean up all the signs they put up Private residences can stay however long obviously Right where it belongs Thank you for reminding me to put the trash out Most things look bad in the trash but this this looks good With neighbors like that every day is trash day I promised myself Id buy  Biden shirts in different colors if he won Im wearing them everyday if he does Each day a different color I live in a red stater so Ill really enjoy the conversations I just hope he wins I imagine when trump loses youll be taking that maga hat off that is something we cant oblige We like our magas in uniform A Rib a dar che Good move  years from now this will be the equivalent to Nazi memorabilia Every day is trash day if youre a Trump supporter How is this post not banned for political content Another high effort post from rpics Too bad they voted for him the day before I hate how this sub is just all political post like fuck chill out Wow a picture of a political sign in the trash Such quality posts on reddit Uh oh this post is trash too  Those type signs make excellent target holders and have a built in stand Ive had a stack of them in the shed just for target practice for like yrs they last forever unless you go crazy Soon they can take out the trash thats been in the White House Thats exactly where he belongs This has probably been the most hateful year Ive experienced With the most hateful American populace Ive ever seen Trump doesnt represent America but the image presented by everyone else is just as shitty and trashy This was the year that made me realize people are just bad in general No innate goodness thats a fuckin meme This isnt a political sub Hurrrr durrrr durrrr heres a picture of my trash can give me karma kthanxbye A new slogan for trump instead of make America great again how about TrumpPence Hold This L gArBaGe DayhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvigIpuIVEk This image is SO powerful hopefully they threw it away because of trump hostility towards democracy and legal votes Nice Sir Sean died peacefully in his sleep while in the Bahamas having been unwell for some time his son said His acting career spanned five decades and he won an Oscar in  for his role in The Untouchables Sir Seans other films included The Hunt for Red October Highlander Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock Jason Connery said his father had many of his family who could be in the Bahamas around him when he died overnight in Nassau He said We are all working at understanding this huge event as it only happened so recently even though my dad has been unwell for some time Some more info RIP The knighthood I received was a fantastic honour but its not something Ive ever used and I dont think I ever will  Sean Connery This is a Highlander deleted scene just before she lops his head off In this picture you can see the queen yet again stealing the life force out of another unsuspecting subject FYI his mother was a MacLean so that is The tartan he is wearing rshubreddit was always a great source of all things connery He will be sorely missed but his enormous legacy goes on Fun fact  Sean Connery once beat up four men singlehandedly for giving some girls a hard time in a club while Michael Caine held his coat What a guy RIP Sean Connery Ill take anal bum cover for one thousand Alex Trebec Thats an album cover Did you hear about those warriors from England Theyve got curved swords Curved Swords My dumbass reaction was that she looked much younger there Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far in life A book landed on Sean Connereys head What did he say I can only blame my shelf As expected this thread is  Fuck you karma whores  Fuck Sean Connery died RIP  Fuck the queen  Fuck Sean Connery he objectified women The best part about Reddit theres some Fuckery for everyone Suck it Trebek My dad loved Sean Connery I remember watching Mr Connerys Bond movies growing up Then loving the Rock Last Crusade and a few others I always think of my dad when I watch these movies RIP to a legend Yknow seeing this image and thinking  was  years ago is wild to me Does he get more money being a knight  The Man Who Would Be King The first movie that made me truly cry It affected me so much that I now feel this piece of me and memory is emptier knowing hes gone I never understood being sad for the passing of someone you dont know personally but now I realize that these people share moments with you that change you forever Its a mark of a true artist RIP Sir Sean Connery and thank you for everything As a fellow Sir this saddens me  Being knighted has got to be one of the coolest things that can happen to you in the twenty first century removed Rip the legend you were the best man A Schword over me shouldersh Tonight your mother will be screaming yes SIR Trebek Do you guys think well ever see a day when people dont karmawhore someone famous death Can  just end I wouldnt be surprised if an asteroid hit on New Years Eve Did he slap her afterwards LET THE KARMA WHORING BEGIN Good thing he only condoned slapping women with an opened hand and not a clenched fist httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmzXkbJwrN Brace yourselves for the million Sean Connery posts Dear Sean you were my hero and the best looking man in my younger days I am very sad  Absolutely butchering the commentary in the US right now She hasnt aged a day Well buckfutter RIP Sir Sean Connery May your legend ring eternal Here endeth the lesson RIP And so Reddit users continue the tradition of frantically googling a picture of recently dead celebrity as fast as they can race to any tangentially appropriate subreddit and pray to Keanu Chungus that no one has beaten them to the punch so they can be the ones to get that gold and karma Untouchables only Oscar that is a shame  were great roles  Just year before he gave great speech about Scottish independence from UK How old is the Queen again Amen May he rest in peace Let it be known that he wanted it shaken and not stirred  In Scotland no less rest in peace sean connery Finding Forrester  one of my favorites of his works Loved Sean EPIC Total badass RIP Sir Sean Connery Sean Connery was the best James Bond RIP In the name of the warrior I charge you to be brave In the name of the father I charge you to be just In the name of the mother I charge you to defend the innocent Arise Sean Connery a knight of the seven koh wait wrong show  And I thought George Lazenby was the only Bond to wear a kilt deleted Legends never die Thank you for being with us for so long I always thought of Sean Connery like Betty White Could never imagine him dying  just gets worse and worse as the months pass RIP Sir Sean Its humbling how he managed to live a quiet retirement and stay out of the limelight Another Legend and Film Icon Gone Im actually very sad Loved his accent and the gleam in his eyes Love you so much Sean You were the best Will miss you so much Thank you for everything God Bless you Rest in Peace sir I dont think there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman although I dont recommend doing it in the same way that youd hit a man An openhanded slap is justified if all other alternatives fail  Sean Connery Playboy  Look at the size of that sporran Most people have a full measure of life and most people just watch it slowly drip away But if you can summon it all up at one time in one place you can accomplish something glorious Drink a martini shoot a PPK in the air slap an uppity female httpsyoutubepWXYktmrE What a fkn boss God speed you glorious son of a bitch What an incredible honor that must have been for the queen If I was him I would have been terrified about accidentally flashing Liz when kneeling down in that kilt What are the benefits of being knighted Rest In Peace sir thank you for everything Connery Sir Sean Connery Absolutely one of my favorite actors and of course the best Bond of all time The world lost a great talented person I love Sean Connery cant wait to see him in the new Bond I wonder if he ever had to slap her Weak Shouldnt bow or kneel to the monarch End That shit dont bow or kneel Wonder if this woulda been an appropriate time to shlap a woman Wife beaters shouldnt be knighted and then I shmacked her the mouth to let her know her place Quick A celebrity diedeveryone post a picture of them resht in peashe Was he not a separatist Or at least had those leanings Karma being knighted by Reddit Rest In Peace you glorious Scott While wearing a kilt Legend Ironic since the man thought women were basically objects What a true gentleman and legend This world just lost another icon Sir Sean Connery May you find your ever lasting peace RIP When is Sean Connerys match at Wimbledon ish May he rest in peace Rip Sean I was only your bloody spy for  yearsmum RIP One of the greatest actors ever RIP Sir Connery I never understood why they knight actors all the time Is this from Highlander extended edition looking at this pic makes me think she was tempted to cut off his head because THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE What does being knighted in this day and age mean RIP Sir An iconic photo RIP Dew it Anakin He was me and sons name sake Mine is Sean and my sons Conner middle name E RIP My coworker last night said to not be surprised if Sean Connery dies soon Gotta say Im pretty surprised he can speak thing into existence Woulda been a better pic if he had dawned his Zardoz gear I remember that Bond had to fight the queens doppelgnger This is the scene where she almost sliced his head off Bond used his skirt gadget to flashbang her There can be only one And the fucking queen still alive Damn  Can I be knighted No Sir Connery I expect you to Rest In Peace Oh wow I didnt know How tragic Sean is one of those men women cant help but swoon for RIP Holy shit the queen looked old  years ago For some reason I read kidnapped and now I kinda wish that wouldve happened A celebrity dies Reddit time to farm some sweetkarma rpics time to milk this dead person for sweet karma That sword looks like a cheap Toy sword from Walmart Why is it bended Being raised a Catholic with all our formal ceremony and such the knighting ceremony just seems so familiar in that regard Like its born from religious rite Now imagine if a real hardened knighted sir from medieval times saw this Nobody did it better I feel like a knighting would have been more interesting when there was a realistic risk of actually having ones head lopped off rdeadpersonkarma many good memories Interesting note about heraldry and knighthoods Sean Connery stop being a Sir when he died Knighthoods are all living orders which means that they only exist as long as the person is alive As soon as they die they order dies with them The exception to this is members of the clergy This was the source of much consternation when the revelation about Jimmy Savile came out  People demanded that he be stripped of his knighthood not knowing that his knighthood was no lonter in existance True fact after being knighted most people in attendance had severe electrical shock after he did The Quickening To be fair he did say There can only be one So they had fair warning The queen doesnt look a day older than eternity You shure this is  BC RIP Do people who get knighted now have the right to carry a sword Do they wear armour sometimes Do they serve the queen and carry out her objectives There can only be one Love the kilt Thats my man Its more like the queen was stealing his life force Were the man now dog Fuck off what He died Man this was not the information I was wanting to wake up to  There can be only one The only ceremony where the double was attending WOW HE DIED Ohmygosh Rest in peace Its rare that the death of a celebrity makes me really sad Philip Seymour Hoffmans passing did that and Robin Williams death also And this one might be the worst yet Wasnt the queen  in this picture Sean Connery died let hope that his skirt doesn t blow over Some how not even one fcking happy looking face in the whole pic Edit found a cpl in the back after I posted  but still  there can be only one Wow So he was  there Life is so short RIP FCK  The Penis Mightier The source of this is annaulman on Instagram NSFW who actually is the OP Per

Councillors daughter dressed as him for Halloween Was that so hard The title gore is real but what an adorable pic and sentiment  POP POP She nailed the pose I want to love this post but the title gave me diarrhea She looks more like him then he does She looks so proud of herself a picture is worth  words and your title is worth shit Ive never read a more simple and concise and easily legible title in my life Getting some Bobs Burgers vibes Godzilla had a stroke trying to read this and fucking died This is Halifax eh Shes got his expression down cold Reminds me of that episode of Bobs Burger with Bob and GeneBob What What are they going as I need an adult That city councillor is tiny Hey This is my councillor Happy to report he just won reelection by a landslide  What rtitlegore That hurt to read Damn shes tall Great costume Diabolical title That title has given me a migrain Spot on Ok thats insanely adorable He has his own mini me I saw this on HalifaxNoise Hello fellow haligonian  its always nice to see us on the front page well sometimes its nice Yay Halifax Alternative Title The City counselors daughter dressed up as him for Halloween The City counselor did not dress up I dig your councilman I do not dig your diction man Tiny Riiiiick This is so cute omfg POP POP That little girl looks like middle school chemistry teacher I regret for reading it Thank you I had a stroke reading this I love that your city Councillor is young and has cornrows It says a lot about how accepting your people are Is this OPs first day using words I thought it was trick photo until I read the title Awesome I know Lindell he is one of the kindest and honorable men Title gore or not we need more people like him in politics Nailed the costume too I shall call him mini me Adorable For a short moment I thought they were both dressed up as magnitude from community Shes tall My brain could not wrap around that title for like  whole minutes at least the picture is great though good for them Oh come on stop complaining about the title guys you all got what op was trying to say POP POP Title is the scariest thing Ive seen this Halloween Her dressed city councillor as Her him be dress Him daughter her be as him dressed Aaah city man dress councillor daughter be as his dress be Now understand be me do Thats so damn cute Which is which  vs ft Spelling is hard Thats the worst title Ive ever read Man this whole comment thread is shitting on the title but not one person is acknowledging this is girl that looks to be about  and is over here convincingly looking like a straight up grown ass man I had to read that title  times before realising the poster is mentally deficient Combined with OCD Every grammar nazis out here is having a malfunction Pop Pop  This title has put me in a paradox of confusion Ive read that title  times and I still have no idea what it means This is like the Bobs Burgers thing What kind of title is this Wtf does that title even mean I dont know him or her But Her looks exactly how I imagined Him to look before I saw neither of them Godzilla had a stroke reading this and fucking died I think OP had a stroke while writing that title Im seeing double four councilors Is it so difficult to write a simple title like wtf Our city councilor went as himself for Halloween and so did his daughter There fixed your awful title Which ones the daughter Title reminds me of that Blur song Girls and BoyshttpsyoutubeWDswiToolistPLWThUPVkhyLjpMiAsuPcKiDbArA Lyrics Girls who want boys Who like boys to be girls Who do boys like theyre girls Who do girls like theyre boys Always should be someone you really love Thats probably the coolest city councillor In the world She looks more like him than him i thougt it was a splited image The city councillor and his daughter dressed up he as himself and she as him rihadastroke Im more inclined to think that title is what peak grammar looks like Thats a work of art there and not because its difficult to parse but precisely because it forces you to rewire your brain and muster up all the power of your focus in order to appreciate the beauty of its simplicity So this Councilor and his daughter THEY went as him and SHE WENT dressed as him If you rewrite it like this it might look more pedantic but also very dull clunky and lifeless while the OPs version is dynamic concise the need for burdensome punctuation is removed its simply more poetic The OP should be a modernist writer Pop pop POP POP I swear I only read titles like this when Im high The word himself could have saved many lives This title gave me stage  cancer I had zero trouble understanding the title of the post Not sure why its so confusing Anyway thats an amazing costume and I wish my local government were half as fun and relatable pop pop Pop pop So him her is him and dressed as ok Daughter is loving giving that face back to him Great costumes I am a sucker for posts like this you can tell that her

though Which is them What an awful title but the worst part is the username Infuriating that they will never learn how to fix this Pop pop Pop Pop Title so fucked this should be tagged NSFW let me fix your title for you Our city councilor and his daughter she dressed up as him and he dressed up as a someone who thinks it is acceptable to wear camo pants as an adult I wonder if this super dad and his super daughter would have become so popular if I hadnt screwed the title so badly Thanks everyone who liked this and gave so many kind comments and awards Yes my title is terrible I did it on the fly and thats what I get So Im unclear on whether I can say who the councillor is would that be doxxing Some others have said his name and we are Halifax Nova Scotia Canada I dont know the girls name Very cool rtitlegore What Bro he looks no older than   I like that coat Which ones her what a fucking ego i know ill go as me and you go as me too who the fuck is he anyway His hands seem comically

This guy looks great for  OG looking fresh wouldnt have guess his age by this picture alone Salut Are you the Bill Gates impersonator from Nathan For You Upvoted because king county Also because awesome grandpa To me the most interesting part is the regional selection of languages on the box Its cool how different this country can be within itself WAWAWEEWA WA for washington addendum BYEDON I dropped off my ballot at that exact same drop box last Friday Not  but another lifelong republican voting blue in King County too Congrats to him Some people dont understand you can be a republican and vote against the orange Donald is not republican He supported the Clintons and then ran against themher as if he was a lifelong rival He isnt into democracy and doesnt uphold any values of either republican or democrat Whys he look like hes about to beat my ass This geezer is hitting the hardest woah of all time He voted for Trump and doesnt use social media He will never see this Reddit moment Imagine the comments if OP said he voted for trump The man is  and still goes out to vote What is your excuse And a full head of hair God Bless him One side note the voting process looks chill af You should see how voting booths in india arecrazy EVMs and long lines Oh yeah The thing about a political party is this You can identify as a Republican Democrat or whateverand be completely disgusted with the President and things your party has done ie Im a Republican who wants a better Republican party than this current administration Push for a newer better party with newer better peopleand definitely vote for a different partys candidate if it means a better country Case in point The dude in the photo To clarify because this is Reddit Im an Independent I think the American twoparty system dominance is a horrific joke The picture could be any old man standing by a ballot box People are upvoting the title So brave for an American to vote Waddup fam thought that looked like Uncle Bill As grand as this is I believe it sheds light on a problem we have as voters Maybe if we vote based on the individuals goals for their candidacy instead of voting because thats what political party they belong to then maybe we wouldnt be in this mess It gives me great joy to see the older generation change their views party I applaud this individual Edit  Because cosworth said it right rpics is randomly removing voting photos due to a temporary ban on politics My  year old grandfather did this as well A few days after he mailed in his ballot he got covid Just waiting for the call at this point to hear news of him passing on but Im still so proud he voted blue So that means he was fine with voting for a guy who lied to congress and the UN in order to get into a pointless war for oil and Voting for the guy who started the entire crack epidemic to fund death squads and casually ignored the CDC to ignore a plague just because it was killing gay people Do I have that right So now that someone tweets a lot then he suddenly realizes that the Republicans are bad Hes  and Im in my early s I have the same shoes hes wearing That old guy is HIP The same things happened with my grandmother she was a diehard republican until Obama Why why why is this in pics Posting that he voted is fine but why alienate people by saying who he voted for If the caption said he was voting for Trump this would be taken down lmao  Democrat who just voted for Biden damn he look fantastic at  This is my County Hope no one used the urinal electoral Go grampa Thats what Im talking about Also his hair is A homie has great genes Im picturing him saying bag em n tag em He probably wrote in Ross Perot haha So proud of you Country over party secretly votes for trump The guy has aged well This post not so much  Who cares Should have just left it at  year old man making his vote count instead of bringing politics in a pictures sub Your not the only one ByeDon indeed Yesssss  year old lifelong republican uncle did the same this year Thanks dudes BS karma grab Should probably be wearing a mask Im a lifelong Republican of  years and today I voted Biden see how easy it is to lie Cringe thanks pop  years too late but thanks He looks like hes ready to throw a flurry I met a  year old democrat in line who said if Im too old for too drive the biden is too old to serve and voted trump Best thing ever Wtg daddy o Isnt this considered political karmawhoring Reported Why is this  on my front page People change who they vote for all the time Lol redditso petty He must have voted for Lincoln His stance reminds me of a baseball umpire throwing the hammer to call someone out at the plate How symbolic Dude looks like Jimmy Carter Are those Merrell shoes hes wearing Im wearing a pair of Merrells right now and wondered why I didnt switch sooner this just in republican votes for someone who believes all the same things as him Damn I hope Im that spry at  Edit Hell I hope I make it to  Somehow Electoral Urn seems appropriate Awe So heartwarming  Reddit Dems Hehe yeah boi thats the spirit He looks hella good for  Good on him Let Byedons be Byedons Wow A sane man I dont understand why these Republicans cant just say Fuck this assbag and his childish games getting people killed Biden is practically a Republican anyway and will lead better Dude looks like an older

Seattle WA not a battleground state bravo nonetheless The bias against trump in this subreddit is pretty strong lmfao Always great to be faithful to the people and not a party A Republican in King County Thats a brave man A lifelong republican from king county wa Cheers to him and his sly dimples you thought he was gonna get away with by sharing this pic Jealous Im a  yr old libertarian leaning left that flipped this election Sorry old chap I guess we cancel each other out BYE DON When the dementia hits I love the ballot drop box in five languages The most beautiful thing about the US with or without Trump My wifes parents are about that age  years younger and have always voted republican Not this time they arent My grandparents were lifelong republicans but they started voting democrat after they died  bucks says he lied to his grandkid who took the picture because he knows whats best for the country and knows how to fight bullies Anyone who is lifelong anything is not rational and their decisions cant be trusted Keep your politics in the politics sub I know my tendency is to downplay these oh its isolated But the truth is Im  and this shit is unheard of People dont change party because of one guy and even when they do they dont vote against the party like this they go Libertarian or something Lookin good What made him change his mind about voting republican Bye den Trumps gonna win again lol Seattle represent I still havent figured out why any real republican would support Trump or Mitch So sad Poor man has dementia Thank you for putting country and decency above personal pride Makes me extremely optimistic that there are people who are open minded enough to vote across parties Well done Sir  and he looks x better than Sleepy Joe Something happened to Biden since  I think he had a stroke because his mental decline is rather apparent Trump  Excellent sir Well done How to get Reddit upvotes ebook Orange man bad I am no longer voting red I see them hiking boots  this guy walks Thank you Sir Looks like he could drop Chump in one swing Captain America style Fun thought  If hes a  year old Republican then we was most definitely against integration Big shift in ideologies if he didnt vote Republican That dementia is something shouldnt of wasted that vote when he could of voted gold He is dressed to a T like my grandfather I miss him so and this was so lovely to see Thank you What if he had a friend named Don who wanted to vote for trump so he said Bye Don Ill vote for Trump for you or something that would be touching Thung phieu kind stranger Damn He must have been around when the Republican Party actually did good things Soon we will say bye to his old ass In the grave Trump  Is the title true I hope so or is op fishing for karma Lifelong Republican voting Republican Lets go  Yeah hes going with the guy that fought AGINST integration and fought to massively incarcerate minorities Like they used to in the good old days Oh yeah his vote really counting against the President in Washington Thats a weird section of languages Chinese Spanish Korean and Vietnamese I guess its tailored to the ethnicity of the areas immigrants Good for him walkaway has more who went the other direction TRUMP  Cringe Must have gone senile Oh look another post with Trump Derangement Syndrome on pics color me shocked  Might wanna sit him down before telling him the results Why do people always celebrate old people voting Arent the older generations against all the changes that the new generations are trying to introduce Well done sir Well done amazing he looks in much better shape than  too Yay thanks for voting I am  and his hair still looks better than mine Lol Thats a bummer If he should have learned anything in his  yrs Neither party is going to really help you For me my old mom and my children thank you Lame Sad he voted for the guy that attempted to block African American children from public education  years of racial division history on Bidens ballot just gone the moment he wanted to be president  year old lifelong republican who said the same thing today Im aware of the influence Chinese has in east Asia but it still surprised me a little to see the Vietnamese and Korean are basically the same transliterated Chinese words here And the Chinese text went with the more fancy version lol My grandma who is a lifelong Republican voted for ByeDon too Delusional So he voted for Nixon Reagan Bush What a cunt Let ByeDons be ByeDons whatdya say no worries first time voter here my first republican vote will cancel out his first democratic vote Trump  Hes ready to deliver that one two lets do it THATS MY HOME Washington represent Good for him And hopefully good for america Just wish that was King County Texas or King County Florida where it could make a bigger difference Sure the optics of Trump losing by like  or even  million votes this time are great but a loss in either TX or FL ends his reelection and makes it very hard for him to steal it using Pennsylvania FYI  King County Georgia is the fictional location of part of The Walking Dead TIL Im sure a whole lot of folks younger than that made the party switch between the civil war and the s Must have been a wild time for people that dont like change Thank you sir Heck yeah king county voting Love to see it He looks like that pointing meme

pure beautiful I wish we would celebrate this in the US instead of Halloween Its so much more relevant and actually means something Se dice Da de muertos Da de los muertos is a Disney trademark  Feliz da de los muertos to everyone except Ernesto de La Cruz Is this the festival from the movie CoCo As a white dude Dia de los Muertos is probably my favorite tradition from another culture The meaning behind it is great and the aesthetic is just amazing Beautiful makeup Really well done But I need to make one correction Da de Muertos No los Im so confused that everyone is this thread is saying da de los Muertos even OP from DF district federal aka mexico city Its an artifact from being translated from Spanish to English then back to Spanish But it is just Da de Muertos Its the name of a holiday so it is a bit more than symantecs Da de Muertos translated to day of dead That doesnt work in English so we say Day of the dead  which is perfectly acceptable but then its translated back to Spanish as Da de los Muertos  which is now incorrect You do some great work That is so awesome Love the colors and everything Guapsima Felicidades desde Espaa Dayum de los Muertos You are beautiful

climbed walked up it and still have the walking sticks with the burnt on stamps Growing up in Japan was cool Credit to the photographer Thanai Manasathithttpswwwjmsphtcom aka Jaamess Photohttpswwwjmsphtcom and jmspht on Instagram Per the Instagram source  Throw back in February  when I Graduated from College in Japan my parents went to my graduation ceremony  And then we have a trip to Mount Fuji First time when I was in Japan was  years old and it has been  years already Time fly right  I cant wait to be back to Japan again  July   HerehttpswwwgooglecommapsayhtdatamemsPzcKxRoMvjCFvFNJAesTiihlen this is via Google Street View Ive always wanted to climb Mt Fuji in the winter My Japanese friends say that only stupid foreigners want to climb Mt Fuji in the winter Im not arguing Its snowing on mount fuji Ive never seen a photo of it that wasnt a long shot This is amazing Thank you Japan is so aesthetically pleasing Chris Broad You sonuvabitch We must take the pass of Caradhras I worked with Tokyo Electron close to this majestic mountain While in the mens room they had a window overlooking this beauty Best piss I ever took Wonderful country to visit Climbed Fuji thought it would be a nice hike It was just walking on rocks at a steep incline for many hours Then it started to rain Probably should have done my research but was with a group and assumed they had Negative we were all just college kids YOLOing it Edit to clarify it was really awesome and one of my favorite memories from my time in Japan But I had zero idea what I was in for Thank God I wore comfortable shoes HerehttpswwwgooglecommapsayhtdatamemsZkSddBJHQNrLymPUiFpPQeii is the Google Maps streetview looking toward Fuji from this exact location Cloudy so nothing can be seen HerehttpswwwgooglecommapsayhtdatamemshfKdUNKaBDLREVIMgsAesTii is the same location in Aug  where you can see Fuji And herehttpswwwgooglecommapsayhtdatamemsKAjVJSARkNpwFMOibftwesTii it is in Dec  where you can see snow This is not the actual size of Mt Fuji from this location But a blend of a close up shot and long focal length of a road leading to Mt Fuji I saw the actual photo the other day on Reddit and I was still epic but this is not quite reality Its snowing on Mount Fuji When was the last time Fuji erupted rClutteredYetTidy thats a real mountain Id love to visit China some day Its like Majoras Mask but with a mountain instead of a moon Oooooh so nice Fujisan  Whats up with Japan with their overhead wires Put the wiring underground I mean come on man Beautiful or scary not sure which one It looks like it could collapse onto the town Holy shit its as tall as a mountain Dont show that to Chris Broad Its snowing on Mount Fuji I so want go back to Japan Fuck Corona and all those fucking travel restrictions Anyone else down to quit their day job and travel the world I miss Japan It was honestly one of the best trips of my life and two weeks was not even a scratch close to enough time The people the foodoh my god the food the culture and history there is just so damn much to take in I like how all the signs have tiny Mt Fujis in them Like yeah Whats the name of this town I wanna look it up in Maps I gotta get back to Japan I frickin love japan Japan is such a gorgeous country When I was in the USMC we were at Camp Fuji somewhere near the bottom of the mountain it was still a ways away One day I remember it well as I THINK it was OCtober or September st or whatever they asked us if we wanted to hike to the top I said yes as did a bunch of guys from my unit I remember it was the LAST day of the year the mountain was open to hikers So my dumbass wore a goretex pants and a tight white tshirt and some gloves We thought it would be fun to run to the top and go ahead of everyone else walking up so we did me and like  people ran like hell the entire way The thing I should note was that we THOUGHT there would be camps open on the way up we could stop and get coffee and snacks etc but being the last day only the base camp was open So we ran like hell to get to the top thinking we could then turn around and go down but when we got to the top not only was the store for coffee and snacks not open but the assholes in the USMC said we had to wait at the top before going down so they could take roll I only had a fucking Tshirt on and I was drenched in sweat Worst day ever I thought I might die Anyways the run down was fucking awesome bc it was on the other side of the mountain with these curvey trails that were all lava rock we went STRAIGHT down instead of on the trails so you could jump as far out as you could and drop like  feet into the loose lava rock to pad your fall and just do that over and over it was awesome We made it down that mountain in literally  minutes it seemed Crazy day Its even better when you realise Fuji is a deadly volcano and if it erupts EVERYONE DIES I love free food LOL what city in Japan is this Is Mount Fuji like Lauren Hill but taller and more pointy They should do away with the power lines and light poles What a shame Always something looking over your shoulder Creepy I want to eat ramen here Thats really cool Unbelievable Scaling this is on my bucket list Thank you for sharing Awesome photo OMG I love how you used the power lines For those who enjoy Asian Beauty products all we can see is SKII Cleansers yaaaassss MMMmmm  fresh powder Yeah this picture is taken with an enormous zoomlens though Which part of the town is this Would love to take a visit to be in awe of this magnificent view I could jump that with a skateboard Dont want to be around when that thing goes I got to climb that last year Started off with about  people at the bottom racer our butts up there and there only three of us left Reminds me a bit of Canmore Alberta Surrounded by the Rockies Not as impressive as this shot though You know the mountain is tall when everything at its base are mere specks Concerned citizen Its too dangerous out on the streets Someone should do something City planner I meanI guess we could go with ft spacing on the street lamps This is what Im here for Bloody hell thats massive so cewl I thought Fuji City at first as the mountain looks very bumpy Googling the street signs though seems to be Fuji Yoshida Really dont remember it being so active there This is how normal objects feel when I experience Alice in wonderland episodes Am I the only seeing faces in the snow Or do I have an issue But if youre Chris Broad itll be foggy asf Pokmon champion Red is waiting at the top Hope Chris sees it this time I want to live there It looks so massive and yet like a baby mountain all at the same time WOW Isnt there a movie about this Beautiful Wow i like how u get a clear view but Chris Broad cant get a clear view of fuji for the life of him Gotemba is nowhere near that close Hike that motherfucker once before you die Go in the spring or fall and you can basically have it to yourself Dont go in the winter  too hard and quite dangerous Mountain spotting eh It looks like its walking down the street This looks to good to be true I need to visit I had no idea Japanese drive English reverse style Gorgeous view What a great shot Imagine this being an everyday thing amazing Reminds me of Ushuaia in Argentina Thats a lot of streetlights Wheres a red balloon for a kid with a red hoodie What town Is the elevation of the town  feet make this a wallpaper That is absolutely beautiful Props to the photographer for this amazing shot Majestic Left side of road traffic TIL about Japan Climbed Fuji BC before Covid in flip flops Sea to summit  hours of fun Damn Imagine waking up to this view every day Is it snowing Incredible Its snowing on mount fuji How does Japan make power lines look aesthetically pleasing In my country they make everything ugly Anyone got a link to a high rez version This photo is amazing and I want it to be my background Am I the only one who sees a face looking straight at me What city is this Looks beautful Thats a great view Oh wow oh wow this is beautiful Jeez how much would it cost to put those wires underground removed Someone post that nearby town seen from the top of Mt Fuji On a tele lens so the background looks much larger than it actually is Yup Good thing they didnt mar the view with a bedlam of urban infrastructure Future Pompeii right there I love Japan I see a face top left between the power lines Looks like Davy Jones from POTC Great Shot greatly applied Perspective Distortion Beautiful mount town nearby Word checks out This looks like a still from an anime Awesome shot Jeeezus when that flank gives way Mount St Helenesque everyone will freeze and be like what was that did you feel that And WHOOOOSH GONE in a flash of pyroclastic instant Wonderful image but scares the  outta me knowing that is an active volcano and well if it exploded or even any event that image makes it look awesome and terrifying I would like to wake up thereand jerk off the to the morning wood I thought this was a Still from a Miyazaki film I been to Fuji a handful of times and every single one of them it was breathtaking So nice Looks like its from an anime Wow Never seen it from this perspective Took a long time to convince myself this wasnt a painting Gotemba Listened to a myths and legends podcast that told a story about mt fuiji  moonlight ep  HIGHLY RECCOMEND its about a princess and the emperor Google maps tells another story This has clearly tons of photo manipulating tricks in it It looks like its gonna fal over any minute Nice drawing man  Very cool thank you Tfw Japan looks like anime AESTHETIC Absolutely beautiful Can someone who is fluent in Japanese tell me what  means in this content Google says it means Really which I doubt is the case I dearly hope Ill never have to land a parachute in that road Wonder if Yoshimitsu has been to this town Nice shot Imagine waking up to that every day jealous sigh This must be some super cool camera setting or shit like that There must be other pictures like this where it looks completely different does anyone have some Where r the hokages faces I really love the way the lamp posts telephone poles and cabling are like an extension of the katakana and hiragana lettering Oh shit get out of there man Fujisan May have not been the exact town I visited but very possible Some of the freshest air and most outstanding people there Went three times worth every damn cent its a giant mountain of spider webs good night  This is beautiful but I have watched too many movies and the first thing that came to mind was an avalanche waiting to happen Went to go visit the area last year before the world turned upside down Its gorgeous over there We were staying in Hakone and they had just gotten over the Typhoon so a lot of the local transportation was down When we got there we realized there was no bus route going in the vicinity of where we were staying and we had no idea how to get a taxi so me and my wife had to walk with our bags for close to  miles on a  degree incline for most of it Im not a hiker that was brutal Bad place to go climbing I hear I remember one climber going up and by the time he came down  major Japanese cities were engulfed in nuclear fire Not to discount all the ones burned with regular fire which worked surprisingly well what town is this I want to live here Damn and I thought Rainier seemed ominous in Seattle Wow its beautiful It looks like its going to run you over So ominous I love this Wow fantastic picture I want to download this Where can I get full res httpsuniversityallworldblogspotcomexplorenepalhtmlhttpsuniversityallworldblogspotcomexplorenepalhtml Chris Abroad in Japan is gonna be mad Anyone else see the face on it Big fooj Ive got an idea lets build a town right at te base of a giant volcano what could go wrong Uh something something Pompeii No credit to OP Ok urepostsleuthbot Oh for crying out loud does it really matter if its angle focus short lens longer than you     lens or if an alien came over after probing the Pope and gave you the perfect Nikon camera from Mars this is a fking awesome and scary as shit picture Lol I dont know what looks more amazing the street or the mountain  Why do I hear boss music This has been posted here so many times Im surprised the color isnt fading  I hope to see this with my own eyes one day Thats majestic as fuck Those wires though  Breathtaking I want to go there The fuck you mean this isnt a painting Is this a repost cause Ive seen the picture several times I hate powerlines What does  mean Que foto maravilhosa Fugirama Theres a fair gale on up the top Fuji smug Jezus this gives me flashbacks to when I went to Japan Its such a beautiful country These wires make me feel trapped What a shame I would be leaving Got Electric I climbed Mt Fuji  yrs ago by myself Started pm and got back down am Soaked and miserable and so so happy l I will climb again when the world opens back Amazing photo when i scrolled down to this my brain zoomed in on the mountain with a parallaxdolly shot effect Japan is one of the most photogenic places I have ever visited You can literally point a camera down any streetalley at any time of day and capture something beautiful Theres something special about living that close to a mountain Id love to retire somewhere like that What town is this Shameless Karmawhoring httpswwwredditcomrjapanpicscommentsjighttpswwwredditcomrjapanpicscommentsjigfbmountfujifbmountfujihttpswwwredditcomrjapanpicscommentsjigfbmountfuji This is the where the pic was originally discovered SHAMELESS Thats so cool What does  mean Honestly thats the one mountain Id never mess around with Its a dormant volcano that supposedly had an immortality elixir poured into it Can you imagine what would happen if an immortal volcano decides to erupt and just you know never stop Mount Fuji isnt beautiful or serene Mount Fuji is terrifying Glorious Where is a high res file of this Id love a poster of this on my wall rconfusingperspective I look at this and all I can think is please bury the phone and power lines Awesome pic  I feel like Rodan gonna bust outta there lol Is it a long hike to the top Japan is such a picturesque country Just wow Someone make this in Animal Crossing  OMGGGG I have been to kawaguchi This looked unfamiliar or I just didnt appreciate it while I was there Somewhere on Fuji a skier sneezed dooming the city below Zoomed in all the way from tokyo Pink Floyd  Live at Fuji Chris Broad would love this Wow It looks like its covered in a fine lace veil Why does Japan keep a electrical infrastructure from the s Not even Hicksville USA has that much hanging wires Always find myself asking what locals do to live in such places I say it must be amazing to live there Then i think of locals who only live there to take care of those who come to visit it This looks like the Fujiyoshida area near the Kawaguchiko station Is that it I used to live in Japan first for school and then an number of years for work and in that time frame I climbed this mountain a total of  times twice successfully to the top It is a very challenging hike especially if you do it right Attack it from the first station bring a tent and hike through the night Nap at the th station for an hour or two and then make a push for the summit by sunrise If youre not a hiker its still worth taking a bus to the th station and wandering around on the mountain side The air at that altitude is so fresh its almost sweet Then you can take the bus back to the Ryokan inn and sit in an onsen bath in your birthday suit while staring out at that massive peak That whole area is a little piece of heaven Honesty thought this was from an Evangelion film pretty Does anyone else see the tired face with weird eyes Ummm holy shit Gorgeous Whats the actual distance from this spot to the base of mt fuji   So beautiful yet prone to a movie apocalypse Ghoulish greetings rpics patron Have you heard about our spooktacular Halloween Photo Contesthttpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsjbgtgyenterthepicshalloweenphotocontest I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorpics if you have any questions or concerns The way that woman holds her pistol always makes me laugh switches to controversial Oh man these comments are gonna be fun Oh damn they even went for the white face Look fellas there is quite a debate going on  one side says its racist for this woman to whiten her face in order to mock a white woman which is racist because black face is deemed to be racist and it is the equivalent  the other side says that whiteface is not racist because it lacks the historical background of excessive use for derogatory purposes like blackface The reason why this is such a back and forth debate is because well both sides are right This is whiteface it is meant to mock another race but whiteface just doesnt carry the same weight as blackface due to a lack of history with it Before I get into it Im black and I grew up in the dirt poor black community of the Bronx so nobody hit me with the you dont understand racism card Now regardless one cannot deny the double standards with blackface being wrong but whiteface being okay If someone did yellow face for an asian person costume then there would be no argument Its only because theyre mocking white people that it is okay in some peoples eyes I imagine thats how some people felt about black face back in the day that it was okay because theyre mocking black people The truth is you cant say its okay to color yourself in a certain manner to mock one race but not another Regardless of the history Want to know why For one thing thats discriminatory the other reason is because history repeats itself If you allow one race to be the subject of racist behavior and say its okay because its not racist when concerning said race youre setting the society up for another racist era Dont compensate for past racism with more racism Trump Hicks are going to see something like this see the comments where people are all saying this isnt racist because theyre mocking white people not black people and theyre going to get pissed and start doing blackface out of spite Thats why you cant have these double standards Ive seen a few of these now and my only complaint is that none of the women are adding mustard stains to their shirts They already posted this here a bunch yesterday you literally just took their pics and rearranged them to repost Wheres the mustard stain She forgot to add the mustard stain The costume is funny Ill say that lol I just feel a bit conflicted about the womans Makeup What I really need is context to the original photo Wtf is going on here Is that white face Is that allowed in  now He needs to randomly point the gun at his wife Why does she kinda look like oprah tho I mean did they have to do whiteface Like the costume Racism goes both ways though painting your face white with the intent to mimic a white person isnt very appropriate   No hate speech or incivility  Any statements of bigotry hate andor racism are not allowed We are a strictly antibigotry sub  I guess mods are selective here also Please dont get shot that blond wigs not gonna help but its okay for white face  coulda done the costume without that I love the Dave Chapelle white face Good job but I would stay on private property Dead serious question Why isnt there any hate against her white face costume So blackface is racist but whiteface isnt Dont worry guys black people cant be racist Obligatory the originalhttpsyoutubeFgJSkptbs white face Thats racist Funny yes Whiteface Not exactly in good taste I support BLM but whiteface should also be frowned upon in the same way black face is always a terrible choice Whoa whoa whoa is that white face Is that allowed Im behind on my PC protocol Ah reddit Where racism doesnt exist unless its against white people  bro that ladys costume is racist AF I think its racist painting your face white if painting your face black is racist Is she doing white face because if she is that is not ok Whiteface racism is acceptable here That lady did white facerolling  cant have your cake and it eat it too But great costume Cant be racist if its not white people doin it silly billies using white face to mock someone  funny using black face even to dress up as someone you admire  racist got it so white face isnt racist double standard bs Halloween costumes are traditionally made as a mockery of scary things These two folks who originally perpetrated the act are absolutely deserving of mockery and they are scary in that they thought what they did was ok Nailed it removed If black face is racist does that make white face racist So what is the rule on painting faces Black face an obvious no White face allowed Hm She missed the mustard stain Epic fail You are awarded no points and may god have mercy on your soul All fun and games till you see a blackface costume That lady is a racist shes wearing white face Dont get me wrong I think this is funny as hell and Im in no way offended But how is doing white face okay and black face wrong Is it ok because those  were lunatics or is it ok because you cant be racist against white people Again I laughed when I saw this but it pondered the question how are we ever going to get equality if everyone needs their revenge Careful some idiot might call the police on those highly realistic guns carried by black people smh Fighting racism with racism always works man s white facing is racist White face is unnecessary I dont get it Its okay for people to go white face but black face is racist Woah I didnt even notice the white face at firstsurprised people arent upset over the picture Is that white face So let me get this straight She has visible white paint of some sort on her face and this is okay Hahah imagine dressing up like a black person for Halloween Peoples entire careers were ruined for shit like this The double standard and hypocrisy is truly frightening As I said in another comment the intent of the poster and the subjects in the photo are clear as day With all of the accusations of racism being flung around this right here is a legitimate case Behold Fuck racism fuck OP and the whiteface people in the picture and fuck the massive racial double standard Oh thats right white face is fine in  deleted I love that the rifle is tiny but the pistol is way bigger than the original The guy in the top right hand corner looks like terry crews  Where is my Yogurt The lady looks like younger Oprah So white face is fine but not black face Thanks reddit All these folks talkin about whiteface but I think shes just ashy I guess only black face is wrong I mean i dont really give a shit if black people do white face but it just isnt true that white face wasnt used to stereotype certain white subcultures ie the irishman and scotchirish hillbilly These were very much caricatures used to mock The rednosed hobo with a bindle and Yosemite Sam are the direct descendents of these caricatures of specific white populations And southern blacks were very much encouraged to look down upon poor whites as white trash and these populations were very much presented in minstrel shows as no better than blacks Which is clearly racist on multiple levels And American black people kinda did latch on to this You can see it in their use of the word peckerwood today and their disdain for redneck types Even though slave owners were clearly of a different class Classic divide and conquer of people with similar class interests TLDR  white face was definitely a thing though it was more classoriented And ironically African American culture did sort of latch on to some of the classist tropes about poor whites presented in minstrel shows So black face is wrong but white face is ok yall are some idiots Mustard stain Come on cant miss that White face huh That lady looks a lot like that kids mom from Season  of The Wire Is white face fine when blackface is scandalous Classic Reddit full of absolute bullshit Reported Black face white face yellow face brown face purple face Can we just stop all of them If people are going to be upset about black face and rightfully so why would people think white face is okay I know that black face probably feels MORE racist to a lot of people than white face but it should not be a competition It should not be an oh they treated us poorly for years so we should literally mock them in the same way I just want to live in a world where we dont masquerade as another race in an attempt to ridicule them sue me Is she doing white face Im not personally offended but the internet would throw a tantrum if it was a white woman doing black face Tbh i dont really knoe what the original couple is trying to do White people doing black face is unforgivable but black people doing white face is okay What the fuck is this racist shit Thank god white racism doesnt exist S Because its not abolishing all forms of bigotry in any way Its about ramping up the bigotry against non black people Im confused Is that White face Obviously black people cannot be racists and white facing is not a thing Meanwhile I had a white friend who dressed up as Steve Harvey with a black face to a costume party and had to leave because people were getting pissed lmao Oh because some cocksuckers  years ago used it to be actually racist it makes my friend a fucking racist Yeah thats not mental gymnastics at all Fuck you reddit I love how racism is only one directional Is that white face Dont see that very often Trigger discipline aside its not like they had no reason to be cautioushttpsyoutubeSwsPOaXcUt Cultural appropriation How is this not racist If a white couple dresses up in a mocking manner of a black couple theyd lose their jobs and be plastered all over social media I cant wait to see you talk at the next Republican National Convention LOL is that woman doing whiteface  racist      Oh my god this is amazing Really captured their inflated sense of selves Is she doing white face Thats racist af It was their property dumb asses If you march onto my property and bring your friends I will have something waiting for you also I dont get why people feel this behavior is ok What about if these were people of color You people would be yearling from the hill tops how your rights have been violated But because it is a BLM event it is ok Fuck this White face is cool Reddit cucks just upvote trash Trendy group think double standard idiots God Bless America Just burn this entire comment section Stupid bullshit like this causes division in our country Yeah Karen and Ralph suck That doesnt make this any less divisive People wonder why Trump is able to stir the pot This is his ammunition Is her whole life going to be destroyed because she put a bit of face paint on herself and dressed up as someone No didnt think so Wheres the mustard stain Forgot the mustard stain This is hilarious Anyone here mad about white face isnt actually mad about white face Youre just excited to get a chance to act like a victim This comment section proves that people dont know shit about black history and why black face is problematic Black face is racist but white face gets celebrated woah calm down jamal dont pull out the nine Our country is hilarious Instant classic Thank you so much I needed the laugh I love it Played out This is racist as fuck Isnt wearing White make up the same as an black face Or can only White people be racist Thats racist Serious question is white face ok It seems everyones panties gets bunched up when there is black face black face is funny too but youd get cancelled for posting that Is white face okay to do Terrible trigger discipline but if the stories about the original Incident were true and people did actually break through their gate I dont see a problem with them having their weapons and telling them to leave More light headed they NAILED the look for this costume This is hilarious What a dangerous photo I showed it to my cop buddy and he shot at it All Imm saying is that the protestors literally broke into their property Im scared of the Gun the dude is holding in Brazil only criminals have something like that Imagine a white couple today black facing for a photo op Heads would literally explode The dude did it right the woman did it racist Im sorry but thats just racist we wouldve gotten who they were without the white face we know who the dude is dressed as Its unnecessary and racist it just is SoWhiteface is cool Whiteface really Am I going to see a Fox News article on this asking why black people can do white face but white people cant do black face Hold on a second she can go as white face and thats acceptable I want to buy those two awesome costume creators a drink Thats awesome  I was actually gonna say I love

the word protest to have it added I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorpics if you have any questions or concerns This is a type of support I dont think Ive ever seen before As a Pole i have to clarify  The protests are not strictly against abortion ban It was just a trigger The people of Poland are protesting because they are sick and tired of the ruling government that is corrupt and does everything to turn Poland into a dictatorship They are constantly rising taxes restricting our freedoms and increasing bureaucracy The main slogan of the protests is WYPIERDALA which means GET THE FUCK OUT and JEBA PIS which means FUCK THE PIS the ruling party This could lead to a huge swing in political power in the country Good luck to all the protesters Stay safe I have never SEEN that amount of people That is extraordinary and will be impossible to ignore Are any of the Polish politicians reacting positively to the protests Are they acknowledging the massive protests as a sign of public opposition to the ruling  This was hugely under reported They said thousands protested This is at least s of thousands So where are the bans on a western government that removes womens civil rights Until  Sweden had rather strict abortion laws At that time it was not uncommon for Swedish women with unwanted pregnancies to go to Poland for abortion Now it is time that Sweden helps Polish women In Sweden every pregnant woman also nonswedish and nonresident has the right to perform an abortion up to and including week  of pregnancy For abortion in week  permission from Socialstyrelsen is needed and is given in special cases like severe damages to the fetus For a normal abortion up to and including week  the woman does NOT need to provide any reason for wanting to perform the abortion and has the right to not not be asked for a reason or be met with opposition in the decision to perform the abortion But if the woman so chooses she should get access to a consultationsupport meeting with a counselor or psychologist before andor after performing the abortion Nonswedish nonresidant women will however have to pay for the abortion themselves So Polish and other women who want to perform an abortion are welcome to Sweden There are ferries going from Poland to Karlskrona in Sweden The adress of a clinic in Karlskrona is stra Kvarngatan  Karlskrona phone     Fuck yes Poland Stand up for your rights Unbelievable how so many countries are trying to start up with this shit Just let women make their decisions Its basically admitting to a belief that some women cant make decisions at all Just do what we tell you and suffer the consequences of this one sided society As if its all their fault somehow for not controlling other people Its massively infuriating and even moreso as Ill never know the entirety of how it feels to live it as well What the fuck Holy shit these people could pick up those buses and make them crowd surf Conservatives We hate it when big government interferes in the lives of private citizens Also Conservatives We want the government to ban abortions because we dont like them Good We only just finally got rid of such a ban in Ireland It led to avoidable deaths innumerable traumatisations and absolutely ghoulish cases in the name of that fucking law And of course it most only affects the poor Abortion has and will ALWAYS be accessible to the rich because they simply travel abroad Fuck That Shit Go on Poland Demand your rights Im glad to see Poles standing up and saying Enough is Enough Honestly this should have happened back when PiS has passed that media law which lets them control the media Or when PiS used a sleezy trick to force constitutional judges into early retirement so that they can put their PiS loyalists into that office But I am glad that this is finally happening   This is what happens when you make laws based on religious beliefs and not the need of the people Wow abortion banned Love a good Warsaw uprising I was there it was unbelievable Never in my life Ive seen so many people gathered on the streets This picture is just the main gathering point the crowd stretched far down all four streets of that intersection It was also a very peaceful event Absolutely no fighting with the police in fact many police officers were supporting the protest There were a few incidents with idiots from nazi groups rushing into the crowd and spraying people with tear gas but they were quickly disbanded every time Few dozens of people were apprehended by the police and from what Ive heard only two or three were the actual protesters one got caught for breaking a trams window things like that The rest was those nationalist shitheads who just wanted to provoke a fight Most people were holding cardboards with a vast majority stating wypierdala get the fuck out in many different variations all directed at the current ruling political party called PIS The Polish language has a beautiful variety of swear words and people are creative at using them There were also many ridiculously funny slogans most deeply rooted in Polish culture and modern pop culture One cool example  someone was carrying a picture of Psyduck  that duckshaped Pokemon but with the name changed to PISduck depicted with a gray hair to resemble the current PIS leader His last name is Kaczyski which comes from kaczka which means duck in polish Pisduck also sounds a bit like pizdak which can be roughly translated to something like a cuntman So you already get the multilevel depth of some of these slogans I really hope something good comes out of it People are tired of the government and the abortion ban was the last straw EDIT Oh and EVERYONE was wearing a mask Theyd get scolded by others if they didnt Total number of people varies between  and  thousands depending on who reports it Ive read that the police dont want to publish their reports on that because they said its not a game of who gives a bigger number the unity is amazing This is what happens when fucking religious people gets to be in majority For anyone seeking context Protests in Poland have been happening for over a week now triggered by the Constitutional Courts Supreme Court ruling that abortion of fetuses with congenital defects is illegal Even before the ruling abortion law was very strict the strictest in Europe This is the same government that is also openly homophobic and called LGBTQ an ideology this is an actual quote There is a lot more to the story When is the last time there has been so much global unrest Has anything like this happened in history Hope the covid cases numbers dont drastically surge after this Jeba PIS Wheres Waldo before everyone thinks its about killing babies they dont have any follow through Regimes like this dont care that there is a pandemic or that people are hurting In the us lets add in the dearth of healthcare and our poor standing in maternal deaths and infant mortality I just dont believe its about saving babies If they wanted to save babies theyd bloody well save them Restricting abortion will keep more women at home and more likely to struggle and increase child abuse and neglect You can wag fingers and say they shouldnt and nobody wants that but they know full well itll happen And I dont mean abuse from the mothers lets not forget plenty of womens partners abuse the kids as well Crying about they should be given a chance at life is all well and good until some asshole is hurting their kids We will see a similar large scale protest when SCOTUS overturns Roe and allows states to ban abortion again right I cant believe its the year  and this still needs to be a thing Why are such basic freedoms always fucking always being taken away I see people in this commentary talking about how abortion is murder and the babies rights but this isnt even about normal abortion These new regulations forbid women to abort in case of health defects in the fetus so the woman is forced to carry the child even though it might not be able to survive outside the womb It is not only a total disregard of body autonomy but also cruel Be safe Polish protestors Solidarity from the US  But it is not only against abortion ban It is against current goverment and is arrogance incompetence and disrestpectfulness Old dudes in suits making the decisions that will shape OUR future long after theyre gone Its laughable Never have I seen so many people have to fight for basic rights and I shouldnt have to see it again basic rights should be given to everyone Keep up the good fight Poland Anybody else find it a little ironic that a country which has no social health care and  million guns is so opposed to abortion under the guise of pro life Good for them we need to move forward not backward wypierdalac That there is a lot of COVID Wow thats how you come together as one If my black people did this in the US A lot of things would actually start to change I salute them in Warsaw  Prolifers I hope those people die of corona virus Me Yep no irony in that statement None at all Does anybody know where in Warsaw this picture was taken  For media in my country this is a protest of few hundrets people The last polish presidential election was held just  months ago and only  of voters did vote PiS wont give a shit if you wont vote Sudden covid outbreak in Warsaw politicians baffled Amazing  wish we could unify like this in America Top that blm Props to everyone there Sane Americans take notes Just an FYI If youre in Poland and need support getting an abortion Abortions Without Bordershttpsabortioneu recommends you contact Kobiety W Siecihttpswwwmaszwybornet for help The Abortion Support Networkhttpswwwasnorgukdonate funds abortions for those in Poland who have to travel for an abortion  I imagine theyre going to get busier now with more complicated cases For those who want to put their money where their rage is please donate I find abortion repulsive However its not my body not my choice You can hold two ideas in your head at a time and not explode Why are we going back to the middle ages This is a huge set back for mankind Who does the government of any country thinks it is to tell people what to believe in I thunk that as an adult Im capable if deciding if for ME personally abortion is a sin or immoral Freedom of religion right Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to GOD what belongs to GOD Live and let live Abortions are going to keep happening the problem its that now they need to be clandestine and the only thing this accomplished is putting more women at risk Absurd  Abortion is freedom Dont let this go Regardless of your views on abortion there are numerous examples throughout history that banning it simply doesnt work Go look at what happened in communist Romania Abortions were illegal What happened Women just found illegal and often very unsafe ways to have abortions I believe the number of abortions actually increased I get its a very sensitive and unpleasant topic but making abortions illegal is not the answer It doesnt work and it causes more harm than good And just like that Warsaw became the new Covid Hotspot Love this  Hope they see change Glad to see my Polish brethren stand against injustice Glad to see theres people that stand up for human rights Meanwhile im watching america getting silenced And yet in the US we just appointed the Handmaids Tale jurist to the Supreme Court I guess well have a few years of similar protests Any government who talks about or wants to make a law against women rights should be in prison deleted We could very well see this here in the US if the new conservative backwards thinking SCOTUS majority reverses Roe Yes rally against the religious laws that restrict your freedom when it affects you but keep the religious laws that create the lgbt free zones its all from the same bloody books Religion has no place in government people should be free to be the way they were born people should be free to have autonomy over their own bodies and own lives Just in case You see other pictures from the protests  many protesters carry signs saying    This is message Jeba PIS hidden behind those stars which means Fuck PIS current ruling party that is causing all

This is what strength looks like Hi there To all of you that are saying its in the mid of pandemic Our government has released this law change having it it mind  now they can blame protesters for the spread of the virus  not themselves not being able to deal with it Our government is not the smartest one The world is pretty much done with bullcrap far Right bullshittery as a pole living outside

come about deleted You people are so fucking weird rAverageRedditor Dont post kids online Okay now put on this costume so auntie can get some internet points of course cause what yearold doesnt go nuts at the thought of jurisprudence Press X to doubt Missed a golden opportunity for zombie RBG Oh yeah Name her top  rulings How inspiring I Cant wait to shamelessly dress up my daughter as a partisan political figure to smugly score virtue points with my circle jerking friends Imagine using children to farm karma rwokekids Thats weird Weve heavily pushed our politics on this child for Halloween Reddit moment Man what the fuck even are Americans Im not trying to be rude I respect RBG and I dont mind this at all However as a nonAmerican I wanna ask Isnt halloween all about scary outfits Sorry for my ignorance lol rthathappened  Dont post kids on reddit  No she fucking didnt  Using kids for farming karma is so unbelievably absurd and vile Yeah I doubt it It feels a bit forced At first I thought of judge judy rwokekids Mmhmmm yeah your kid wanted to dress as rgb Cool ghost costume Cringe at family forcing politics and old ideas on their own children But to dress them up for real life karma for your friendsfamily who will be totallly razzed by how your children live out your ideology to a T is wrong on so many levels But then to take a picture and post it online as if she understand anything this court justice ever did let alone what the internet memers will do to her photograph is disgusting Missed opportunity for zombie rbg Youth Bader Ginsberg No kid is going to

decomposition She looks like that actress who played Flora in Bly Manor Dang shes even the same size It is not healthy to be obsessed with someone that old or who died tell her to go out and play outside instead of this nonsense You mean you forced her to dress as an old lady judge and she has no idea why She is dead after all Missed opportunity to make zombie or vampire RGB A more accurate RBG costume would be bones in a casket Robert Bowney Gr Im a zombie Im Batman Im a skeleton Im a civil rights leader advocating for womens rights  I got BATARANGS This trend is already dead removed Amy Coney Barrett Youre welcome PS Your niece isnt obsessed with her its her parents One of my friends dressed up as Ruth Vader Ginsburg today Shes a teacher so her students were greeted with a Vader mask on their zoom calls today  Lol cause you made her obsessed about it My thoughts that she didnt have a clue who she was prior to her death rWokeKids I read the title before the image loaded so my dyslexia thought that she was going to be a RGB keyboard or something removed this poor kid has no idea who that is No she isnt Should have dressed as ACB Shes way better This is excellent the only logical next step is Ruth Vader Ginsburg httpsiimgurcomAalipng Cringe removed You never can go wrong with witch costumes nice Thats so sad that politics are top of her mind Shes like  Come on sweetie

take this off now Kinda cringe ngl st off to soon tbh and ndly no kid really cares about politics so i cant help but feel this wasnt her choice But yeah lets use kids for internet points weird as fuck Ask your niece why she didnt resign during Obamas term Terrible RBG Is not someone to have your child look up to No shes not Her parents saw on opportunity to use their kid to show off their political beliefs which is a weirdcreepy way of virtue signaling rwokekids Oh yeah im sooooo sure Jesus Christ this is sad Your niece isnt obsessed you are No child is obsessed with a Supreme Court Justice like its a superhero figure I want to believe this is true but I just cant I didnt even know about RBGs career until she died and I just went through AP US History in high school Mostly based on the past obviously but we discussed the present a lot and I live in a pretty leftleaning town too Nah her parents are obsessed with her Man Reddit is a pure propaganda piece Imagine being like  years old and being used as your families karma pump Leave kids out of politics i bet she isnt Lmfao I highly doubt a damn  year old is obsessed with supreme court justice without severe adult influence Obsessed Get help I think you meant My nieces mom is obsessed with RBG and is making her wear an awful halloween costume No kid is going to be obsessed with a dead judge The mom did this to resist  rcringe Did she build a natural gas pipeline through indigenous land to celebrate What a boring child Needs a brooch Now that she is gone the supreme court is ruthless My mom is right wing and she dressed us up in political outfits when I was  I had no clue thats what the were Im still somewhat right wing but I do not appreciate that she did that Dont do this to your kids No she isnt You are This is the most embarrassing thing I have ever seen No kid is obsessed with a Supreme Court Judge cmon now Did you pressure her into this Ya thats some fuckin bullshit rcringe Reddit is turning into a left wing political propaganda outlet You can support RBG and still be aware of this sad fact  Oh brother Legit confused why liberals are still infatuated with RGB when the nomination of Barrett was the direct result of RGB refusing to retire during Obamas presidency even after Obama had asked hernot to mention that she had by that time been diagnosed with two unique types of cancer and was in her s Its always been clear that if the Republicans got a majority they would try to overturn Roe v Wade She knew this and still didnt retire Yikes Your niece probably didnt know who RBG was until you made her put that bullshit on Great person to be obsessed with Nice to see that some kids still have worthy real life heroes I hope this really was her idea Very cute You should tell her about ACB rwokekids That doesnt look like red green blue What is RGB and is this actually a girl How in the fuck does an  year old become obsessed with someone from the us supreme court justices Thats real spooky A nice finishing touch would be to have her carry around a sopher clamp and pieces of a ripped apart unborn child That would be extra spooky Yeah Im sure Obsessed with red blue green Her Wtf Scariest twist Theres nothing organic about this I dont see RGB at all Yeah this is a sad parents flex From an outsider Id be like oh you are brain washing your kids to your views and not letting them make their own Now I find the Supreme Court quite a bit ruthless I am sure a preteen finally made a decision of to fully support a political figure as high as Supreme Court Judge I thought this sub was about interesting photography but so far its only political Kinda cringe bro Yes a  year old is obsessed with a politician rredditmoment Mom I want to be the grim reaper for halloween Yeah sure whatever Heres your cloak Before you put the hood on let me get a picture with your face showing What about my scythe You dont need a scythe Also here wear this lace doily All Grim Reapers have a doily Why is s kid obsessed with a politician how sad is that No she isnt and no she didnt Topical My  year old is dressed as a carrot removed removed Ruthkanda forever removed That Justice we sorely need Nows not a great time to be an RBG fan not because shes passed away but mainly because the sociopaths in power have put someone on the supreme court who is the literal opposite of RBG fuck them Is she also a fan of her picture posted to Reddit where she will be subjected to criticism for useless internet points EDIT RBG might have helped stop the imminent repeal of abortion if shed have retired during Obamas administration Soon will be the blue hair and demons screaming I dont think she is dont push politics on your kids This shit makes the left look bad its pure obvious falsehood and narrative pushing through children She would have been thrilled to see this Glad young girls are seeing her as a the icon she was I sincerely hope she is inspired to follow a similar path thats real cute OP The amount of people who have been claiming g their kids are obsessed with RBG is staggering I know i sound like an asshole but I dont believe it was her idea Poor kid Wonder where this obsession came from why would a little girl be obsesssed with a political figure Your niece looks like shes going to grow up to be a really annoying bitch You Ruth Badabelieve it Who the hell is obsessed with RBG rThatHappened No doubt RGB was a legendary figure but I had no real idea what SCOTUS was when I was this young lmao Idk anyone that did This reminds me of a reddit thread the other day where a person was claiming the difference between the left and the right is that the left doesnt indoctrinate their childrenright And this kids is what parents forcing their political views down our throats looks like removed Hey ma why the hell are you making me wear this costume Downvote because exploiting children for internet points I feel sorry for this kid Most likely wanted to be something cute or scary like her friends but her parents couldnt resist pushing their politics Inger and ruining her Halloween Very sad Im soo getting downvoted for this but rwokekids Poor kid AH ITS A GHOST Sounds like your niece has a good eye for role models Some skeleton face makeup would have kept the costume a little more current  Its almost like she wants to get ahead of men in her field while doing less work Hello cringe department No the fuck she didnt lmao Let these kids be Disney characters and super heroes like they really want Big nerd vibes Kids are weird these days Thats gonna be a yikes from me dawg I

someone from my family would play Farts and would win instead  the horrifying year all the jokes came true This is the most accurate cards against humanity statement in existence That was the Trump card I was judging War what is it good for The German exchange student played Ethnic cleansing Youre doing it wrong The point of the game is to make ridiculous statements that dont perfectly describe reality Oh god not these totally random cards again Im having a lets not talk or think about the election party Tuesday night This game will have to make an appearance I cant wait until the election is over Or you might be rappers Kanye West Cent Lil Wayne or Lil Pump rredditmoment rcringetopia This is dumb af Good god i hate this site The Trump campaign in a nutshell If you think things are bad

games Custom card BurnLootMurder seems to always be the winner Americans desperately need to travel abroad and see what the rest of the world is like Haha we fucked Unpopular opinion Redneck is offensive treating poor rural people like many people do beacuse they are conservative is just not ok those people really suffer and we should have empathy for them not disgust that is why they end up following populist and extremist i sat around flipping through cards to make a meme i have no friends  Im pretty sure its this type of attitude that got him elected in the first place Are rednecks cool with the pandemic spreading because it disproportionately affects people of color Mood Why are the comment sections of rpics always full of Trump trolls Unpopular opinion I dont like Cards against Humanity I know many people who would nonironically play this hand and at the same time think theyre pwning the libs This is the worst timeline good day reddit orange man bad upvote to left opinions arent allowed removed You totally didnt pick the cards yourself to get this combination it wad totally random right I mean what are the chances Im guessing the missing word is trump I hadnt thought about it before now but if they havent done it already the CAH people could make a really fantastic  expansion pack lol Right now were living in the same dystopia the movie Idiocracy predicted I hate this game clever answers never get picked Its always just the ones that have something sexual on the card that win when I play This is hysterical Keep that same energy after Trump wins again Sincerely a NYC redneck I think Jeff Foxworthy is gonna sue somebody Oof lol Nah we hate it too Truer words never spoken Is there an online version Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Just perfect People love to watch other people suffer  Game set match If yooooooouuu can read this in Jeff Foxworthys accent You might be a redneck I played for the first time last night and that card came up I had the Three Fifths Compromise but the winner was sex with animals Finally completed the game Appropriate Perfect ending We started playing with our eyes closed putting the cards down because my wife and her friend would purposely not pick mine even though it was the best Remember when posting cards against humanity stopped being a thing I miss that All the ones I ever met seemed to hate everything about modern times Please tell me what camera youre using because oh ho ho I guess Im not a redneck Lol dystopian  I have an humanity hates trump expansion pack   I mean youre not wrong i was playing last night my black card was millions of copies sold donald trumps the art of  top two were not being in my sons life and fascism  bad upvotes on the left rpolitics Thats terrifyingly accurate as I sit in my driveway because we havent had power for almost a week thanks to an ice storm Thanks CovidTrumpClimateChange  Jesus the dystopia on the other side is just as bad gotta love it when the two presidential candidate options are sick dementia pedophile with clear cut evidence of both and sick dementia pedophile with clear cut evidence of both Life is good My best play was White people like  I played White People The rednecks are saying the same thing about anyone who trusts in vaccines and contact tracing Are we going to go back to pics of CAH hands every day for a month now I thought CAH wasnt

beautifully quaint town it is this cant be real Even though this is Photoshopped the OG picture is still gorgeous To me at least would move there if I was wanting to move to the States This is content from those instagram influencers with a lifestyle clothing brand The ability to create such a dazzling facade can only be attributed to the need to hide very deep and very dark secrets this is the work of a psychopathic power couple and all should fear them Was the exposire time increased I see stars on the sky Anyways it is very pretty Cool picture but it looks rather modified still looks cool

in loovvve Thats as fake as the non racism in our state This is my dream Make this into a jigsaw puzzle You see that Thats where I was born You know one day my my mother she put me on her knee and she said to me Gaston my son the world is a beautiful place You must go into it and love everyone try to make everyone happy and bring peace and contentment everywhere you go and so I became a waiter Well

closely you can still hear the hippies vomiting from the bad acid I almost want to dive into that photo and spend the rest of my life there Is the picture doctored yes But so what This image captures how it feels to walk down the driveway on a brisk fall afternoonafter a long hot summer The magic of being there is lost scrolling through  images a day on your phone withouta filter The talent here is doctoring the image to capture the emotion of the moment not grabbing the proper shade of red on the building or orange of the leaves Criticism of this photo is like saying a poem describing the same sceen isnt worth reading because the poet embellished the way a cool breeze feels on your cheek when the rest of you is bundled up behind your favorite own jacket that you havent worn in  months The traffic on this one dirt road in rural Vermont just to see this specific farm is insane all autumn long Its become a destination Thats a puzzle worthy photo its like over the garden wall This photo would make a nice puzzle Boost the saturation But sire our realism Just do it Yeah but fast forward less than a month thenshit snowy and equally beautiful Wait this is actually a real place  Quiet peaceful until the HEADLESS HORSEMAN rides in Holy shit run for your lives Stunning ik this image is heavily edited but it brings me such a cozy feeling of peace Thats like the real life view of Potsfield from Over the Garden Wall Especially for a tenyearold What a time I looked at this and my immediate thought was  Cross Stitch Pattern This is actually Joe Perrys house believe it or not Im just waiting for Chevy Chases dog to go running across the background Good ol Pottsfield No snoopy  Peace  tranquility  and the slow regard of silent things Every Year Like a fairy tale but with ticks Then its a horror film Pictures like this they turn into puzzles What should do for a weekend visiting Do they welcome visitors from New York Anyone else see pics of cabins and woods like this and dont think cute but think thats a murder story waiting This is reposted every fall but its so beautiful I really dont care Oh my gosh breath taking What a creation of color Do you work for KJP lol So everyones just gonna ignore the pumpkin centipede in the bottom right If it was less Saturated and uh Vibranceated itd look much better httpsiimgurcomgLJPfujpg Still fake but better methinks Id kill to live in a place like this Hey Im from Vermont and I know where this is Im pretty sure Also I dislike that people just think Vermont is just syrup and ski resorts Im mean it is but we have other things to like a lot of history and stuff Looks expensive This reminds me of Animal Crossing So beautiful I moved to this great state just a few years ago Best move I have ever made   I am a real human and can confirm this is how real reality looks like rfairytaleasfuck I would enjoy visiting Vermont in October Looks like one of those Lang calendar photos Def would live here Id live here so

locusaaahhh so pretty Thomas Kinkade has entered the chat Or is it Kink Aid Jesus This looks beautiful I could almost smell the scent of the leaves and feel the autumn breeze in my hair  Wow breathtaking This isnot Woodstock This is that town in red dead redemption  Reddit loves saturation I use to live in Burlington Vermont too for like  years as a student exchange program its so fucking gorgeous I live in russia now but man waking up to maple leaves and wide beutiful grasslands isnt something I will forget I just cant express how gorgeous the state is Hate Woodstock Ton of snobs Windsor is better in al aspects athletics community you name it Real Life jigsaw puzzle Im so glad to see this reposted on reddit again One year later I wanna live there All nice until you realize that Internet is slower than dialup or simply not available It certainly looks like a great place to live in That should be a puzzle Man do you guys hate Photoshop The image looks great imo its not oversaturated nor overHDRed like some of you are claiming This looks like the first level in Fable Where you had to get a present for your sisters birthday All thats missing is a bridge Then put everything on fire  This is from Kiel James Patricks Instagram at least post where you got the photo from My sister lives here it is beautiful but this pic is a bit enhanced  amazing Howre the people that live in Woodstock Like a dream  Photoshop Adobe I didnt even realize a place like this actually existed This is absolutely beautiful It looks like one of those highly Photoshopped pictures from KJPs Instagram Filter much Fable  vibes fairytale I was supposed to go there on vacation  months ago then COVID happened  Reminds me a bit of Hoggett Farms This makes me want to move to Vermont mmmm fairy tail httpsmediatenorcomimagesfcaeabdfcdebecetenorgifitemidhttpsmediatenorcomimagesfcaeabdfcdebecetenorgifitemid Tegrity farms Americas Switzerland I swear to god this picture looks different everytime I see it Holy Photoshop Batman This is incredible  Fairytale  I know its fake but i love this picture Is there a high res version I read that as Woodcock Vermont and thought WTF I fee like Ive seen several altered versions of this photo This would make a great puzzle Would definitely buy removed Cant help but ask myself why I live where I live when places like this ACTUALLY exist and I could go there and experience the vibe this is so beautiful I always see this house in every season TIL that uncanny valley can apply to pictures of places too Thats so heavily edited that it actually creeps me out I swear I saw this pic when browsing puzzles to buy for my parents Jesus All the negativity Its art Photography is art Its all doctored Do you think the negatives you gave to Blacks back in the day werent manipulated with contrast sat exp ext Come on Do you think any pro photographer doesnt edit their pics for the best result This is a great piece of ART Fuck off with the comments about editing Thats cool seeing a photo near my hometown The picture is of a farm outside Woodstock Its been featured many times on magazine covers Budweiser commercials movies like Forrest Gump and Funny Farm Do you dumbasses not realize that when its this sunny out you cant actually see all those stars in the sky and that this picture is photoshopped to hell Edited to look like a fairytail That looks like the ending screen in Mega Man  httpstvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpTearJerkerMegaMan Does anyone know exactly where this picture was taken Asking for a friend Woodstock is my favorite Vermont town My husband and I talk about moving there from time to time Beautiful Everyone rightfully bitching about the fakeness of the picture while ignoring fairy tail in the title I live near there that many stars in the day time Those vibrant leaves Most fake thing Ive ever seen This is making my Salem loving hocus pocus ass so happy Its my dream to live in a small New England town thats cold all year round and autumny Gorgeous Love this picture Great work Id love to visit this place some day This photo gets more and more altered each year that in a hundred years its gonna be a microwaved meme I swear this photo gets more and more photoshopped every year Jigsaw puzzle I want this as a puzzle New England is seriously under rated Thats damn beautiful I kind of want to move out into an area like this after living in cities for a while Wallahi I appreciate nature most during autumn this is BEAUTIFUL  The best part of the photo is the photoshopped smoke coming out of the chimney The editors piece de resistance Reminds me of the first episode of over the garden wall series Wow thats beautiful I dont care if its filtered or altered or whatever other critique anyone can come up with Ive seen this posted at least  times and every time I see it I feel like its the most comfortable place on earth It is a Thomas Kinkade painting that has come to life KJPftw Nope thats where serial

Adam Savage from mythbusters made the octopus arms for this costume This was a few years back right The best thing about this picture is that two days before the costume was completed Alice told her dad that she didnt want to be SpiderGirl for Halloween anymore she was going to be Dorothy and Patton had to be the Cowardly Lion He had to convince her to put the costume on for one picture and then they changed into their Wizard of Oz costumes and went TrickorTreating He tells the story here httpswwwmenshealthcomtrendingnewsapattonoswalthalloweenhttpswwwmenshealthcomtrendingnewsapattonoswalthalloween I love how normal his kitchen looks Patton Oswalt best dad only second to mine Of course mine is the best Hes such a wholesome dad I listened to his podcast with Bert Kreischer and he had me crying because it was so sweet Man Patton Oswalt seems to have so much fun as Dad Always love these This man is a national treasure Shame his wife passed away  This guy is wholesome as hell Love this Dear reddit gods please give us a Patton Oswalt Doc Oc movie For a second I thought he was ACTUALLY gonna play Doctor Octopus for an upcoming film and I was like thats super fucking weird but im  up for it SpiderMan  was the best Marvel movie to date fight me I remember going on a hike and seeing him come down the trail as I was going up he was all sweaty I will never forget that day It was a brief moment but always cherished I wonder how many things he has knocked over so far Orsmond Ford you can depend on Orsmond Ford great name great cars My wife was Doc Ock and I was Noir Spidey for Halloween last year I think hes having more fun than her lol Best dad ever I love Patton Oswalt so much This is what being a dad is all about Go Patton You are crushing it buddy Love this guy so wholesome This could also be repurposed for a Stranger Things costume later down the line  Ooomg this is so cute I had never before considered how Patton Oswalts kitchen would look But that is exactly how I would have pictured it This is awesome Doc Quad I could actually see him as Doc Ock i know hes technically in the MCU from Agents of SHIELD but now i will be incredibly disappointed if he doesnt play Doc Ock in the next SpiderMan movie Now Patton Oswalts Twitter is just Oh Shit and a retweet of something Low cabinets The guy has books in his kitchen Thats way more books in his kitchen that I think a kitchen should warrant Where does he store all his old chinese takeout containers random array of spices he uses once then stores for  decades and assortment of single use kitchen gadgets tentacle hentai flashbacks Why is it Ock His last name is Octavius Wouldnt it be Doc Oc Ok wait a minute here He just pulled off a RDjr move He looks like bubbles from Trailer park boys dressed as Dr Octavius Hes literally a dude dressed as a dude playing another dude Hes a good guy but this is  for him Couple years ago but still good Love Patton Oswalt and the costume duo is the sweetest thing ever But just a question here who the heck puts books in their kitchen cabinets Thats quite a commitment to not cooking I love the fact that he is a so wholesome dad and the daughter too I love to see good parenting And his wife is cosplaying Gwen Stacy Nobel prize I need a movie with him as doc oc But only if hes allowed to be funny Cool to the nth Nic doc omg his kitchen looks just like mine That would be great casting He cant leave the kitchen i really wish he woulda been DEMON COP deleted Going old school Hope they have happy Halloween this year as well Genius Has Patton been in the MCU yet I now need him as Doc Ock Correction thats one of the Agent Koenigs with his daughter I wont claim to be able to distinguish which Koenig this is though Sweet Now read out his name fast I love this so much this is from  That face mask wouldve made a perfect Kamala Khan  Great fatherdaughter costume tho  Awesome How do you get out of the kitchen tho Awwwww Love that Did he ever apologize to James Rolfe I love him this is adorable Call em Dr Strange No that one is taken This man is a treasure  Some one hide Payton Oswalt from Nicholas Cage cause he is a National treasure Imagine trying to walk around in that Doc Ock costume wow his daughter looks exactly like her mom My god This is amazing Didnt Adam Savage help him with that costume because it was the Halloween right after his wife passed away I would have thought she would want to be a my little pony or something the hair and mask made me think kamala khan for a second as a spidergirl costume its better than the pink abomination ive seen but i wish they would actually make a costume that looks like the spidergirl characters outfit instead of just throwing a skirt on a spiderman top and giving them a eye only mask patton is a real life pricksaw him throw a temper tantrum at a resturant last year what an asshole Fun fact Adam Savage from mythbusters build him that costume What the fuck is going on in those kitchen cabinets hey assistant slave make me a costume money is  as always  not a problem I want to be praised by the internet yes sir Those tentacles remind me of a neothelid Now hes MODOK Shes sooo young Oh man I forget sometimes and then I remember and then Im sad You know youre rich when you have a full blown library in your kitchen I love wholesome shit like this what a fantastic costume man and grade A effort from Patton seems like a really great dad his murdered wife as gwen stacy Fat ass unfunny comedian with a lot of strong opinions who got lucky in the acting business and now suddenly people give a fuck about his Halloween costume deleted Patton you offer your girl to Satan yet Isnt this the guy that killed his wife He Killed his wife Hey didnt this guy murder his wife This dude should not be anywhere near kids look into it Patton Oswalt is a piece of shit B books in the kitchen I want that kitchen DOCTOR OCTOGONAPUS Doc Ock I love his kitchen He is using his lovely cabinets to store books My kinda fella It looks like Patton Oswalt spent serious money on his doc ock arms and bought his daughters spider man costume at Walmart and his wife as Gwen Stacy That costume looks less like spider girl and more like spider ma am Which would be cuter in my opinion Doc Ock more like Do Cock     So son have u ever heard of hentai Pattons Oswalt has kids Sooo Patton Oswalt had consensual sex Who the fuck keeps books in the kitchen cabinets Every time I see Patton Oswalt my first thought is  Hes going to hell for being an atheist Who is this guy Before or after he went crazy political removed I know that patton is a great dad but dressing up in silly costumes is the new virtue signal for I am a great father Not pictured is his wife who is getting the rest of her RBG costume on Somebody actually married this turd Wonders never ceases Ive seen enough hentai to know where this is going god this guys annoying Not shown his wife in the MJ Jessica Jones  costume Wait Who buys a twoperson costume for themselves and their young daughter  and spends like x as much on

friends whos baby came extremely early and was airlifted to a neonatal unit in a bigger city Mom wasnt strong enough to travel to see him for an agonizing two weeks After a  hour car ride she arrived at the hospital to see her son for the first time It was Halloween and although he was struggling to live  tubes and wires attached the nurses had somehow dressed him in a red satin devils costume with little horns pitch fork and a black pointy moustache and goatee painted on his tiny face Mom burst into tears and was flabbergasted that they had done this to her fragile baby without her permission She wasnt expecting that the first time seeing him hed be wearing a devils costume  especially so since her religion views Halloween as a pagan ritual and prohibits celebrating it I think these nurses meant well but Mom felt that dressing a premie in a costume was for their own fun and it probably put the baby at some unnecessary risk just disturbing it to get the costume on or by exposing it to germs from wherever the costume came from Fortunately her baby survived but was in hospital for months but things turned out fine U from pitt Hes doing that Jesus mudra with his right hand bless their heart thats so heartwarming best wishes to your son So much cuteness in one photo I have spoken What a nurse Oh my gosh what a precious little angel Sending Baby Yoda all of my love

US is about to fall off a cliff tomorrow Hey I can see my house from here What led to the grand canyon over other important landmarks It looks so good Thats really pretty Youre talented Might want to add explosions and fire in a few days if  were to win again Very nicely done I just realized the river at the bottom of the Grand Canyon represents the Mississippi River I appreciate the subtle use of red and blue dividing both sides of the canyon Wow never knew the US is one big canyon I did know its trash though What a lovely picture Frankly we dont deserve it Thank you for such a nice piece of art We looks so lonely without our hat though Is it by chance that the river in the painting is where the Mississippi River is Looks awesome Hey thats really cool  Hmm been in Ohio my entire life how did I miss the majestic geography I remember it flatter As an American I can say there isnt enough fire and civil unrest for this to be accurate Looks great though Nice Are you working on another where America is on fire We will need it shortly Ty for including Alaska and Hawaii Great work Thank you for being nice about us We are going through some crazy and bad shit and it is a breath of fresh air to see people from other countries depict something positive about the US We dont deserve this The irradiated desert wasteland once known as the United States In the end we are all Americans Good day neighbor Ouch Grand Canyon definitely describes our current situation That is incredible but where is the fire and brimstone lol the united states is so beautiful id love to travel through again once this is all over The chasm is spot on but it needs more flames Very cool finally a something not negative about the united states Awesome Can you paint one of our girl Canada next And can I then print it out and put in on my wall Im Canadian but currently studying in Germany Wait its all the grand canyon Stunning Looks great As a native resident of Arizona I love this Its absolutely beautiful Lol thanks Canada We are tired and need a friend Ugh why We fucking suck US doesnt deserve to be made into art unless its a literal shit storm A tornado full of turds Id pay to have that artwork Oh wait I wouldnt I have no job and no stimulus because of covid and our joke of a government Oh well Aw Thanks pal Nothing more fitting to represent the US right now than a gigantic chasm xB All jokes aside it looks great  I wish we were as good of neighbors to Canada and Mexico as they are to us Amazing People outside America just dont realize how big the Grand Canyon is Howwhy did you choose the Grand Canyon for the scene  happy Arizonan Its even split  I miss my country Super sexy pic Reminds me of home  I love it As a Yankee to the south I have much for Canada in my heart Especially the poutine and the beautiful beautiful city of Montreal Fuck yeah Just want to say Thanks for painting our Good Side Our Bad Side is really overbearing lately We are not worthy of your kindness Alaska is a smile boi now But truly Awesome work There should be a lot more fire but still lovely painting So thats what Canadians think the US really looks like Interesting take In all seriousness though thats an amazing painting Thanks for including Michigan I like it Looks great neighbor You do great work Thats us divided with a huge canyon between Beautiful work Gorgeous We dont deserve you Wow pretty Americas been through some rough times lately but damn if there isnt still some real beauty here Its nice to see someone from another country who isnt condescending to us for a change There have been a lot of comments about America and its people lately that have been less than encouraging and while I cant say its completely unwarranted its also a little bit demoralizing to be painted as dumb and naturally unempathetic Politically our country has taken a dive but we are really hoping to be able to crawl back out of this pit we got ourselves in over the next few days and its looking like we are going to be able to do it with this next election so fingers crossed Your picture really makes me feel hopeful I really like Canada too by the way That is beautiful And right now we can use all the good vibes we can get Behold a nation divided in its time of night the river that divides is bright but the heavens are brighter still Thanks for remembering us wouldnt blame you for wanting to build yourselves a wall Dont make like half of us down here Wear a mask stay home Beautiful artwork btw This is amazing Ive started at it for hoursI would love to see you paint the  continents with how well this turned out Good that you drew it so that people will have a reference what it looked like prior to Nov rd  Oh so you think our country is a giant crater split in two in a wasteland setting with an endless dark cast over us You nailed it Looks very nice But since I live in the US I can attest that your next painting needs more fire Epic Finally someone remembered Alaska Thank you kind stranger It warms my heart Enjoy it while it lasts Pretty sure were gonna burn the entire place down tomorrow Stay tuned Post this to rarizona and rgrandcanyon Thanks for including Alaska and Hawaii This is beautiful Thank you Its beautiful Also ps Pls dont hate us forever I promise we arent all terrible Hey look A map on Reddit that actually includes Hawaii Interesting the Mississippi River location is intentional There truly is a great divide here in the US Thanks but truthfully we rarely think of you at all Horseshoe bend Thank you for being so kind with your beautiful picture You could easily have drawn a dick and still been accurate From one Canadian to another I love this painting Ive been to the Grand Canyon once and was in awe of its size and beauty I dont know why but I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders Thanks from the US Its really good but its missing fires and red hat people fighting blue hat people Was it purposeful symbolism with having a giant canyon running through it Fantastic stuff You might need to set the picture on fire to be accurate after tomorrow but love your work Can you do one for Australia PLS SND HLP Much better than the actual US We dont deserve this generosity however thank you Nice eh Was making the Colorado River approximately align with the Mississippi River intentional You missed the terrifying look of oncoming dystopia Its a subtle difference but its what makes the USA the USA This is beautiful thank you Thanx You dont know me the US is a politcal house of fuckery Its blood red with the blood of the down trodden and minorities FML In my eyes the middle to south is like desert and dread and the mid and north is limitless It should be on fire For accuracy Mayne This is greathow much Love it Was the idea of the colorado river matching up with the mighty mississippi intentional Id like to think so  Thank you for this As an American who drove Uber in Vegas for three years Canadians were my hands down favorite people to drive around I love Canadians always have always will I mean you gave us hockey all dressed chips and Letterkenny And for that I am forever grateful You forgot the fire  As good as this is lets be honest The Americans dont really deserve it Looks like the southwest my part of the US I love it You should add more fire because this place is Hell Thats insanely good thank you  Gorgeous Saw the title and thought  oh another picture of a dumpster fire instead I was pleasantly surprised Do you mind if I just stare at this for the next week or so Thats beautiful And thank you for not painting us as a black hole Im Canadian but I live in the US I absolutely love this depiction of the country It is really beautiful I hope you create one of Canada too  Please paint Mexico You forgot the black hole Its beautiful You remembered both halves of Michigan ahh yes a desolate wasteland with sparse life I always wanted to visit the Alaskan Islands  You wouldnt believe how many Americans think that Alaska and Hawaii are right next to each other southwest of Mexico  Are you saying we are divided or am I reading in to this too much Its beautiful but if you set it on fire itll more accurately reflect our current sitch Speaking as a citizen of the United States we dont deserve this Nice Now do every state I vote Texas first Its beautiful Like the Milky Way in it You misspelled Divided Needs more fire Looks great but alaska is looking a little brown tho Looks awesome dude TIL the US is one big canyon and I live in the night sky like simbas dad This is very nice and the sentiment is touching Unfortunately as a resident of the USA my first thought was yeah thats about how deep the divide is these days Im sorry Ive become too tainted to appreciate your kind art The Grand Canyon I really like this piece Also with tomorrow being Election Day its pretty poignant to have it be a depiction of the Grand Canyon in the middle of the states could be titled A Land Divided Im no art critic but you missed the raging selfabsorbed ignorant harmful lunatic running this place that is full of wildfires police brutality systemic class inequality no access to healthcare a broken education system the murder of black and brown people one of the highest Covid rates in the world and more political and social unrest than a meth addict tripping at a silent auction I like the colors though aww thanks If Id had the skill Id do one back I hope somebody will Thank you for remembering us Sincerely Hawaii Thank you Everyone hates us right now not that we dont deserve it But some love is appreciated Hope we are not making to much noise below you Oh if only the US was actually this beautiful What a nice portrayal of our country shame we dont deserve it haha Is that Dead Horse Point near Moab Utah Just out of curiosity Did you use a stencil By the way its really beautiful Beautiful view of Toroweap probably my favorite view of the Grand Canyon I see you also used the American spelling of neighbours to avoid confusing them Well done Hi neighbor Can I crash on your couch for a while Thank you for getting our good side its amazing Speaking of the Midwest theres this highway called The Loneliest Road in America Route   miles  km that cuts right thru something like  miles of wilderness in the Midwest Might be a source of further paintings Nice job and very cool And a very welcome relief from politics and negativity One reason I always loved visiting Canada was the people I met My employer also has Canadian offices and theyve always been very classy people too Im moving from the US to Canada very soon You need a dumpster on fire somewhere in there Whoa there kinda seems like youre trying to abscond with a chunk of the Northwest Angle Though you have made it more angular so maybe its justified How did you get that edge so sharp Thanks Neighbor very impressive Its true were beautiful yet deeply divided just like the grand canyon Ive hiked down into the grand canyon As an  year old I definitely would recommend doing it at least once Youve captured the essence of everything we put into our tourism TV adds which we play on your networks lol And this is why we all love Canadians I love painting keep up the good work Omg its completely wrong You forgot to paint the other countries orbiting us Ugh Never in my life have i see such bullshit as a Murican Ugh Awesome Really cool to see someone outside the US who appreciates its natural beauty Looks great Im also Canadian and Im missing our neighbours to the North Alaska That

MAN to the first guy you see idc And then you show us  of the costume Come on dude Nice attempt Points you could improve on next year  Make it so your hair covers your right eye the pictures left eye more  You seem to have gone for an orange take moreso than a sultry redpurple take  Perhaps some hairdye or different hair care that makes it glossier Your hair fails to have the impact of the original and your own dress  The eyelids need more eyeshadow love somehow Perhaps it is even possible to have fake eyebrows on your forehead to really get that huge eyelids look  The dress also needs work Every single picture I see of her be it drawn or cosplayed has a snugly fitting dress that shows off the body The fit of this one is lacking  Where are the iconic purple opera gloves Outside of the picture or missing entirely Even though I say all those things negative things I do want to point out you are recognisable and did a decent job You are gorgeous and it definitely isnt bad for Halloween I do think that for it to end up on my front page on such a major sub the outfit should be better but it isnt like one can expect people to downvote a pretty individual on reddit anyway Well

thrift store The book title is Spiritually Anchored in Unsettled Times by Bruce C Hafen This really makes me wish I had a a bunch of cameras and a massive budget And I knew how to direct lol Id love a short scene Scene cuts in on a British frigate in foggy weather the captains tense all staff on deck guns ready but its business as usual They have sailed this route before this weather is not new to them Hardened sailors to the last of them but caution is still required Not a sound can be heard except the waves and wind Then out front a call a ship As it gets closer and becomes more visible the crew notice the sails are up no sign of life They draw along side it in eery quiet Not a soul on deck As the captain uses his spyglass to scan the deck he notices something As the realisation that the deck is awash with red comes to him and his crew further out in the distance a dark shape takes hold in the fog The stretched out silence is broken by an ancient tortured weathered scream One frightened sailor fires a volley without order a pause then suddenly a chain reaction of chaos unfolds The cacophony of cannons breaks the stagnant silence calls for order ring out unheard Fear festers and spreads through the ranks or was that madness The whispering of fear does not stop it seeps into their minds their death is inevitable it cannot be stopped It grows louder with every passing moment Sailors frantically open fire with their own rifles in a last ditch effort while others reload cannons like a well oiled machine some men scream and drive off the boat for any escape The dark shape advances unstopped As it gets closer a shape starts to take form in the fogIs is that face End of scene Is that the Demeter Can you fucking imagine how absolutely horrific that lifestyle had to be Lol Being on a ship in the s sounds about as terrible as it could get Its bad luck to be singin about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words The sky was grey and

them when she saw them under concrete After she put in an ambulance she said she wants meatballs and ayran So touchy moments probably I never forget this little champion RIP to the mother no one should grow up without the love of a mother Some answers and corrections First of all I need to correct her name sorry I was wronged by early news Her name is AYDA GEZGN  If you read her name and surname together it means Traveller at moon in Turkish She is a hero so it makes sense This is the moment they found her httpsimgurcomaUFuwbZhttpsimgurcomaUFuwbZ And this is a video showing the moment they found her httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvzKzQwjXeabchannelTGRTHaberTVhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvzKzQwjXeabchannelTGRTHaberTV Rescuers found Ayda Gezgin next to a sturdy dishwasher that apparently shielded her from the impact of the damage  Quote from CNN international Her father and brother were outside when the building collapsed She was at home with her mother Unfortunately her mother Fidan Gezgin couldnt make it They found her hours after Ayda she was lying besides her daughther under the rubble Im  sure she sacrified herself for Ayda Sleep well wonderful human being When they found her she smiled to her rescuers First thing she said was Mom I want my mom Her rescuers asked if she wants to eat she requested meatballs and ayran Turkish yoghurt drink I also heard that a  year old I believe Elif survived while her neighbor also named Elif but  didnt make it This implies theres people out there who have been suffering for  days but wont make it in the end Im so happy to see Ayla and Elif Having worked at the  earthquake epicenter I saw thousands die and very few get pulled out like these two I know they will feel if every time another quake kills turks for no other reason than greed This is a miracle Alhamdulillah That poor girl I hope her life from here on out is everything she wants it to be This is a guaranteed life long severe PTSD but Im happy she made it Oh my goodness Im so sorry Ayla Im so sorry that you had to become a fighter you had to live under that block over nearly  day Im so sorry that they realized you alive after they smelled your decay of your dead mother Im so sorry for not just because of the earthquake That contractor who made you fight to survive Im so sorry for you had to growing up without your mother Im so sorry for For the politicians turning you into a hero to cover their crimes Im so sorry These people that keep getting rescued are they in like a small protected pocket where they can move around I just assumed theyd be buried with maaaaaybe some wiggle room but she looks fairly untouched Even Elif aside from her eye she looked in really good condition Completely miraculous This story is the hope that motivates fruitless hours spent searching through rubble The rescue workers who pulled her out said she grabbed his finger and didnt let go when he picked her up The loss of her mother will be devastating I cant imagine the toll it takes on a young child The first thing I thought when I saw that headline was that I sincerely hope she lives a long and joyful life maallah As a widowed father I feel for them all Cant recall the last time I read some good news here Thousand yard stare Poor kid I cant imagine the fear she must of felt Poor child Is it just me or has this earthquake not been reported on at all in the US I know we have an election going on but come on HerehttpswwwredditcomrTurkeycommentsjnfcdCBCnyadakitCBCmkCBfteayranlarsanakurbanolsunutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf a video of her asking for food specifically meatballs and ayran buttermilk Wonderful news What a little champion she is Lucky and brave little girl  Ayla means moon in Turkish if anyone was wondering Welcome to the most virtual version of the hell Earth God Bless her Poor girl Traumitized from being trapped And now without the love of a mother Absoululy no one should grow up without a mother So small but a great fighter already It makes me happy she made it but sad the family has no mother anymore I wish all the best to her her brother and her father Idk if anyone said this but the first thing she wanted was to eat meatballs and tons of people ordered meatballs to the hospital she was in Thats wholesome Is it just me or is it wrong to be plastering pictures of this poor traumatized little girl all over the internet She cant possibly have consented to this They say it is   but it is obviousIthttpsobviousIt is  or even more While were busy arguing over wearing a mask actual heroes are doing heroic things with little to no concern for their own well being Its nice to be reminded that selfless sacrifice still gets some love on a Internet full of influencers trolls and outright liars for a cause Hoping this little girl makes a full recovery and finds some happiness in her future Mashallah Ayla in the Earths Children series was found by the Clan after an earthquake and left the Clan after another earthquake to find her people Little Ayla may your journey be safe and emerge triumphant What a little badass I have a  year old daughter I cant imagine I was in that city no more than a year ago O RIP to all those who have lost their lives this is horrible Thank god shes ok She must have been terrified I was in istanbul when this happened and I can tell you that there was a huge lightning bolt that happened and then we felt a little shake Yayyyyyyy Ayla is tough as nails bro Meanwhile my  year old was bitching and freaking out about not getting another piece of candy last night What a legend Ayla is Question Why werent the buildings made to be antiseismic Samos got  causalties around  injured and only some buildings suffered serious damage but most survived And then in Turkey the earthquake killed  people injured more than a thousand and a lot more buildings got destroyed Didnt the government calculate for the Aegeans intense earthquakes that happen from time to time Theres something about these horrific crisis pictures Almost always the victims has this same look  Fuck My dads side of thw family lives here This is so amazing Poor thing Okay am I the only one whos read Clan of the Cave Bear and found this incredibly ironic and tragic  God Bless her That kid look shook Those IV fluids must have felt amazing after hrs Amazing this puts a smile on my face  I

they later come out and say that she was actually  years old and named Ayda not Ayla Poor girl one of her siblings died out of the  found Stay strong little lady God bless her and the folks that saved her deleted Clan of the Cave Bear Is it bad that my first thought was wow now she has a college essay Shell get in anywhere Watching the videos of the moments right before she was taken out of the rubble were so heart breaking Ayla is blessed to have survived for  hours in there Unfortunate that her mother didnt make it Poor kid hope she has a long life Ayla Thats the main character in Jean Auels Clan of the Cave Bear The main character survives a cave lion attack at  She looks like her too Damned awesome Thank you rescuers Hope Those eyes have seen some shit already Yo lil Turkish girls are hard af Precious girl  What a star Does she has a clawlike scar on her tight Jesus So was she under all the rubble for  hours Why do people down vote stories like this They said she was  in the news I hope she will be fine now i bet shes cold and shivering from shock Strong little angel Bless this girl and people who saved her and any other life She kind of looks like Marisa Tomei Oh my fucking god i cant even fathom how scared she must have been That poor sweetheart Im so glad they rescued her Oh man that must have been a real treat for the rescuers Days solid theyve been working hope dwindling then to pull that adorable little girl out and shes ok what a great feeling that must have been I have a  year old daughter and she looks so much like her This hits me hard man What an angel hopefully she recovers fully from any injuries quickly and can be with her family in safety Darn man thats good for her I learned her mother didnt make it out later on that must be saddest thing Like thats too early for her man she is only  So brave All the best to all of you Grateful for this today Poor kid stronger than I would have been in that situation Odd this is the first time I am

turkey Izmir egal She looks beautiful for deleted removed Great that Turkey had this fluff piece ready to go to distract from all the other people dying This is heartbreaking Im happy she is doing okay it must have been terrible to be trapped there I just wish the Turkish government wasnt so racist towards other nationalities Because of them young kurdish greek and armenian souls have suffered and are still suffering This should be a wake up call for them A life is a life Stop the racism Turkey She looks disgusted at the fact that a earthquake hit removed removed It looks like she wanted to die Parent I want my life to mean something not be alone when Im old Kid Meanwhile they probably still kill innocent people in Kurdistan Turkey is heinous Dont forget it This reminds me of the picture

this once in High School I had a teacher tweed jacket and bifocals kind of guy who had had back surgery years earlier so he carried his books and materials around on a little hand cart and always bent over a bit He was often late had this really particular slow way of speaking like the teacher in Ferris Bueler I came into the class dressed like him pulling books behind me dressed in tweed And as I walked in pushed up the glasses bent partially over and said in the best voice as I could peopleuhpeoplequiet down please and sat behind his desk He burst out laughing and gave me his own cart to use

job on your garlic have you grown the music variety Now is the perfect time to plant it for a June harvest Idk why but I really like this guys posts without the sign I wouldve guessed blue man group Blue pumpkins are typically used for people who are prepared for nonverbal special needs children and adults during Halloween Trump is a lot like a Halloween jackolantern Orange on the outside hollow on the inside and needs to be thrown out in early November I absolutely love this shade of blue Idk what it is but its hands down my favorite color and whenever I see it in public it always grabs my attention Blue lives matter pumpkins Wow your neighbors are big supporters of cops everyone that sees this display from a distance s People have allowed political crudboth sides to consumepollute every aspect of their lives rredditmoment rpics will be hell on earth if trump wins a second term I will always maintain that politics of any kind has no business in Halloween Halloween is fun Politics is not Imagine having such a bad case of TDS that you go out of your way to paint a bunch of pumpkins blue make a professional quality vinyl sign to state why and then take a photo of said pumpkins and sign to post on the interwebs Fucking LOL Get in Were gonna go find who asked This is unhealthy Its good to step away from politics They really let him ruin a whole color for them Thats exactly the point of Halloween to make it about yourself and your political leanings Thank you for politicizing our fun spooky holiday where we dress up and get candy Edit misspelled our There we go again Had to ruin another fun thing with politics edgyme This is no better than the trump stickers on candy Halloween is for kids leave politics out of trick or treating Ive long been ready for rpics to change from a political cesspool where it feels like every other post on here is a orange man bad circle jerk for internet points and then get down voted to hell for disagreeing with them Imagine politicizing Halloween What a loser Haha orange man bad Imagine politicizing Halloween Orange man bad am I right guys hahaha good Reddit moment Hi reddit look at me with my popular opinion Orange man bad haha right guys I dont even like Trump yet I must applaud him for juicing every single second of attention and loathing from these types of folks They seriously cant focus on anything but him lmao Small pp energy Blue pumpkins have a specific meaning already Sooo TRUMP  This is how boomers start thinking blumpkins are blue pumpkins Imagine a person having such great influence over your thoughts that you feel the need to paint your pumpkins a different color to spite them Hey lets be dumb and bring politics into a holiday primarily for children They seem like annoying neighbors The next  years will be rough for your neighbors I think then Cringe turned up to  He believes Americans are really stupid enough to elect a corrupt senile communist as their president Going to see some smashing pumpkins after election day if Biden ever admits defeat Trump must go but Biden is not much better IDK why people lean into him like hes the white knight And coloring a fun holiday theme and making even that all about politics shows how blind the people in America are these days How small is your mind when you feel the need to politicize Halloween Its supposed to be about fun Blue Pumpkins Matter Only in America would people turn Halloween and pumpkins into political bs Lmao the USA is a shot show democrats are just imperialists swines there is no change Imagine being such a pussy that you cant have fun with Halloween anymore I am helping the cause by hitting the blue down arrow Imagine turning a childrens holiday political just because you dont like the man in charge Small dick energy On the contrary a blue pumpkin basket is a way of letting the candygivers know your child has autism and may struggle to communicate Just thought Id throw that out here even if its not necessarily related If you hate orange so much delete reddit Ngl im kinda digging the new blue pumpkins Orange man bad Forgot this sub was rliberalpics for everyone voting for biden who has screeched about trump being corrupt or racist youre fucking stupid biden is everything trump has been accused of and worse and theres evidence of it yall are willfully ignoring have fun voting for biden the segregationist Haha get it Trump bad for the th time Halloween is for  year olds who should not know about or give a fuck about presidential politics Lame Can we leave politics out of holidays Think we should just change the sub now Is it insensitive to first think  blue  contrary to orange  against Trump I scrolled down from the sign on the picture to the pumpkins and thought they actually went and painted them thats awesome Nice to see your neighbors supporting the police Hope they got  more years left in the tank Blue lives matter Cringe Ohhhhh because the orange man is bad This is so edgy Tell them to get ready for another  years I dont understand how it is possible to vote for a man like Trump Better get used to it Trump wins tomorrow They had to clarify why the pumpkins were blue so that their house didnt get firebombed by unemployed college students lol Omg I dont think Ive ever rolled my eyes that hard This is hilariously crazy Not enough Orange actually Bring on the cheetos and  more years Classic unbiased reddit HAHA ORANGE MAN BAD Wow thats so meaningful Im totally voting for sleepy Joe now Nope  more years ehm really Thats just petty What good will this do It just seems like virtue signaling This is stupid and obnoxious of your neighbors Halloween is mostly for children and yet they feel the need to bring politics into something fun Your neighbors sound very simple minded Good heavens Trump truly does live in peoples heads Welp hope their prepared for disappointment How you gonna make fucking Halloween political too I always wanted a blumkin great for the environment First it was annoying orange and now the president Im blue daba dee daba di Yellow for corny well i made the pumpkin blue because id never seen blue pumpkin before and I wanted to see one I think its a lovely blue pumpkin billy It took me way too long to rememebr what orange they might have had too much of xD I honestly thought it was cuz they were bringing awareness to releasing prisoners for minor crimes or something They are going to downvote anything Pretty interesting idea with that color your pumpkins look awesome Nice Blumpkins Blue lives matter baby Enough or orange  Dont upvote  Let at   changing infection to lifeblood nice Orange man bad huh They blue themselves Wait I thought blue pumpkins meant something else entirely like it means you have candy without peanuts or something omg you didnt have trick or treaters did you The parents would have said something right Catching on that thats not why you put up the blue pumpkins Im genuinely concerned and curious now or does blue pumpkins mean something else Change Bidens been in politics for almost  years and hes changed nothing If you think Biden is actually gonna change anything if hes elected youre either naive or extremely ignorant Except for the police That blue is bad Your neighbors Stunning and brave At least they realize theyll have blue balls after the election MAGA Poor thingsOrange Man lives rent free inside their heads Trump  Yeah fuck orange pumpkins Im ready for change every democratic politician before not facilitating any actual change I thought this was a NNN joke I would never promote blue balls rorangemanbad Oh ho what a unique take on these politics Ugh The american election is just as intrusive as Covid I dont get this post What orange thing made these people upset Let people live outside of politics Its a holiday Especially for kids thought this was rapexlegends Existence is pain I just wanna die blue for police oh no Why

Every Home Depot employee seconds this Trick r Treason Cmon man Blue pumpkins are actually pretty neat First thought I had was that they must support the purge Or was that only flowers Theyre probably racist cop supporters Careful with the blue Some caring citizen may think he supports law and order and vandalize his property Wow they must really hate the sun I was confused at first I thought OP

Ive looked at this for five hours now If thats not the UK then Ill eat my own face Me after buying my third cactus At first I thought this was two people photoshopped on to a stock photo They look like my neighbors who cut the lawn with scissors They wasted all that time making a stupid garden when they could have been freebasing crack cocaine and making REAL memories together smh An angry goose has entered the chat Honk This is up there for most British images ever I want to play mini golf there Honestly I dont like it Its just not my taste good for them though theyre hard work has produced something they enjoy Didnt even mow a checkerboard pattern in at  degree angles And not even a single albino peacock Low effort Get off my lawn you damn kids This is so beautiful and they look so happy  I lived in a Hoodish town when I was really young The whole area was poorly maintained and run down except for one house with a font and back flower garden a koi pond with a bridge immaculately painted house done in a soft yellow and a red picket fence I went back recently and the house looks like the rest of the neighborhood Rest in peace random person from the s who took care of their stuff As a gardener its nice but not actually too hard to tend That grass is great but has that horrid edge strip Keeps it neat but looks ghastly The shrubs are all very simple and nothing is that big If you want a garden like this its only a few hours a week to keep it nice It looks overly manicured like a plastic garden Give me a yard with wildflowers and natural look over this any day DINGLEBERG deleted Garden of betrayal from south park anyone My retired neighbour used to passive aggressively comment about how I didnt cut my lawn often enough etc I would just tell him that as a person with three jobs and two young children I dont actually give two shits about the length or colour of the grass on my property and that if he feels that strongly about it he can cut my lawn Eventually he moved out and then a really nice witch moved in I couldnt be happier Pacific NW also can look like this Has very similar weather compared to England Ooo look at the weird nub of grass next to the fence on the right Surprised not to see a cup on that green somewhere Old man gotta get that practice putt Im getting some Stan Lee vibes from that guy Anybody else Is that grass even real It looks too perfect Wow I just want to hit golf balls off of the lawn Ive been wondering what Stan Lees doppelganger has been up to Its for the greater good Zero games of wiffle ball can be played in the backyard This is probably what my HOA expects my yard to look like Just think of the epic croquet tournies Once had an elderly neighbor with a similar yard It was beautiful but she died her loser grandson moved in and it turned into a jungle within a month It brought her much joy while she was alive One of them gets sick for a bit and itll look a shithole Damn I admire the amount of hard work needed o keep it that way What a great garden I wonder what the water bill is like Roses are British thing Everyone I visit my bro in UK all the house garden are  Roses Always well manicured Love it Too bad Iron Man and War Machine destroyed it back in  It looks like the old western photos where the settlers wanted to show off what they had Same compositon and everything The shot with the family that pulled the piano outside springs to mind for some reason So beautiful Im jealous I wish I have that kind of esthetic sense to maintain something so beautiful I want to see this beautiful garden in person Its so perfect and the joy in their eyes says it all My doggies would love to run around and play in there For the greater good httpswwwredditcomrphotoshopbattlescommentsfrqfpsbattlethisoldcouple Looks like the garden from Supernatural that was an autistic mans heaven As a homeowner the amount of upkeep that this likely requires is stressing me out Very beautiful though Theyre actually in their s this garden just takes that much work We have no kids If you look hard enough youll see the Mexican hiding in the background Looks like they water the plants with the tears of millennials who cant afford home what a flex I know they put in lots of effort and all but I dont like it Our generation we need to plant some native plants and trees in our garden instead of these fake massive toxic lawns This older generation has set a bad example of how perfect fertilized water soaking lawns means prosperity udavidismpd goals maar dan meer fairytale garden Damn Dreams right here How much money does it cost to maintain landscaping like this I want to know what Im striving for Looks great for practicing putting if it is the right kind of grass Getting some UP vibes from this couple Bet they arent the ones that care for it I know a couple with a garden this nice They hire it done Thats not impressive thats just money speaking I dont know how they can keep it that nice at their age unless theyre taking credit for someone elses maintenance work Martha I told you they will never find the bodies here Amazing Two there are two rocks out of place Mah ha ha Looks like a mini golf course Wish I could have something like this some day Instead I got every bad thing possible all at once Real men have concrete and a trampoline Someone tell those jerks to get off the grass I think Id be afraid to get dirt on that garden Best way to leverage that retirement time I cant even keep my fucking room this organized Oh how I wish this was in my wheel house Damn Good for them I would not have the patience for maintenance this requires Something straight outta Gnomeo and Juliet They started it when they were in their early s removed Why do they look like giants GET OFF MY LAWN it looks like a mini golf course No lie thought it was a putt putt course They look like giants on a sic golf course Stan Lee Looking at this for me is the gardening equivalent of the uncanny valley Its a little too manicured for my tastes but props to the hard work Thats one way to keep busy during retirement Thats definitely a minigolf course That one asshole who walks right through the garden Incoming football over the fence Its mine now I was just hoping somebody would mention the leaf in the bottom left Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare lmao nice putting green Gnomeo  Juliet That man has one very long arm Immaculate Theres a stone or something on the lawn at lower left It was a dusty lot before lockdown I betkidding Way too neat I want to like it  Id love to love it but I cant Come at me bro Imagine how bad that will look  years after poppop kicks it To think they only have to pay once a month to keep it like this is amazing s They obviously have help At Bly one never leaves I see a murder hornet over there yaander Perfect old people hobby especially right now Sort of reminds me of a house sized Butchard gardens And all that rain helps a lot I feel bad for whoever has to mow that Immaculate my ass Theres a rock on the bottom left of the grass  now thats enough loitering for one day picture is done get back to gardening Id pay  bucks to play that mini golf course I dont see a place for them to sit and enjoy the fruits of their labors Am I full of shit or should there be casting a shadow I may regret this question Reminds me of the garden in that Southpark episodes where one of the boys is walking through conspiring and the old mans yelling get out of my garden If I remember correctly It was a game of thrones parody shutters violently in crime pays but botany doesnt We sure this isnt a Putt Putt golf course Irrigation goals I am so jealous Is that a pergola arch with a birdhouse turret tower on top Nobody mentioned the single leaf on the bottom left of the image on the grass yup Last summer we moved into a home that was being sold by a guy in his s who was an empty nester and widow He was the original owner of the house and so is virtually every neighbor of ours  so in other words I have a lot of neighbors in their s and s I cant believe how much time they all spend tending to their yards and gardens Ill mow the lawn regularly and pick weeds if they get out of hand but my neighbors are outside seemingly for hours every day just tidying up theirs yards But how do you mow it Shes gunna betray you I didnt know Austin had a wife Grandson got a drone  his bday But he has never walked on that grass Look but dont touch kinda like the who cover their furniture w plastic This is the dream Did anyone else immediately get the urge to knock them over and hide their glasses in that big bush this could be us but u playin  Top quality weed over there Its beautiful How Stan Lee ever got the time to work in this garden AND do all that drawing Ill never know Amazing I always wondered what a couples crucifixion would look like Is that the Garden of Andros Hes gonna betray you Theyre holding a giant invisible ball As a kid that spend some time in the UK these gardens are stupid Cant play football or any sports in them Plus theyre usually tiny Coming from a huge backyard in Australia to these things was disappointing As an adult now they look pretty cool Would sit out there and smash a few beers no problem IIRC this was voted the best lawn in the UK also It is featured on an episode of Gardeners World on BBC This seems like a good golf course Everytime I see a garden or open space like that I get insanely jealous Living in a small apartment for a ton of money gets to you The ultimate grandpama flex  It look Photoshop for me idk y So beautiful They clearly do not have dogs Damn the edge work on those lines fuckkkkkk Is it just me or do they look incredibly tall Are we sure thats not the garden from South Park Not to be a downer but theres something about immaculately manicured grass that just looks ugly Like bad astroturf Im sure the effort and skill it took to pull this off is impressive but I just dont think the look is worth it at all Dont show this to Melania Trump Repost Putt putt course potential rphotoshopbattle please I feel like I saw this in my dream Beautiful Now thats what my dream garden would look like If only I could get my hubby on board Ah So thats what real life garden scapes looks like Wow  Its probably a very good execution of the style they were going for But I dont like it It looks extremly artificial Now every garden is somewhat artificial but this looks like an attempt to completely oppress nature I want to golf there I want to practice my putting there Germany Did anyone else look around for hedges sculpted into various vulva Gardenscapes This was a good psbattle a few months ago imo it would be a good golf course or it kinda looks like a golf course OMGoodness Pretty sure I saw this in a movieand garden gnomes had battles when people werent looking Im  sure that garden is in Midsomer County Badgers Drift if I am not mistaken I think the houses so close together says it all More moss  The kind of garden that raises the price of the neighbours houses too Wow thats something to be proud of for sure That boarder to their our right looks abit disappointing Seems like a lot to maintain for two retirees Wonder if they have any hired help The fuck is that speck in the corner Wow Simply beautiful They look like the gardens in Victoria island in Canada Gosh that is very nice I wonder if they do all of the upkeep themselves and if they do how many hours a week it takes But who wears shoes on a lawn like that Damn wonder who theyre landscaper is What kind or reel mower they use We didnt burn him Really makes me think of that one episode from Goosebumbs the one with the lawn gnomes I mean thats a full time job for one right That is a dream garden Garden of Betrayal from South Park Is that a mini golf course That is simply spectacular These are my neighbors My yard looks like a dust bowl cornfield next to theirs They must be retired Thats the only way I can imagine someone having the time to keep that tight a line between the grass and the beds I agree with some of the other comments that its not my personal style but this is exactly the kind of backyard that my paternal grandparents had and this gave me a pang of nostalgia playing in their backyard as a kid when we would visit them  Thank you Nice to be rich It looks like a really small golf course I wonder what they be plotting while walking around that garden Gardening is certainly a labor of love at this level Glad they found something they enjoyed doing together Someone get these folks some cannabis seed I think itd work nicely along the white fence in the top left area and theyd do well with it Then I can show up mid Croptober to assist them in careful disposal Now thats a lovely putting green right there It looks like a putting green at a high end golf course GET OFF THE GRASS  That couple doesnt deserve to own that much property They probably built their wealth on the backs of the poor and downtrodden This is why we need a wealth tax to take away their property While people are starving in the streets these rich aholes are basking in their privilege Goals I wanna roll around on that fucker until it is done and android is working Monty would approve Thats begging for a few holes cut out of it Worlds prettiest putting green Fuck me the amount of time Terrible Sterile  Im tired of you kids coming to my garden and having talks of betrayal Fuck you dude this is the garden of Andros Incredible edging job  more like immaculate grass A mini Butchart Gardens Holy shit Looks like a level in Untitled Goose Game Fkn boomers Look at the size of that yard and they bought the house for k probably Every dog in the world Yeah Id definitely take a  there  It reminds me of the Gareden of Betrayal from the Game of Thrones South Park specials If the lawn didnt have stripes Id have thought it was turf Goals I want to smoke a bowl there and just eat pie Thats not real finally a place i can make alliances just so i can betray them in the end  Why does this look vaguely photoshopped Is that astroturf  Unpopular opinion time This yard looks super unnatural Would like it so much more if they had embraced local flora and focused on more naturaldynamic landscaping for example moss paths native plants less lawn  Lawns are terrible for the environment  Why is this in rpics Feels like an even lower standard than usual Like at least seeing strangers babies and wedding pics is still kind of nice This is just a random stock photo of two old people in a yard I dont get it It looks like a movie set I just want to take an afternoon nap on that lawn WOW I would want to have sex with my SO right there on that beautifully cut grass Too much lawn  This reminds me of the couple from the new Maisie Williams movie The Owners for a hot second i thought they were like  feet tall That pic is a photoshopped monstrosity So they have money to waste on a yard that they likely paid someone else to maintain while other people worry about rent  groceries Im not impressed Here is a funny short blog about taking pictures in daily life httpsbramblesandfunguscomcaptureeverymomenthttpsbramblesandfunguscomcaptureeverymoment Eric Cartman recites game of thrones in this garden Looks like they forgot to get a life Tons of work went in to that A mini Butchart Gardens  months of work wow Real animal crossing So much love and care went into this beautiful garden Willing to bet more then one complex chemical was used Such a worthy retirement hobby Immaculate Says who Immaculate would be a self sustaining permaculture This is a back yard that takes lots of money and maintenance Do any of these plant produce food or have a purpose or is it just a hobbyego garden They deserve a standing ovation This is gorgeous The amount of work damn My father has a lawn half its size and its a goddamn pain Perfect example of how too much landscaping makes things look unnatural and crappy If theyre free I have a garden Id love them to tend to this weekend This just looks tiring I need to sit down   Wow Correction their hired gardening teams garden The tits on that  Must be nice to own shit I can smell the miracle grow The chocolate bar makes this The court rules  in favor of naptime for

Fantastic the candy bar gave me a chuckle Omg stinking adorable  the baby Ruth touch is clever as hell So fucking weird Ruth BABY Ginsberg Ruth Baby Ginsburg Luv it  political clout post for internet points k upvotes  comments Anyone else starting to think all these RBG posts are being artificially inflated Yet another post where parents pimp their kids out for cheap political points Cringe I BET THAT BABY DOESNT KNOW WHO THAT IS raverageredditor Honoring the Notorious RBG in the most adorable way Win  No way Im giving a baby something that could get chucked at me like that I hope that child grows up to be a staunch conservative rwokekids edit got beaten to the Ruth Baby G Upvoting original haha just wait until you hit your s You will grow to love naps WILL YOU GOOD SIR BORROW THY GAVEL Out of the loop here What is the deal lately with dressing your kid as RBG judge Your honour the witness testimony clearly contradicts the evidence So creative with that matching candy bar Baby Ruth Your kid is so woke In terms of nap we have no nap Ruth Baby Ginsburg More like Ruth Bader Cutesburg  R Baby G only if your diaper would dissent Awwwww ITS A GGGGHOST Super adorable though Aww how adorable A mini RBG What a legacy Brilliant I keep seeing all these snarky woke kids comments about this pic Do these mental giants think anyone is claiming the baby requested this costume Do they think theres another costume that would have been preferred by a literal infant that probably lacks object permanence Are they going to start complaining about dog costumes because youre taking away the dogs agency Nice candy bar Its adorable how the little one has a whole full size candy bar  The chocolate bar totally made me get her costume A so darn cute This is a special kind of stupid My niece seconds the motionhttpsiimgurcomupEdDHjpg A supporter of Roe v Wade Im sure AWESOME LIFTED MY SPIRIT in this dark time  Soooooo many bitter people in these comments absolutely disgusting reyebleach worthy I have no objection your honor You people are so weird This is the second RBG costume Ive seen on here You probably started caring only after she was gone The Baby Ruth chocolate on the table is genius Not needed but genius Daily reminder judges are not supposed to be political that is the whole point of their job so elevating a judge that explicitly and continuously went outside of the scope of their job to do their job is probably not a smart standard we want to encourage RBG didnt die she just was resurrected like a phenix Ruth Baby Ginsburg Kinda cringe why do you do this to your kids kids have no place in pushing politics Why would you dress a baby as a judge Fuck RBG Ha A baby Ruth with a Baby Ruth deleted Baby Ruth Ginsberg Omg Id rather your baby was on the Supreme Court as opposed to the pack of ghouls we have now Maybe dont post pics of your children on the internet where creeps can you know Are the internet points really worth it Only scary for conservatives Poor kid This is the first time I felt like a baby is cute Loveeeeee  Brilliant  haha thats cute Is her name Ruth  Ok now that is adorable Awwwdorable This is awesome Nice bribe Finally dressing up as real superheroes Can we all just agree that this wins Halloween The layers to this picture Bravo Parents Awesome planning The candy put it over the top This kid just won Halloween Ginsburg would have supported this cutie being vaccublended out of the womb in little red bits  pieces Imagine doing this to your baby to farm karma on reddit haha rfuturescarredadults Cringe ah the irony Looks like shes sitting in a foreman grill  How ironic Scary zombie  My daughter begged to be RBG for Halloween What a natural feminist At least this one is just cute and not cringe Quit I guess shes one of the lucky ones that survived her decisions Aww is she Amy Coney Barrett So cute making your baby a political prop nice Very ironic to dress a baby up as RBG considering her stance on abortion specifically postbirth abortion Unbased and bluepilled Looks like abuse Democrats are the party of CRINGE Judge judy Cute Ghost Is the gavel there so she can smash the baby ruth Since she loved killing babies But

I love it Everything about it is spot on Aww and Lucy is such a sweet person I was gofer at a con one year their entire group was at Hercs too she and the actress who played Gabby were so polite and made a point of smiling at folks in the back halls as they moved from wherever to wherever stopped to say hello if you wanted Some of the others who will remain nameless not so much Maybe they were just tired and cranky though which is why they will remain nameless LOL But Lucy was sweet I keep hoping for a feature film of Xena Lawless would have to get a cameo for a new generation And just like that lesbians across the world bite their lower lips as they remember their youth when they watched Xena and understood they liked women ririnemeier Spot on cosplay Way better than when I was  and stuck balloons down the front of my Xena Halloween costume I need to hear her battle cry Nice I had a girl crush on her and Gabrielle YIiiYEE YEE YEEEEEE I dont think thats a cosplayer I think that is

I saw it in theaters with my grandma and that was special too Seeing Jeff like this reminds me that he wont be here forever either I knew he was my favorite but I didnt know Id be this level of sad seeing him go through this is that an external pacemaker on his right Ive never seen one on the right but its huge whatever it is Either that or an internal defib device It cant possibly be a mediport

feel like that one IV bag is actually full of whiskey Ghoulish greetings rpics patron Have you heard about our spooktacular Halloween Photo Contesthttpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsjbgtgyenterthepicshalloweenphotocontest I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorpics if you have any questions or concerns Im disappointed that no one so far cosplaying as this couple bothered with the mustard stain I love how limp wristed she holds the pistol Wheres the mustard stain Laziest Beetlejuice costume Ive ever seen Im out of the loop can someone fill me in Apparently Reddit is totally cool with whiteface So just asking is it racist for a African American to do white face Seriously just asking if its only racist for one side Im not offended as a white person Just more asking out of curiosity Had to come to the comments to realise theyre in white face All I saw was THIIIGGGHHHHSS Sorts by controversial My culture is not your costume I think shes missing the food stains on her shirt Damn she got some Pixar Mom vibes Isuh  is that white face I almost forgot that black people cant be racist s Reddit has become a means to incite racial tension This is one of many posts that do this We are all one Is that white face  Would have been funny without the whiteface Just kinda a unnecessary touch Where are the stains on the ladies shirt Clearly Im missing something can someone enlighten me Yeah this isnt okay either Jesus Christ if a white person did that oh cool so i guess whiteface is okay with reddit If you had shoes on then you FAILED  Hmmm Im conflicted The costumes and props are on point but I dont know how to feel about the face paint I think that the same humorous impact could have been made with just the wig I feel that instead of laughing at the joke much of the conversation is going to be on the morality of white face Surprised its not slutty mccloskeys Wonderful Responding to racism with racism isnt a thing to be proud of Im sorry Isnt the whole whiteface a tad racist If we would turn the race around this would have exploded The bitter irony of this is that theyre more likely to be shot by police than the real couple with real guns These comments confirmed the hypocrisy I believed existed Apparently racism only works one way  Customes would have been just as great without the facepaint But the way shes holding the gun Classic Good thing shes not the PM of Canada might get in trouble for that white face make up Awesome Why is it OK for black people to do white face but wrong if white people do black face Non American asking deleted Whiteface ok  Uhwhat the fuck is this shit Wait so white face isnt racist Lmao ok Its surprising how many people commenting are saying that the fact she has painted her face white is just funny and are saying here come the fragile redditors to comment about it  if this was reversed and a while person had black face for Halloween would people say the same Would it just be funny  Would the people who comment about it just be fragile  The hypocrisy is unbelievable I dont know how these people did not get in trouble for pointing their guns Fuck outta here with that racist white face bullshit Great costumes but i feel like putting on white face makeup shouldnt be a thing This is sad arent things like this reason why is black face racist So tell me how this isnt Im here for it Horrible trigger discipline just like the originals Moments before disaster Oh yah Im sure its already been said but WHERE IS THE LADYS MUSTARD STAIN Why is this cropped so badly Explain please Hell of a time to be walking around with a prop gun Real American heroes This is an article on minstrel shows and black face httpswwwamericanheritagecomblackfacesadhistoryminstrelshows Black face has a pretty bad history here in the states and theres still a lot of baggage associated with it The difference between white and black face is the history Far be it from me to tell someone not to be offended by whiteface but the historical racism can explain why one is much more controversial than the other That girls hips tho wtf she looks like a fucking pear Thats really racist with the whiteface I really dont know how this goes through someones head to the point they think this is ok or somehow less racist because its whiteface Is whiteface racist Im a white guy and I dont think so This is absurdly racist and they both need to be fired from their jobs and publicly shamed Fucking racists doing white face Hey tea this is kettle Youre black I guess this means blackface is back on the menu How dare you appropriate my culture White face Thats racist People get mad at white people for doing black face but that the other way around iTs NoT rAsCiSt iF YoUr bLacK why is whiteface ok and blackface is not Serious question How is it okay for her to be white faced idk prob the fact it has hypocrisy written all over it Nothing like racism Omg this is the best Hah lovin all the variations of this thats popping up Im not dressing up this year but thought about next year being a Cheeto dressed in a business suit As a white dude Im not offended in the slightest but that whiteface is pretty hypocritical if one assumes they would have a problem with blackface And sure the historical context matters but either youre striving for equality or youre not and either racial caricatures are acceptable within reason or theyre not I dont see how setting double standards is going to help the cause for racial unity Youre just creating two separate cultures this way Now i will preface this with the fact that i am of Carribbean heritage before any rabbitholes are jumped down Is it ok for asian people to do black face or white people to do yellow face is it only different if white people who likely have likely very little knowledge let alone seen a black and white minstral trype production do it to black people You are  correct on the historial contextpresident but we have to be realistic here It has to be an all or nothing approach either altering the colour of your skin to represent a different race is blanket not OK or it is otherwise you are treating people differently based on the colour of their skin As a black man and i very clearly dont speak for everyone i dont see the issue in modern times I have seen black face and white face many times and never was it used in a dimmunitive way aside from the actual minstral productions just used to more accurately portray the person they were dressing up as There were maybe fringe cases where it may have been unnecessary but nothing overtly racist The historical context is there yes and was undeniably awful but im wondering nowadays how much is the fact people are conditioned to react that it is a bad thing and offensive when it is not indended to be this case included  Are they using colour of skin to actilvely mock a particular race  Are they using makeup to replace the need to hire a person of a particular race Those are actually two pretty important tests arguably i would say that aside from the obvious hideous past in current times most cases we see of colour face do not actually fail either of these tests More seen as racist because doing this sort of thing was outlandishly racist  years ago She had to wear whiteface Shes holding a toy gun in public what if a cop saw her Im offended by whiteface She must lose her career friends possibly even her home I demand an immediate apology Antiwhite and liberal reddit I dont know how this ends up progressing HAlarious Meanwhile how long until this thread gets locked down             I love it But is it ok for black people to do white face Again Love it Im all for non PC costumes But ya Seems super hypocritical with how people throw a fit when some white girl dresses as a geisha Ill get blasted for this and its a genuine question but if black face is not ok why is this ok For the record I agree blackface is not ok in the same sentence I dont agree with a retroactive cancelling of it being done in days gone Does anyone understands how racist this actually is Bitch is in white face Its so fucking hypocritical its pathetic So whiteface is ok Racist af Soooo is white face acceptable So Reddit promotes black racism and not white racism Cool Im against both and feel like this shit needs to be taken down What a double standard shitbag social media site this is And thats how the dumb stay dumb kids lol get rid of racism WITH more racism lol if you cant learn from history just repeat towards others Is she doing white face  That seems pretty racist Regardless of what side of the political spectrum you are on we really shouldnt demonize people for protecting their property against trespassers Edit we Daymn Them thighs too good of a trigger discipline White face Seriously Is that white face Good stuff but I fear for their lives tbh Exactly the opposite emotion I had for the real couple even though they actually brandished deadly weapons Only white people are racist huh Uhhhhh white face is allowed How is white face not at the top How rude of her Cancel her and make her lose her job Is it acceptable to put on whiteface I get so confused nowadays She thikk like cold peanut butter I like this picture But not for the white face Thats a bit racist Sorting by controversial is exactly what I thought it would be Isnt that white face If this doesnt count then black face is free game Im extending my Halloween Lol Is she wearing white face Someone please explain how this is not considered racist but blackface is Sigh why you got to be so racist America Im fed up of having racial double standards shoved down my throat Yo WTF now you are doing whiteface Whiteface lmao Is this not whiteface Lmao this while thread is rfragilewhiteredditor material  so a black person can literally paint their face white and that is perfectly okay  xB this is insanely hypocritical For real whats with the double standard Shes got white makeup on her face If that was a white person doing black face there would be next level outrage Im all about equal rights but that means EQUAL Halloween be bringing the joy for  White people WHiTE fAcE Is RaCiSt  Mimes Well fuck Whiteface is just as racist as blackface If one cant be done then no to all White face really Something to be said here but Ill see my way out Needs more Paunch I get the historical context of black face and recognise that that was wrong What I dont get and I think its unfortunate is that the sensitivity about it prohibits an actorcosplayerhalloween costume from reaching what the true aim is Like If I wanted to really impersonate the likeness of Donald Trump i would alter the color of my skin to a shade of orange so that I look more like him Right If I want to be Thanos I can paint my face purple In the same way if I wanted to look like Barack Obama I would WANT to make my skin darker to look more like him but I cant do that because it is taboo It has nothing to do with the historical legacy of blackface the intention wouldnt be making fun of black people or culture is that that is what Obama looks like I can change my hair and facial hair to look like a character or celebrity but not the skin I wonder if there had never been a tradition of the problematic vaudeville style blackface and the like we would be able to freely color our skin ITT  Racists defending her racist whiteface costume Whiteface Is she in whiteface Thats a fake booty baby I dont get it I think white antiBLM would have been more offended if she didnt do the whiteface They nailed it       The raisins stay in the potato salad Carol Is that really a costume or did you just take a picture of your american neighbors having a chat I feel like that couple fell off the face of the earth once they spoke at that rally No I have a sense of humor and the world would be a much better place if everybody learned to laugh a little instead of trying so hard to be offended They were shot by police officers shortly thereafter Is that guy in whitebeard What the fuck White face Ok Isis that whiteface Lmao Is she in white face Is that cool can we do that Wait Never mind I dont get it Cmon guys this is clearly a PR stunt for White Chicks  Why be racist to be somebody who was defending their property they could have done it better sure Whiteface Really Thats acceptable and blackface is not How isnt this shit racist Yet IASIP is getting shows pulled Isnt this reversed blackface or blacks can do anything and other cultures cant Isnt that means that blacks nowadays simply have more rights than anybody FRAME MY RESPONSE WITH THIS IN MIND I AM A RED BLLODED REPUBLICAN RETIRED MILITARY AMERICAN WHITE MALE Reading the comments on this thread makes me sad for humanity Im conflicted about how to feel about this for two reasons First feelings dont really matter they just get in the way of fact At first I thought this was JUST hypocritical which by definition it is but second I ALSO think is is fucking hilarious and RIGHTEOUS I spent over  years in the military to fight for EVERYONE to have the right to Freedom of Speech The beautiful and creative way of these two are expressing their feelings about what is going on in our nation by exercising their Godgiven freedoms is something that everyone should emulate I have a problem with people criticizing their choice to exercise their rights You dont have to like it You dont have to look at it No one cares about you opinions just like no one should really care about mine I will say this though If you are so fragile a snowflake that this sets you off you probably shouldnt be navigating the internet to begin with because it is full of triggers Leave now before you head explodes Excellent costumes BTW Wheres the mustard Vr Brutalbyte an eye for an eye seems like a healthy attitude for social growth and understanding Its a very modern concept  people endorsing whiteface The only people offended sympathize with the racist fucks these people are parodying This costume is awesome This bitch really out here wearing white face deleted So going white face is ok Hmmm Interesting white face is acceptable Well looks like black face is free game Im extending my Halloween Go wild everyone Is she doing what ever is opposite of black face  I thought racial face painting was discouraged Is she really in white face How dressing in black face racists but dressing in white is not To say whiteface is funny but blackface is racist is bullshit yet another instance of its ok to be racist against white people but not black people ITT People who are offended by something that has no effect on their lives Stop making stupid people famous is the quote How do you think we got into this mess in the first place Imitation is for of flattery  and this couple the original nasty one does not deserve to be imitated how did we become so dumb Theyll get shot on the street by cops for holding guns I found this one funny Creative costume Its the McCloskeys Oh fuck hahahahah The Rich must pay more The new white chicks movie lookin fire  Am I the only one feeling a little concerned for their safety Historically speaking holding fake guns hasnt worked out for a lot of black people Id feel really bad upvoting this today and then reading about the matched the description of a suspect story tomorrow Soy face is in No double standard Got it You just make yourself look stupid when you condemn something but do it yourself Why is shit like this always top on this sub People hella butthurt about her makeup  I dont get why she even needed whiteface we would have gotten the memereference anyway I admit the couple did a very funny job with this pic BUT mocking these people ads to the fame infamy they continue to receive from their racist and dangerous stunt Keeping them in the limelight like this will probably earn them money from speaking engagements endorsements etc from the farright propaganda machines too I just want to point out the bitter irony of white people complaining about white face as if the rules of polite society are supposed to be applied equally and fairly What else is supposed to be applied equally and fairly Mmm but whiteface kinda ruins it White face is not ok White face is ok not racist One should have also had a little lizard on their shoulder and the other should have had a little general What are you wearing Jake from state farm cute couple Jake seems like a pretty laid back guy He goes with the Flo Nice My parents did this one yearhttpsimgurcomaDGXLqk only it was before the Jake from State Farm thing really took off so my dad was Mayhem instead These pop up ads are getting super sneaky and super annoying Is this ad or halloween costume How much did you get paid to post this A forbidden love story Wait its all car insurance Always has been sir shoots me a three year coverage plan Paging Rhailcorporate No one wanted to be a giant gecko Lol I wonder if the original Jake from State Farm is pissed or traumatized that State Farm made a whole campaign out of the Jake from State Farm character but replaced him with a younger and better looking Jake Plus they also gave the new Jake a much better personality who gets tons of admiration from his customers including lots of famous people We condone quite a crazy world Weve been indoctrinated with advertisements to such a degree of normalcy well even dress up as them for Halloween All they needed were a duck and a little lizard And they would be perfect Ad hail corporate Amazing choice You both look great Should have rented a gecko Lmao This is awesome Plot Twist They actually work for statefarm and progressive Now I want to see a limu costume How many times was Jake asked what he was wearing Lol great costumes I can imagine many arguments at the dinner table with these two oh man this is the crossover episode we need We know a thing or two because weve seen a thing or two If you are actually agentsthat would be even more

missing to this day There was a story on FB recently about a woman who was shushed by her husband while she was in labourthis guy is with him You should have not done this This picture is brought to you by a future dead man who once thought he was funny My father wasnt there while my mother was in labor Oh he wanted to be but hed recently eaten a meatball sandwich with a lot of garlic on it and my mother made him wait outside the door Nah Im pretty sure thats a DiVorce Edit I think this is my first reward  thank you so much  Edit  you guys are too awesome thanks again for the rewards  Wife is terribly suffering Guy hey hold still Reddit is gonna love this lol ima get so much gold uhhh i hope the lady giving birth actually wants this pic out in the world kind of a personal moment there I ate a honey bun in front of my wife while she was in labor Didnt think much of it really It was late and I was hungry I will never ever never make that mistake again Thats not very cash money of you This pic is to be used court at trial for her justifiable homicide Clearly he deserved it You sir are a monster The last thing i wanted to do while the wife was in labor was eat What a helpless feeling i had Her pukimg in a trash can from the pain Then the delivery What a disgusting experience It wasnt awesome until they laid my daughter on my wifes chest and she instantly stopped crying and was just looking at me Everything before that was not enjoyable Especiqlly when the Dr said he was sending us home because she wasnt dilated enough I had  pages of documentation i took theoughout the day to include times her contractions started how long they lasted and when they picked up again We are the only ones in triage Doc She just threw up and cant walk to the car He looked at the records and said impressive Said we had another hour  mins later her water breaks which i guess was really fucking painful for her I then spent  mons trying to find some fucking help Yeah I dont want to experience that again His last meal Hospitals should have a delivered in  minutes or its free policy Never eat food in front of your partner while she is in labour  she forgiven you yet  I want to punch you for her haha Ugh I feel this photo Having a burger queued up for my wife right after our second child arrived was maybe the greatest husband move Ive ever pulled off My ex husband brought pizza into the delivery room Were divorced because he was cheating on me but this picture just made me realize I have more bitter feelings about the pizza My husband ate Wendys while I was in labor The nurse scolded him Is this supposed to be funny Seems pretty disrespectful Man really going to lengths to get internet points bud weird this is like tv comedy that just doesnt translate into real life Cruel and unusual punishment for the wife Oh thats delivery alright I love me some Marcos but I hope that woman never finds out he posted this pic on the internet thats a big DiGiorNO If this is OPs photo I would just like to take a moment to say that youre a piece if shit for posting this If I did this my girl would get up and make me wish that I was in labor As a midwife I want to punch all dadspartnersfamily that eats in front of a laboring mom rtrashy Read his full story tomorrow on rtifu Man my first birth was a failed induction at  weeks pregnant after  days of labor What i remember most was how amazing the the soup was Or Broth I guess Freaking liquid diet  Some people Jesus man put your phone down Block this dumb ass Ive never seen someone commit suicide on Reddit before Imagine hating your wife this much Dudeits delivery httpswwwmarcoscom Its one thing to take the photo but the balls to put it online is a whole different level AITA for eating pizza leisurely in front of my pregnant wife in labour You sir are an ass Noits Marcos Pizza it says so right on the box rarethestraightsOK Thats messed up I would have killed my husband for eating a pizza while I labored Are you siriusly eating pizza while you gffianc is in labor exemplary photo of what parenting is like as a woman consumed with pain worry your future child etc while all this dude can do is think about himself and what hes eating This is so horrible What kind of person do you have to be to be able to watch someone close to you in agony while casually eating a pizza Then on top of that post a picture of her exposed writhing in pain to the internet Some men truly have no empathy or decency No officer I didnt see her murder him Its not that he is eating in front of his suffering wife Its that she cant eat anything but ice chips through the ENTIRE birthing process Such a cunt this husband is rtrashy Nope Pretty sure thats delivery Im not sure Ive ever seen such a fundamental lack of respect displayed towards a loved one in one photo quite like this Dude whoever took that picture is a massive asshole Who brings a pizza into a room with a laboring woman who cant eat She looks miserable and hes stuffing his face Ugh  What kind of psychopath cut a pizza like this   She would have every right to be pissed Who the fuck eats pizza cut into squares I wouldnt want someone like that raising my kids Not often you see the joke someones thought of for  months Who cuts pizza like that Your going to pay for this joke for years this is how men get their ass beat What the fuck dude What a great picture Just know your wife will never ever forget this moment nor secretly forgive you and you can expect this moment to come back to haunt all of your happiness from your life with greater condemnation in about  to  years Good Luck  my wife almost ended me when she caught a whiff of pizza on my breath in our first delivery This guy Now thats cold She cant eat shes in labor I had to go  days without eating due to my induction not working next day having the baby late in the day and then having complications right after which I had emergency surgery so it was sometime late on the third day that I finally got to actually eat My husband and Mom both knew Id kill them if they ate in front of me during that time What a great Marcos ad The many many ways in which you will come to regret this moment may not fully make themselves known for years or even decades to come I would actually kill you and not put your name On the birth certificate This is so fucked up Monster Dont be eating while shes giving birth Is not DiGiorno its divorce This man deserves nothing but death A cruel death I would divorce you for that This is a accidental renaissance painting Bro you are never going to live this down RIP But DiGiornio is a frozen pizza Its divorce She hits the transition stage and hes gonna be wearing that pizza like a bonnet But it also isnt digiorno Thats not DiGiorno its delivery Later he can joke about how hes pregnant with a food baby Shell love it Prepare to die Your wife You Sir are an ass Bro shes probably about to crap herself and youre in there eating pizza Youre a shit person Whats even worse youre procreating I love Marcos pizza Honestly fuck you dude Pay your respects to this young lad Went missing shortly after this photo was taken F Women if you decide to have children choose your coparent wisely It will be the most important decision you ever make I cannot stress this enough Even if she were to leave this relationship she will still be tethered to this narcissistic cocksucker for the next  years If her child decides to give her grandchildren he will be a thorn in her side for life She will never be rid of him Jesus fucking Christ But theres nothing but delivery in this picture Marcos pizza is by far the best pizza  But it is delivery in both cases I ate cold pizza after my son was born its the first and only time I have voluntarily but Id been up for  hours at that point and hed had a difficult birth and ended up in the NICU I had other things on my mind than how much I hate cold pizza My wife who did all the work of course ate a nice hot meal brought by the hospital and she earned it  BascomWinnie Palmer have the best hospital food Ive ever seen kudos to them Funny the things you remember No way thats a shitty overpriced digiorno Id be throwin every thing I could think of at him and take the pizza for later Baby after born is it for me Cold Blooded Its Marcos Tragically the photographer has never been seen again Thats Marcos This guy has been sitting on this joke a long time My familys story is when my mother went into labor the car would not start So naturally my father got a friend to drive my mother to the hospital and started to fix the car Different times the s You gonna die I also choose this guys hot slice Mine spent most of my labour talking to the various midwives we had about motor sport  its all a blur now but I remember that well I was like er hello Im trying to push a person out of me here Pepperoni and jalapeno The best possible combination of pizza toppings Its clearly delivery and not digiornos I showed up with McDonalds to the hospital when my wife was delivering because I thought oh crap this could be a long time I better get something to eat Never lived it down yet and that was  years ago Butits clearly not Digiorno Bbbut it was delivered Looks like Marcos Im guessing that pizza was his last meal Man I would have been very upset if this had happened to me Its Marcos FUCKING pizza and we all know it Fucking savage bro S many negative comments yet over k upvotes The world is truly diverse You know if she doesnt deliver in under  minutes you dont have to pay any money for himher RIP OP Its like no one has actually been in a delivery room before nor knows how long the process goes for and that this is a joke I feel the discomfort displayed on the laboring mama on such a deep level Labor can be a long process I have no issue with papa eating during labor but something as stinky as pepperoni and jalapeno pizza would have pissed me off Unless this is her idea of aromatherapy I would suggest a different scent to fill the room with I was allowed to eat until I was in active labor as displayed in the photo and by that time I had zero interest in eating I also brought food in my bag to sneak just in case it became necessary Also to all the women who werent allowed to eat during their labors Im sorry And yes I know there are medical reasons why hospital staff wont let folks eatI still disagree with the blanket practice that seems to happen for so many people Dude those are very nice looking slices of pizza A true legend amongst men and other creatures Actually its Marcos One day will see the revenge picture of his vasectomy His face is still on the pizza box missing man Last seen at the hospital Omg I felt this lol My labor nurse had to yell at my husband to put down the food and his phone so he could hold my leg while I pushed  If this doesnt lead to attempted murder I dont know what will I calculate about  years worth of sleeping on the couch for THIS stunt Oh honey thats disgusting Im eating here Brave My better half would have gotten out of the bed and beat me with the pizza Lol She was so hungry She is still pissed at me for not sharing my skittles  years later Enjoy the divorce homie Theyre both delivery Its not delivery is Divorceeo Lol  the smell of hot pepperoni and afterbirth is said to be an aphrodisiac  Do they allow you to take food inside Its gonna smell like poop in there pretty soon Bold move So disappointed in my boner right now People who cut pizza like this should be buried  meters underground Damn bro The smell of those jalapenos My wife would have straight up murdered me Who cuts a pizza into squares like that Absolutely barbaric You know as a woman who spent  hours in labor There isnt much else for him to do He gets hungry I was hungry too and wanted the big mac he was eating but I couldnt eat What was I going ng to do say he couldnt eat either That pizza looks like shit You suck Hope you end up being a better dad than partner Fucking legend Babe you suuuuure you dont want a slice of this bomb pizza Alrighty then Except its actually delivery C section is the DiGiorno of child birth Because its not delivery buts still going to smell like delivery Nick Thune Thats delivery DiGiorno doesnt come in a box like that Dude I could tell that was a marcos pizza before I even saw the box I worked there for years when I lived back east in Toledo Is this in Texas Jalapeos on a pizza feels like a Texas thing to me  At first I read your username as PubicMaster Mmm Pepperoni and jalapeno At least his last meal was pretty good What animal cuts a pizza is squares At least its not ham and pineapple isnt that delivery tho But that is Marcos pizza it says it right on the box Thats obviously not DiGiorno Its not DiGiorno its the Last Supper Did the guy offer some to her Pizza would probably make giving birth a little easier Night before my wifes labor I snuck in Barqs and good beef jerky She didnt think it was very funny when I started cutting the pizza and said I was giving it an episiotomy Kono digiorno giovana wa yume ga aru Oh my God What on earth  Ooh thin crust Square cut pizza is superior Thats pizza has half pepperoni half jalapeo Was he planning to split it with her or the nurse Great choice for your last meal well done sir I think thats my teacher It is delivery and not DiGiorno Its not DiGiornos its Marcos This is a strong message  No one will have Pizza Pepperoni You should go TellMarcos That pizza looks really good where did you get it I see legs I see pizza I

more confidence in yourself Yall be wasting food Madame Tussauds Wikipedia article is pretty crazy I recommend reading it TLDR she was shaved and scheduled to the guillotine for being a royal sympathizer during the French revolution She was spared and forced to make death masks of many of the famous people who were executed She went to England to show her art and couldnt return to France because of the Napoleonic Wars That lady had seen some shit I still like how the Trump audioanimatronic at Walt Disney World is just Hilary Clinton with spray tan and a different wig that is a mighty

other ultra liberal person crying over this political theater They even managed to capture some alternative hairstyle person placing the final pin in his coffin It is all too much and you all are trying too hard You are misrepresenting things to make things seem more representative If only thinking and wanting something really bad and complaining online created meaningful change then the new liberal creed might mean something Trump  See past the media he has been doing so much for our country but people dont want to believe iti care more about what a man does than what he saysand dont

everywhere  on signs shouted by protesters and used as a response to anyone trying to question womens right to choose It is accompanied by other vulgar slogans  Jeba PIS  Fuck PIS the ruling party  It shows how angry and fed up people really are and how this issue is important to them Its disgusting how this decision to fuck with the abortion law came in the middle of the pandemic given how previous attempts also sparked huge protests edit Forgot to add that the government officials started blaming people protesting for gigantic increase of the corona cases even thou we went from day to day before the protests even started Yea Im from Poland Ill tell YOu this folks I suspect the government did this either to cover the failures with fighting the pandemic or  there is something more behind it Polish people dont seem to be very happy about the idea of obligatory vaccination Government may want far left on the streets protesting and accuse them of spreading the covid I dont know really but there is something very fishy of why they put up this abortion subject right now I cant shake off the feeling that its a distraction from something bigger This is why you keep religion far far away from lawmaking Per herehttpswiadomosciradiozetplPolskaWarszawaStrajkkobietwWarszawieBrutalneatakinauczestnikowprotestuinterweniowalapolicja and Google Translate  BARTLOMIEJ CHUDY  October     photo Piotr Molecki  East News  A series of brutal attacks and attacks on the participants of Fridays Womens Strike in Warsaw So far the Warsaw police have detained a dozen or so people from among groups of hooligans attacking the protest It was not without the use of stun grenades Gas was used and its victim was to be among others Member of the Civic Coalition Bartomiej Sienkiewicz  The Womens Strike began on Friday in the capital at approx  Tens of thousands of people take part in the protest this is probably the biggest strike against the Constitutional Tribunals ruling on tightening the abortion law  There were clashes and attacks by football fans chanting national slogans Police intervention was necessary in the area of de Gaulle roundabout and Nowy wiat In a clash between two groups of young people objects were thrown physically attacked pyrotechnics were used the Warsaw Police Headquarters informed on Twitter  In turn around a hundred policemen at the National Museum clashed with a group of young men dressed in black  They were overpowered handcuffed and detained More police cars started to drive up to the pavement near the MN detainees were taken  reported the PAP reporter This is THE issue ppl should protest life is already hard why make this senseless laws Jeba PiS I think there is extremely few women to whom the choice of abortion is easy I am sure that most have been giving it a million thoughts before deciding to go through with it Making abortion illegal and making the already extremely difficult choice even more difficult is just unacceptable Here in Denmark it has been politically proposed that we should offer free abortions to the good people from Poland I am sad that is has come to this but I hope we end up doing something like that to help out those in need Jesus One step fwd two steps back But Im American so what can I really say Separation of church and state Fight for your rights Poland Stay safe if you can Your opinion on abortions does not give you the right to legally prevent people from doing what they want Fuck anyone who fights against the right to choose Na grze re na dole akacje   I KONFEDERACJE have a nice day americans Wow were going backwards Jeba PiS Hold on what I cant believe this is the first time Im hearing of this Fuck Religion Ruins Everything My parents are Polish immigrants living in the USA and the Polish nationalist TV station they watch has them convinced that the protests are some depraved leftist plot They dont realize Poland has changed since the s and are incredulous when my relatives in Poland try to tell them not to take PiS too seriously When you let religious beliefs create new laws you get this I feel so sorry for them I would be furious if abortion was banned where I live They are doing the right thing by protesting I dont think people should get abortions Thats my opinion But not everyone thinks like me Even if abortions are banned they will still happen Banning abortion only stops safe abortions Dont ban abortions it just hurts everyone Can we stop telling people what to do with THIER bodies already Usually on Reddit the comments are pretty left but the anti abortion sentiments are strong on this issue The religion is deep seeded I never knew Poland was so regressive Sad but depending on your history of people you can see this as murder or saving a life In my opinion the woman should be able to choose At which point do people overthrow the government like how bad does it have to get They didnt ban abortions they banned safe abortions Religion and law is not a good mix Lysistrata  the women of Poland should cut all of the men off until the law is reversed im a republican and tend to lean right on issues I never understood the idea of not allowing abortions especially abortions during early pregnancy from rape incest or if the child is a threat to the mothers life in some way Just when one thinks we are moving ahead as a species one need only be reminded that idiotic lawmakers are still trying to enforce morals with laws No uterus no opinion The government has no business telling women what they can and cant do with their bodies No definitely because Cyberpunk was delayed Yeah for sure Amidst a pandemic Stupid Trump wannabe government Duda is a Dupa The world is repeating the repressive totalitarian stunts from the s Thanks to the Catholic Church Poland is denying rights to LGBT folks because the fascists just feel like they are entitled to do so Fight for our rights now My full support to polish people I feel like in a pandemic you should not be passing laws that would result in large protests From a national saftey aspect All them going to get the covid What fucking year is this Quit letting religions run the state Godspeed noble friends Fight that good fight  If youre in an area where abortion is banned or restricted you arent out of options AidAccesshttpsaidaccessorg is run by physicians and womens rights advocates who offer abortion services internationally to women who may not otherwise have access This includes the USA where abortion is heavily restricted in some states and often very expensive

httpswwwwomenonwavesorg Or find your closest Planned Parenthood httpswwwplannedparenthoodorg Coming soon to an America near you Imagine getting raped and than have to keep the child Expect similar uproar in America if the Evangelicals attempt to do the same This here is why Republicans hate granting rights or benefits to Americans Once they get a taste of it it is impossible to take it away Pictures like this in the US are probably not far behind Were next Plus Poland now has LGBTQ free zones where gays are not welcome Can I ask a question as an ignorant American Is this some Putinesque attempt at destabilizing a democracy This is real reason why cyberpunk was delayed again Well did they vote those people into government in the first place The world is getting spicy Warszawo walcz I thought we here in America had the biggest idiots in politics turns out being dumb is a requirement to lead a country We need babes to invade   Wypierdala Two methods of birth control per lay keeps the abortion doctor away F Bloody Hell They look like theyre about to abort the polish government I mean our government rapes us since they were choosen not only nowdays PISdzirlce Another case of white elderly men deciding what Woman can do with their bodies The government should be afraid of its people Burn baby burn If you let the government deprive you of a right as this they will take more and more The ruling was made by a defunct puppet constitutional court but its a ruling of the court and not the government and as such cant be lawfully overturned It invalidates an abortion compromise that allowed aborting pregnancies threatening the life of the mother rape pregnancies and in cases of severe deformations of the fetus Almost all Poles agreed with this compromise including most of the supporters of the ruling party There were many protests before calling for more liberal abortion rights but they were never this big The majority of the protesters arent supporters of universal abortion rights but defenders of the compromise and people outraged at the audacity of the government Her body her choice when people will understand a womans body is not the property of anyone but hers This is what happens when people let religion into politics Poland is such a shit show Theyve gone for the gays and now its time to smash down the women What the fuck I thought Europe was supposed to protect its citizens Wonder if this will make the handmaid the frat house rapist and the head house slave on Americas Supreme Court think twice before doing something stupid Do they have a population crisis over there or something Why the fuck would they want this What a year To see just how truly horrible govts around the world are Covid be like Understandable have a nice day Stop STOP Youre making the blood droplet cry I think people should have the ability to do what they want to do but I just think Its kind of ridiculous that people hold abortion up to be this sacred act Man And where were at theyre protesting because the govnt wont stop killing ppl A view from Americas near future I hate to be the guy who makes it all about the US But fucking VOTE on Tuesday or were next And dont glamor vote for a rd party Vote for fucking Biden The United States Supreme Court best take note Too bad this kind of thing would NEVER happen in Korea Wow my home away from home seems to be on a parallel time line with the US Uhoh Could be the end of a political party when  of the populace opposes your policies Hopeful this will happen in the US if the dems dont do something to counter our latest Federalist monster But stuff is on fire Clearly theyre nothing more than a bunch of thugs who cant be taken seriously sarcasm from the USA You know religiously Im taught this is a sin but after almost being a teen dad at one point with my now ex I was greeted with the utter sense of doom The breakup was over other matters surprisingly How the hell am I supposed to raise another human being Thankfully the situation was a false alarm still though What would I be able to provide I would ruin both my childs and my partners lifes Not to mention my own So much independence would be relied on the grandparents I really dunno where Im going with this Basically I get where both sides come from and holy fuck they better reinstate that shit in Poland i hope they dont ban it in the US in the next two weeks cus then i guess im gonna have a kid And the US of A has a new catholic judge or Something Not sure if someone already posted it but just in case for any polish woman who needs abortion here is organization that can help httpsaborcjabezgranicpl And quick disclaimer because I saw many misleading posts on social media Dont belive that woman goes to jail for abortion According to law only doctor that performed it can be held responsible which obviously does not apply to German slovakian or Czech doctors My favourite one from yesterdays UK protest httpsiimgurcomHcgOVpng Get your pink hats ready Were going to need millions of them very soon How many people are for the ban Not saying that the government just didnt implement this randomly  I do not know but Im willing to bet more of the countries people support the ban Hence why the ban was enacted American here Watching Reversing Roe was incredibly enlightening and disturbing To see how Bush senior Bush Trump all made prochoice statements and quickly get pushed by religious andor conservative parties to change their minds after being voted into office Then subsequently trying to push evangelical agendas through senate and Supreme Court seats The battle for this is far from over on both sides but truly terrifying where we stand as a country today Idiots They are just making it harder now polish people have to go to a neighbouring country for an abortion Moron politicians Did the government change its mind or was the protest ignored like in Murica If only there was a correlation with popular sentiment and government policy Well why the fuck would they do that I want to protest out in the streets so bad but what about coronavirus How is the conservative class suddenly the biggest advocate for childrens rights I figured liberals with their increasingly tolerant and protective views would recognize that abortion is a matter of both the rights or the unborn child as well as the rights of the mother bearing it Since when did the left become so ruthless My fellow polish aint no simp politics on rpics always gets kinda gross I guess they should have aborted all these people so they wouldnt have this problem  Maybe there is still hope for Poland then What happened to all covid comments I thought big gatherings were bad People protesting because they legally kill there unborn children This is why society is fucked So theyre protesting not being able to kill a life Poland is weird so uh Covid doesnt exist now Wtf  Cyberpunk delay and now this My poor polish people  Now I know where CD project gets the inspiration for Cyberpunk This will have no impact on the pandemic because its outside Does a woman have the right to choose Absolutely Does the woman have the right to choose without the government trying to get involved Absolutely Do i have the right to judge my friend whos had  abortions in  years Absolutely Good for the government I hope the United States follows suit Thats because killing children is wrong Clickbait headline They didnt completely ban abortion they just tightened the law even more to a ridiculous extent Who gives them the right to decide over another persons body Never understood the POV of those people So hummm  about that no gathering thing  Did a majority of voters elect these lawmakers Did these lawmakers make it public that they were antiabortion Sounds like the majority have spoken Its good to see a country support the unborn More of this sold the world A wonderful change to stop killing children And I am glad they did it Dont hate but I think standard abortion is wrong because to me your killing a potential human being and if enough time passes a formed human being The only abortion I accept are rape abortions dead baby abortion or death of mother abortion To me abortion promotes sexual promiscuity which leads to increase in stdsand a toxic dating  relationship culture that we have today Which then leads to damaged familys and values Which then effect society How to me it promotes lack of consequences and responsibility for ones actions Abortions can also severely damage women emotionally psychologically and physically May leave women infertile To me a womens choice is made when they decide to indulge in sex Why only womens Because anything else would be rape If your not ready for kids use protection or dont have sex at all If you dont want kids get tubal ligation surgery or have your partner freeze sperm then get a vasectomy This way no kids till ready Now if you use protection but still get pregnant well be responsible for your actions I think I provided valid logical points here but Im willing to learn Maybe Im wrong Please dont flame just insult my views have points and try having a civil discussion Also Im not religious so no bias there Proud of Poland it should be banned Dont have sex if you dont want a baby Thats literally what its for Also contraceptives exist for this reason Animals in the wild dont kill their babies just cause they simply dont want them Stop normalizing fetus murder  hours  and a half days of being trapped alone under rubble as an innocent child I was trapped in an elevator for  minutes and started to get uncomfortable I cant even begin to imagine what this child went through Brings a tear to my eye Any word on her parents Edit RIP  poor kid xB  The Interior Ministry later said that Aydas mother was found dead by rescuers shortly after her childs rescuehttpsnewsskycomstoryturkeyandgreeceearthquakegirlrescuedinizmirafterhourstrappedunderrubble Now I have a kid of my own pictures like this absolutely break me Im in tears thinking about how scared she must have been No child should every go through anything like that what a strong little girl wow this is either a father or a man with alot of compassion either way a beautiful moment Im in tears imagining him telling her that everything will be ok This guy seems like such a sweetheart In the video footage he keeps his hand on her head while theyre putting an IV in the back of her hand and says things that I can only assume are comforting and encouraging  hours My kids cant go  minutes with out starving Poor kid So amazing they saved her Speechless amazing she survived Thats clearly a small child and not a baby though right This brought tears to my eyes I hope this little one goes on to do something amazing with her life That skintoskin contact likely kept her awake and from going into shock What a brave and beautiful thing to do  hours Can you imagine Heart breaking I wish that kid a speedy recovery No parent should go through this type of tragedy Before you kiss me can I have some water please I suddenly have an overwhelming urge to see my kids  show your kids some love people that picture will come back to haunt him come election time Is that legal in Turkey Legend Whos gonna say it Oh no Elon Musk gonna call him a pedo for sure People like Trump make me forget

better in time Poor girl I hope she finds solace in the years to come Fuckkkk that makes my heart hurt I have a four year old girl To think of her buried under tons of rubble destroys me Im so glad

mean this facetiously I just think itd be cool to know which part of the moon its on While I find astronomy fascinating I know nothing about it Nice The moon is made out of cheese Beautiful Moon mountains Your moon is pretty She wet how is this fucking possible What a picture I am mesmerized Just beautiful Can anybody explain why there scattered light around the moon since the moon doesnt have an atmosphere to scatter the light Thats beautiful How are the clouds behind the moon Wow what a really great photo Three Questions  How did you get the background glowlight  How did you get so many shades of browngrey that do not show up in most photos of the moon  You said it was  panels and  frames I am confused I went to photography school  years ago but I still dont quite understand Thanks for the photo You can really see the man on the moon Now I see what everyone was talking about httpsimgurcomTjtDY Youre in the southen hemisphere Stunning The detail  color I love it You chose well Holy Cheezus Way to perfect it I want my ceiling to be this color texture Awesome the amount of color you were able to capture Beautiful You can see the cheese rind and all Great shot Truly awesome Thats my favorite also deleted Wow thats incredible Well done Nice taken image Wow Fantastic pic Thats gorgeous Is this a iPhone or droid Thats awesome Will you be taking pictures tomorrow of the blue moon Asking for a friend  Nice picture Wow  Stupid question from a dad thinking about buying his daughter a telescope Can you look directly at the moon through one I mean because of the brightness of reflected sunlight I get theres a lot less of it coming from the moon than the sun but nights like tonight it seems brighter than Id want to look at for too long especially if magnified by a telescope Where was this picture shot from Northeast Hell of a shot Did you have an color filters on the lens wow this is incredible Stunning So you are the evil Gru No other way you could take such a close up shot of the moon Thats no moon its a space station Outstanding shot Have rarely seen it so clear and beautiful My favorite now too Nice work Amazing What kind of cheese is it I feel like I am choosing a patrol mission in Destiny That is sublime That is fantastic Great shot This is so damn cool I always assumed that people just had an adapter for their telescope and attached a camera and took pics I guess not LOL This is so beautiful crazy to think there is human made stuff out there Mine too For some reason this picture makes the moon look like its on the scale of a marble Whos that walking in the middle How did you get a depth of field effect with a subject so far away Mine too buddy This is breathtaking Great work Great shot Do you put higher res images anywhere Would love a new background Or do you sell them for prints I can see the water from here Absolutely beautiful Thank you for sharing Great photo The moon looks like it got beat up lol Is this near the sea of

pic Looks awesome What a coincidence its my favourite too fuckin sick Through a telescope Its the reaction of our ancient moon watching humans fuck up over many millennia My favourite moon I honestly feel like you could see people walking on the moon if they were there Luna lookin luscious Nice Breathtaking This is just amazing So is this zoomed in as much as your camera can or is this just intentionally framing the whole moon If people can get clear images of things much further than the moon why cant we get detailed images of the lunar surface Like spots in particular like the moon

Thorny and Seth Rogan had a baby More like Hamathorne Is Grandma Gomezs mother or Morticias mother I would just like to say a quick Hi to Pugsley Thanks Your Fester is on point I always upvote the Addams Family This Halloween is going to cost me a fortune in Internet points Well done you guys Gomez needs to be moresmiley This is the second time this year I saw a Morticia costume and thought Goddamn Gomez looking like Henry Cavill Pugsley has never been hotter  Model ass family Not bad Fester looks like a bald Michael Scott from The Office Hi Pugsley  Fester has the smirk down  Morticia is just wow Where is Thing I think we need a closeup of Pugsley to check for costume accuracy I think I saw the post youre anteing up on and while I commend the Pugsley over Pubert what I think they captured a bit better was the joy particular that the male Addamsseses had It was usually only Wednesday that a dower expression and Morticia was typically Swiss in her expression Beautiful family tho Wednesday looks pissed as is appropriate Pugslys too fine This is generally referred to as a call since you put in the same thing Pugsley got a time jump to the past Im seeing Mickey Rourke for some reason Is Pugsley single We need pinstripe suits to make a big comeback Pugsley is such a baby boyfriend Sorry Pugsly is NOT supposed to look that good but the rest is spot on Maybe a few clipped long stemmed roses wouldve put it over the top That guy actually smokes cigars haha good stuff No one ever seems to include Lurch Morticia has red lipstick Fester nailed it WHERES MUH BOY LURCH Wednesday was sick Good job  Pugsly kinda fine tho I like how like  of the comments are thirsty for Pugsley Lmao Morticia is making me feel dark and trembly Is it a competition Mehthen I like the other family Great Uncle Fester and Cara Mia Nice suit I see your addams family Pugsley   Clearly the Netflix adaptation exhibit A as in a hot angsty teen Pugsley I rest my case Pugsley looks a bit too buff tbh Netflix Adaptation Addams Family The other Family k likes and  awards This picture k live and  awards Objectively this picture is better buttttttt well ya know this is reddit  Morticia is smoking hot OP from the other Addams family here From one Gomez to another you guys killed it Great minds think alike right I liked the Adams family better I see your  and raise  mine is better which is stupid Not the right type of energy for any post but especially Halloween costumes That is a very  good  Morticia Pretty good I like it Morticia is absolutely beautiful I love her shoulders and arms too  Granny Gomez looking like the mom from Hereditary still no sign of john adams You win Awesome Wonder what shoes she wear Getting stoked for this Smashing Pumpkins reunion My favorite Addams family so

FUCKING PUBERT Daughter looks a LOT like the young actress in Hocus Pocus This is better than the animated movie This is my favorite Paul F Tompkins was in the Addams family This pic makes me want the cast of Schitts Creek to dress up as the Addams Family The first thing that came to my mind was SNAP SNAP The best thing about this family costume for the dad is you get to stand around acting aloof and smoking cigars all night That is my definition of an amazing night Phenomenal This Morticia should have an IG She is so pretty Wheres Lurch Where is the fucking hand Now where is that morticia dress from cause DAMN gimme At least your Gomez is holding the cigar normally Fairly certain Gomez has dog poo on his shoe Morticia  mega babe Youre missing one thing Pffff that Morticia is doing it pugsley could get it though  Ill assume hand is under the dress Why isnt the daughter wearing a costume She looks just like everyone else P Thats bad azz is no one talking about the girl in the middle who is she supposed to be Not enough pink on the set Whos the hottie in the middle behind the chair Wait Puggles and Wednesday age swapped Wheres that BABY Sigh You cant both see and raise Its one or

keeper Your wife looks smashing  at your daughters wedding Something aint adding up Damn shes still hot Nice work Your wife and the picture are lovely That dress on the other hand reminds me of a song from a play I was once in Well Ive walked down the aisle As much as Liz Taylor But Ive always stood off to the side Each bride has me dressed In a gown I detest Always a bridesmaid never a bride For Caitlin I wore satin Which I looked really fat in Then again you should have seen her man Ken All those calories he logged up Til his arteries clogged up He died on the couch watching ESPN Too many weddings too many dresses That all make my hips look so wide Not a gown Id reuse Ditto the matching shoes Always a bridesmaid Never a bride For Tabitha I wore taffetta You should never people laugh at

the jokeits still on my desk I love it My favorite ones httpsdumpsterfirecandlecomhttpsdumpsterfirecandlecom As an employee of the waste industry let me tell you a dirty trick the company charges customers for the total airspace of those bins x ft but in reality its very hard to fill them up over the lower part the side with the logo of the slant So when customers fill up the bin to the lower level they call for a pickup the remaining triangular space is basically pure profit that the customers paid for  It seemed to me like it lived its life like a candle in the bin Is it disappointment scented And its in a waste management container lol that company is shit to the billionth power if you have a choice never choose wm If the city has its own setup or you can get republic services you will be way better off Also if you have RS call in and ask about a lower price If youre not in a contracted area they will most likely drop price for you Iddy biddy dumpster fire I can even smell that scent  is basically a dumbster fire Fires not big enough Put it inside a train wreck to get the full effect I actually set fire to a dumpster by mistake Was waitressing in a cafe Tipped contents of ashtray into cafe bin Later tipped bin into dumpster in a separate room Short time later noticed smoke coming from dumpster room Not a lot though and fortunately only smoldering Was a lot more careful

for us in Upstate NY httpspollspizzahttpspollspizza time I voted in Mississippi today with no line Im hoping that the lines just mean we have a record number of people voting Absentee voting in the state is x the  level Go vote yall This makes me so angry deleted It justit just looks so third world In germany we always vote on sundays which is a nonworking day for most people and there is one polling place per  people These lines are democracy NOT working This is why states should go to automatic mail voting like in Washington I was able to vote in the comfort of my own home Im voting in MS too My coworker warned me about the lines so I got out there at the ass crack of dawn so I wouldnt be late for work I feel your pain but at least the weather looks agreeable Another reason election day should be a national holiday Deliberate to suppress and discourage voting Thats the deep south way Hang in there Its our duty to rescue democracy You are literally doing heroes work today I guess youre not allowed to bring a camping chair Because nobody seems to use one How are those signs allowed to be there As an American this is embarrassing Glad youre out there voting but this is archaic Im confused no early voting How does this work Are all employers forced to shut for the day What if you cant get time off to vote Wouldnt this effectively lock a bunch of people out of voting It took me two and a half hours to vote in MS this morning Update it took my husband and mother both  hours to vote later in the day and yet people still wonder why so few eligible americans vote its this shit right here editthank you all for your commitment to american democracy I voted in Mississippi this am and it took me a whopping  minutes How come every time I see a picture from Mississippi I shake my head no matter what its about Holy shit I was just there Waited about an hour and a half Half of the people there are not wearing any masks Heres a comment to read while you wait Dig the commitment Sorry that your state has dumb voting policies Im in Texas and when I went to vote there was  other person there Either voter suppression worked that well or I was lucky lmao Demand better of your state in the future Washington state here and I voted at my kitchen table with a beer and my laptop for researching candidates and referendums That sucks Tell your state to flatten the curve I voted a couple weeks ago  mins parking to driving away Voter supersession voting should be easier Long line for sure but it does look like people are trying to maintain a six foot separation although its hard to tell on the section of line where everyones back is turned to the camera Maybe its not as bad as it looks Whenever I see stuff like this I am extra grateful that we have mailin voting Geez Sorry I was done in less than an hour up here in the state that the Mississippi River starts I voted from my room while smoking cannabis Vote by mail needs to be a thing everywhere I tried to vote at am this morning when the polls opened in Missouri There was absolutely no way I was voting and getting to work by am The parking lot was overflowing and just pulling in got me stuck in  minutes of gridlock Heres to hoping I dont have to wait for hours on end after work Holy shit Stay strong and steadfast out there Mississippi has the largest Black American population percentage of any other state  Yet only ONE of the House reps and none of the senators are African American The state government is Republican controlled at every level Which is to say that theres no fucking way that happens without massive voter suppression We need a congressional hearing and to haul their asses before Congress to see them squirm trying to justify that reality Also flood the state with voter registration volunteers along with the FBI to watch over them and do some digging in their county clerks offices What a clusterfuck You get who you vote for Americans are just realizing they voted in the people that are fucking them Its like waiting in line at Disneybut with real consequences Good on you and everyone there to vote and wait out these ridiculous lines Election reform Depends where in MS of course I was in and out in  minutes in Meridian I was in line for  minutes today in Massachusetts where we have both early voting and mail in voting It was nice to see Thank you for voting My cousin in Biloxi waited  hours Thats ridiculous voter suppression at its finest Vote for Dems so you can get some voter rights Dont most places have laws against campaign signs and such near a polling place Or is the line just that long Its weird to me as a Canadian that your rules vary state by state for the same FEDERAL election ahhh shit someones doing the reddit thing better hide my face from those animals Unfortunately Im in Mississippi and it took  and a half hours I didnt bring a chair or water My back is trying to implode MS is the last state in virtually everything This does not surprise me at all Mississippi Goddamn  Nina Simone Come on Mississippi Most states are better than this Come on Lived in MS and studied a course on voter suppression in the state Its insane They will have  poll location in a predominantly black area and will adjust the hours of operation to make it nearly impossible for someone whos working to vote Sad state in a lot of ways Mississippi making Kentucky look prosperous since  No offence USA but the way you do elections is just so fucking stupid Jesus fucking Christ You guys are really bad at democracy Ive literally never had to queue to vote Scotland They guy in the chair not even facing the direction of the line lol solidarity dude Never forget only one party systematically fights tooth and nail to keep people from being able to vote Stay strong Vote Biden and Mike Espy You can do this I am in Mississippi and I was in and out in  minutes Absentee voting was also an option in Mississippi It isnt as bad as people are making it out to be There are just more people out voting this time Is it not illegal to have campaign signs near polling stations Its sickening that these red states have made voting such a complicated time consuming process Theres literally no reason why anyone should have to wait an hour or longer just to vote This is by design Voters in blue states dont have to jump through fiery hoops and wait on absurdly long lines to vote I know its still a ways off but remember and remind your friends family colleagues that anyone in line when the polls close is allowed to vote They should stay in line and not let anyone convince them otherwise Stay with it This is definitely a problem but Im really curious why more people dont vote by mail as a default Depending on your states rules you might have to make up your mind a few day earlier assuming the mailed ballot has to be received by election day but isnt that way easier than risking having to wait in line for  hours Again voting dayof in person should be easier but given that its not can someone explain to me why more people dont leverage absentee voting Thanks for voting Nice weather favors the Dems Why are there partisan voting signs at the polling location Isnt that a felony No matter how much its disguised bourgeois democracy always ends up looking like the farce it is I though it was against the rules to have voter propaganda at the polling site Signs for both but still not right Voter suppression at its finest Oh just look at the freedom Id laugh if it werent so horrible This is should be ilegal Vote anyone out of office who doesnt want to make it easier for you to vote Why didnt they allow early voting Hold them accountable Every state should have the same rules This is ridiculous I wouldnt vote for a Republicant ever again after that long wait I dont forget bs This is why theyre last in education How the fuck are they allowing TrumpPence signs right outside of the polling station isnt that against the rules What the fuck America You make voting look really really really difficult Fix your democracy Ridiculous I was able to vote weeks ago What the fuck NO early voting They allowed to place those signs in the line Ga is Fed up but that crap wont fly As a Canadian this is completely mind blowing to Me Ive lived in both our biggest cities as well as small rural towns and voting has never taken me more then  minutes once I show up Trumps bread lines Move to Colorado Mail in ballot early voting Also if you are like me and waiting last second I filled out the ballet they mailed me and just drove up and handed it to me Took maybe  minutes to drive there and  seconds to hand it to them and say thank you This is insane I voted from the comfort of my home we have mailin ballots AND early votingwhy is this not a national mandate So thats how some of these states prevent poor people working  jobs from voting Thanks for sticking it out and voting OP Got downvoted for saying we are democracy in name only I wonder what those deniers tell themselves when they see these photos These people are absolute heroes I wish I could personally thank all of them Im sorry This is ridiculous This is my first time voting My ballot DID NOT come in the mail So I went to an early voting site after work on Monday I was in and out as fast as I could vote So why are these people made to wait such horrible times I cant imagine I live in a small town Took me less than  minutes this afternoon So you guys making a prequel to Idiocracy No Just a reality tv show Ok then s Im surprised they allow those election signs so close to the voting poll Dont fuck it up Mississippi Bro I felt that but Im in a different part of Mississippi Why would you ever live in Mississippi The pot roast cant be that good You can listen to bluegrass on YouTube from anywhere on earth Just move Long lines by design due to the sociopaths in charge who think only the idle rich should have a say Its crazy to think all this effort to vote but you dont actually vote for the President you vote for a elector who may or may not vote for the person they were elected to vote for And this is somehow called Democracy Last elections  republican elector voted Democrate and  Democrate voted Republican essentially nullifying the vote of the people in their state who voted Where is the democracy in that Smells a lot like a Plutocracy where the rich decide the Candidates and then can change who actually wins remember how Bernie Sanders should have stood against Trump but the party wanted Clinton as she wouldnt rock the wealth boat of the party benefactors Live on the coast and am confirm Two and a half our wait I voted early in Mississippi They do require you to give them an excuse like you travel for work or have a health condition but it is possible to vote early in the state Im also from MS I passed by two polling places on my way to work today One of them where I voted had next to no wait time The other had lines similar to this and hours long wait times There were only about  miles apart Are you serious No early voting in MS I dont even have words to express how enraged and disappointed that makes me feel Im so sorry Youre fighting the good fightstay strong deleted Please vote Biden The Deep South is a third world country and we need to recognize it as such Sorry Fuck Republicans Fuck Trump Fuck all of you nut jobs who think that voting should be limited to wealthy white people Fuck you wackos who want to suppress votes Unfuckingbelievable Its easier to vote for your favorite American Idol contestant than it is for the leader of the god damn free world Its great that record numbers are finally showing up to vote but the next comign administrations better start addressing this complete embarrassment and failure of a voting system we have Its fucking pathetic Not surprised Mississippi is notorious for voter suppression Let me guess  that district historically leans democrat right Attempted disenfranchising in action This is what it looks like when your leaders are trying to discourage you from voting Voter Suppression  This is what happens when uneducated people keep electing politicians who do not have the public interest in mind Education cuts social programs disappearing and the people too ignorant to realize that the people they keep voting for are responsible for the degradation of their quality of life Keeping voting Rs in positions of power and the lines will only get longer food and voting poverty levels will rise and women and minorities will continue to be disenfranchised It is so painfully obvious that the people in power in Mississippi do not want civic participation What a trash state Is there anything Mississippi does right Actual question Voter suppression Fuck Republicans Thats crazy why arent more places opened to vote so u dont have to wait so long Elections in Spain are pretty fucked up too but at least they let us properly vote Good luck fellow americans i really hope today turns out okay Good luck and thank you And they had so much time to fix this Hang in there Fill up your stomach while you wait and its free httpspollspizzahttpspollspizza Dont let them rob you of your voice those ridiculous lines are there on purpose Voting is the most patriotic thing you can do I really feel for everyone who doesnt have the option for early voting AZ does a lot of stupidmessed up stuff but one thing weve done right ever since I was old enough was early voting by mail I live in WA which is a mail in only state You have to sign the outside envelope which is scanned to see if it matches your registration signature on file if the scanner doesnt like it its kicked out for a human check You have the option of putting your email or phone number on the envelope so you can be contacted if there is a problem I went online about five days after I mailed it and it was recorded as being accepted Took me about  minutes to fill out the ballot and I didnt even have to put a stamp on it or you can drop it off if youre worried about the mail I think most people would prefer a few minutes sitting at a table over a few hours standing in line In Evanston IL I walked straight in during lunch zero wait for machine Took me min to get there vote and get home Oof thanks for doing your civic duty I feel for you I literally walked right up to the counter handed over my voter ID and was given a ballot There was no line Small Town USA for the win This is what voter suppression looks like Not enough polls for all eligible voters Cripes Doesnt Mississippi ever get tired of being well Mississippi Voted this AM in VA Took total of  minutes No crowd at that time of the morning Glad to do my part MS Fighting to be the last in everything for more than  years Ive been a Utah voter my entire adult life and I honestly didnt know that all states didnt automatically send out ballots to all registered voters before this year So bizarre Thanks for sticking with it What are the rules on having political signs near a voting center Is there a certain distance That one lady had a chair Nice My first thought was that campaign signs arent usually allowed near the polling place My second thought was wow theyre that far out I woke up to find out that my neighborhood is a registered place to vote I couldnt leave my home for work without feeling i was going to run someone over I find it hilarious that we can do everything online in MS but not vote online Mississippi is insane I hope every good person in that state finds a way to leave it as soon as possible STAY VIGILANT What shithole country does this Man I really take mail in voting for granted Filled out my ballot at home and walked  minutes to the mayors office to drop it off Man voting in the US seems so old I dont think Ive ever seen a queue voting here in the UK So glad we have mail in voting in Oregon th election and never had to wait in a line Props to all of you stickin it out to get your voice heard Crazy I voted from the comfort of my home weeks ago Everyone should be able to vote absentee if u want to The voting system in the US never stops to surprise me From the outside it looks to be constructed to keep people away from voting or at least the people you dont want in the voting booths Its stupid how a semi developed nation can have such a poor system even if its not on a national level dont get me started on the electoral system Ridiculous In Massachusetts theyve had early voting  weeks before the election didnt even have a line Why is it so hard to vote down south Voter suppression help a particular party Why is voting not standardized by the feds So dumb Take mins tops in Canada to vote and thats at a really busy polling station Make the US look like an backwards country Keep it up Mississippi This is basically a poll tax People have to take off work to wait in absurd lines because the statecounty doesnt have their shit together Jesus it wasnt bad where I voted but I know that every place is different hope everyone is able to vote on time That is a disgrace and if this administration was capable of it they would be ashamed Democracy lol Voter suppression Hmm Might need to elect a new state government Smalltown Michigan We had early voting and a dropbox outside Took  minutes at pm There was no wait in here in New Mexico This needs to be fixed In general I refuse to wait in lines but this vote was worth it to me We waited for an hour but the long line moved quickly and it was nice to meet some very friendly locals Were not originally from this area and its always great to meet some of the older folks who grew up here Good masking nice weather great turnout I just got off work Hoping the line isnt too long now  Fuck you Mississippi Florida has  days of early voting Get your shit together I live in MS and I voted early Proud of you for sticking it out thank you Why no early voting  That sucks  but please vote Maybe vote the shitbirds out that are making it hard for you all to vote Washington State checking in They mailed us our ballots  weeks ago I filled it out immediately and took it to a drop box I was able to go to check my ballot status at httpsvotervotewagovhttpsvotervotewagov  It showed as Accepted when I checked  days later Edit Almost forgot There was no line since drop locations are everywhere and weve got  weeks and not  freaking day Also we could just mail them but since agent orange is dismantling the USPS I decided it best to hand deliver States that make it hard to vote like this should not be receiving substantially more in federal taxes than they pay Mississippi gets like  back for every  they pay The more I learn about the US voting system the happier I am to be European Believe me that when I explain some of the voting tactics some states employ people here struggle to believe it Like Why is mail vote not allowed in some states How is something like gerrymandering even a thing That said best of luck to all yanks Heres hoping you make the right choice orange out in case youre wondering I live in a small town not even k people took about mins to vote today  Disgraceful My whole family voted early last week No early voting in that county My mom lives in Ms and she voted last week Thats a failure of government if I ever saw one I was in and out in  minutes West Michigan here took me  min this morning at am EST Wierd that you can have election signs so close to a poll Hang in there Thank you for voting What happens if people get there just before closing forcing the poll to be open most of the night Doesnt voting have to be done by the end of the day Isnt it illegal to have political candidate signs or propaganda near polling stations Or is the line that long I showed up  minutes before the polls opened in MS We ended up in line  blocks from the entrance Took us  and a half hours to reach the front of the line And that was just for the people who came early Why would the people of Mississippi put up with that Texas feels your pain where I am Church behind me had the line weaving up and down all the parking isles Good old American voter suppression Those people inspire me Looks like the DMV when I went a month ago Line wrapped around the block and was told it would be  hours from the end of the line to when I got service Its Mississippi you know the land that time forgot Only state in the US that I felt like I was in a third world shithole And were supposedly the greatest nation on earth What a disgrace Good on them for sticking through that Hopefully with people like Trump out of office our leaders can work towards fixing that problem for future voters For the states that dont have access to mail in voting or early voting it should be a work holiday to get off and vote if you do want to get in there and vote Its a law where you cant be turned away even after they close right Damn I did early voting here in tn and it still took almost  hrs I cant imagine how long its be without it So why do people not vote early Is it for the full general election experience Why would you want early voting Its like you think democracy is good or something silly like that Loving everything i see in your country haha From the north I want early voting to become a national policy Zero reason standing in line to vote should take more than  minutes even during a pandemic Canadians like to boast how it takes them  minutes no matter what America democracys biggest joke Keeping America great Please explain to me how this is what democracy looks like but me here in Oregon taking  mins to vote and put my ballot in a secure dropoff box isnt Wowshame no matter who u are voting for Op Does this have anything to do with hurricane Zeta Sorry from another country why does it take so long I voted early in Mississippi Just went to the court house and told them I would be out of the county on Election Day Filled out my ballot signed it and handed back in That was over a month ago We went midmorning and it was a  minute wait Things were set up well wasnt a problem for us However I know someone who went first thing this morning and had a twohour wait I voted at  today usually I am in the thousands by the time I vote Walked right in and voted not even there for a minute I was in the low s Dont know if most people voted early or just didnt vote This is disgraceful No early votingamid pandemicLeadership needs to be changed out Thank you for your sacrifice Wtf Waves from Oregon stay the course people Rly you have to get this under control asap I dont know any other developed country that has lines like this Its an affront to a democracy Thats the reality of a large voter turnout The elections have always prepared for half of a third of the populace to vote Mail in ballots Especially during covid Are there no rules against electioneering within a certain distance to the polls Early voting line in Upstate NY for me was about as long as OP  hr wait last week It moved faster than I thought it was going to when we got there This is not democracy lol
