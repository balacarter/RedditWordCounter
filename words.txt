Does democracy and public outcry mean nothing anymore  of unique comments made to the FCC were in support of Net neutrality and  million total comments were sent We the people spoke and we the people were ignored Not once did the FCC even offer to have a public hearing to discuss Net Neutrality but rather they shut their doors and laughed at our comments They outright mocked us in an attempt to make our opinions less important and to make our outcry seem like the work of trolls There is still more we can do We need Congress to step up and to create their own laws protecting Net Neutrality so make your voiced heard Reddit and fuck the FCC The fact that Ajit Pai made a video mocking us shows how little they care We havent made enough of an impact so we need to keep going Just because the FCC has gone against the wishes of the country it is supposed to be serving this does not mean we should stop fighting for net neutrality Dont let this be a defeat let this be further motivation to make your voice heard even more and to keep going in your efforts until we get net neutrality established as a law This dude talking just said hopefully Congress makes a set of rules preventing payed priority for businesses THEN WHATS THE FUCKING POINT OF REPEALING IT DIPSHIT Mignon Clyburn is my hero today Her speech was so powerful She listened to us its too bad no one is listening to her ETA Im so proud that this is my most upvoted comment Thanks everyone  The fact that the FCC is choosing to do this really saddens me Thank you for fighting so hard for net neutrality Reddit Make sure you guys remember that while some congressmen sent a letter of support for net neutrality more than  members of the House sent a letter supporting Ajit Pai Do not under any circumstances let them forget that they ignored the will of the people and support their opponents in the  elections  even if that means you have to vote for someone from a party you hate because your district has no one from the party you prefer Heres the letter supporting Ajit Pai See if your rep signed it httpsenergycommercehousegovwpcontentuploadsFCCNetNeutralitypdf Link with  of the  names in print the rest are still

our elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC And its different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to

criticize the FCC vote we have a real chance to making this happen But it wont be easy and it can only happen within  legislative days of the order going into effect We cant stop now Contact your reps today and demand that they preserve net neutrality through Congressional Review Acthttpswwwbattleforthenetcom Youll see a script on your screen or you can say something like this I support Title II net neutrality and I urge you to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a resolution of disapproval reversing the FCCs December vote to repeal the Open Internet Order You can also text BATTLE to  to use a simple chatbot to send a message to your lawmakers We can still win this Even if youve already contacted your reps now is the time to call them again We need all hands on deck Please take a moment and make the call then spread the word sticky this post or help drive traffic to httpswwwbattleforthenetcom I posted this elsewhere but I feel like copying it here The death of Net Neutrality will not affect you overnight like most places are reporting You wont pay  for Facebook  for streaming sites etc or things like that You wont have access to certain sites blocked Rather it will happen slowly and secretly over the next few years which is arguably worse Youll notice Netflix and Twitch will start buffering more and more while your ISP sends you a mailer to buy their cablemovie package Your VoIP will drop calls while your ISP promotes a competitor at a special price Independent online games will struggle to have reliable pings while AAA games seem to have no problem How do we know this will happen Because ISPs have already tried this in the past when the legality was unclear Now that its fully legal what will stop them In the meantime youll forget When they dont charge  for access to Netflix youll think to yourself that the whole NetNeutrality cause was overblown You wont notice the gradual decline of your ISP and youll forget what you once expected of them The ISPs will win unless we continue to fight but I find it hard to believe that we can maintain this anger for so much longer ISPs have done this before And repealing Net Neutrality only enables them more The vote is going to be disappointing but we know this isnt the end This will immediately get into a court battle and I think it looks favorable to us Pai has been so flagerant on ignoring the people thatll be a factor That and more importantly he has outright ignored several Attorney Generals on the matter of the fake comments on his own site I have to imagine that is going to play a MAJOR rule in court Also one of the dissenters in Michael OReilly bluntly stated they were never going to consider those comments anyways whether they were bots or not Might be a big factor in the courts as well We gotta keep pestering our reps Weve seen that a few GOP members have flip flopped in favor of NN The more we keep expressing our disgust in this the more likely they could pass something in Congress Weve done it before with the healthcare repeal and we can do it here I just dont want people to give up or have a defeatist attitude on this Yes it does suck the vote will go the way we dont want it But the fact of the matter is that it isnt over Not by a long shot Seeing the video Ajit Pai made basically mocking Internet users made me incredibly mad Its clear he thinks that those of us who were fighting against him are basically mindless idiots who only use the most basic things the Internet offers People like him are whats wrong with this world So much greed and ego Looking down on the Little guys He fails to mention that well still be able to do all these things relatively free of charge We all know that the things that were so simple to do at one point are suddenly going to become more difficult as companies put things behind pay walls I hope this doesnt last very long that somehow some way it gets overturned I just know the second companies see that extra  rolling in from us a lot more are going to follow and it will become the new norm KEEP PUSHING THIS ISSUE Courts can help Actual laws enacted by congress can help The FCC isnt all powerful Keep fighting There is an immediate plan to overturn the FCC vote The organizations behind BattleForTheNetcomhttpswwwbattleforthenetcom are calling on Congress to use a Resolution of Disapproval under the Congressional Review act to nullify their decision It only takes a simple majority in the House and Senate We can do it Call your reps nowhttpswwwbattleforthenetcom I love how the one guy said they didnt care about the comments but then said if you wanted to express your opinion to write a comment Dont get discouraged The flood of protests received by the FCC and our representatives act as a record of where we as a people stand People that in spite of his eggregious actions Pai claims to represent Even though they are blatantly false his justifications for this action are worded as though it is on our behalf Now we have an overwhelming record that this is not what we want and it is not in our best interest And hes going to do it anyway This is important It may be the key to undoing this and holding Pai responsible In the realm of law and government it is near impossible to objectively prove a policy good or bad Its far easier to show a failure to follow proper procedure or contradiction of ones duty and own stated intentions These latter faults are where weve irrefutably shown Pai has crossed the line Theres already signs that this may be the area of focus in fighting back in conjuction with the FCC not addressing its previous flood of fraudulent comments Note the language in the official objections below about the legitimacy of the process the scope of the FCCs reach and the dubious motives of those involved  httpslieuhousegovmediacenterpressreleasesreplieuopposesfccnetneutralityvotetomorrow  httpswwwcommercesenategovpubliccachefilesdabfeaaadbdaeDDBCBBEDBAACFDbndemlettertofccrenetneutralitypdf  httpswwwwiredcomstoryfccmustinvestigatefraudbeforevotingonnetneutrality  httpstwittercomSenWarrenstatus Take heart in these public servants that stand with us along with  US AGs and many more They are fighting the good fight to win the war not the battle It can feel like were screaming into the void But we have given those that can fight this a great tool a public record demonstrating that Pai and the FCC are acting against our interests against their oaths and against their own words EDIT fixed broken link to Senator Warrens post  speech Thanks upreppypoof for pointing it out uspez uarabscarab uknthing If a Comcast or Verizon or whoever approaches reddit and says theyre basically putting together a Social Media Elite Pro MegaAccess package that gives you a different level of access nonthrottled or maybe even priority traffic to your website are you willing to sign that deal The users are going to get the short end of this stick but the long end still reaches out to the sites that are cordoned off by unneutral net The three FCC votes to repeal are disgusting Just no shame to their bribe taking The current guy talking and trying to justify the repeal is just filled with contradictions and lies Damn its sickening to know this level of corruption can happen openly in  Edit  The major argument for repealing seems to be lets go back to bipartisan and how the Internet flourished before  Things were fiiiiine then and Im sure the telecoms wont try to screw people in the future if we go back to the way it was Its complete crock The law was a reaction to recognizing a vulnerability in the system which could screw the consumers It was the government protecting the rights of the people against corporations Difficult to imagine I know Edit   Listening to Pai now Infuriating The second big argument is roughly similar to trickle down economics Companies cant be competitive if we regulate them They wont be able to make any money and invest If we just let them be Im sure they will pay workers well and create lots of jobs They wont abuse their power to throttle like they have in the past  Yeah Sure Edit   The  ayes take it Pai congratulates everyone for their eeeexcellent work Edit   Mignon Clyburn was super She had some really great points and it seems like the issue wont end today Nice to see all the links in this thread on ways for people to voice their opinions Lol the potato guy pretty much just said thnx get the camera away hehe dont zoom in on my fat wallet please This is absolutely mindboggling to me The malicious lies the no shame bullshitting on how the repeal is not going to matter or even it is going to make it even better and freer  this is just insane to me Its like the government would just one day decide hey you know how we put people who kill others in prison yeah thats because of old laws and its not needed anyway in fact people are going to murder less when we take away this archaic and needless restriction And the way they spin it The way they say it  that they are for internet freedom Fucking sickens me Disgusting corrupted spineless people Well they did it despite the fact a majority of voters in either party oppose it Something akin to  of the population opposes it on the whole They didnt care They wont start caring Petitions were faked identities stolen to do so New York found over  million identities to have been stolen to fake antiNet Neutrality comments but they didnt halt the vote The FCC refused to cooperate in New Yorks investigation No amount of petitions phone calls emails letters etc got through to the GOP Its not going to start working now The only things you can do now are vote the people who let this happen out of office and take the ISPs to the courts when applicable It is worth noting This has been a partisan issue with the GOP siding against net neutralityhttpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsjsbgmthefccmeetingfornetneutralityhasbegundrtpfc Mark this and vote accordingly The GOP is in the majority in the FCC and the FCC Commissioners votes were down party lines Remember their disregard of the public trust in  remember it in  It can be undone  the Telecom companies will try their best to profiteer in the interim knowing full well that their time is limited Take them to task legally whenever they overstep their bounds and hold free speech hostage for more money Remember this breach of Democracy this betrayal of the over  of Americans who did not want this VOTE THEM OUT Commissioner Clyburn gave an amazing heartfelt eulogy in favor of Net Neutrality  at which Ajit replied So thats a no and everyone laughed What a heartless corporate shill Ajit said Let consumers decide who prevails but most consumers only have  option Of course they are going to choose the only internet they can get And the consumers did decide They sent millions of comments online telling the FCC No but Adjit and his cronies just ignored all of us When was the last time  of the American people agreed on anything I dont even think  of population would agree that oxygen is important So as a giant middle finger to those  they plowed through any sort of protest or phone call or letter or email just to shove this up our collective butts Politicians and bureaucrats are the worst people in the world and if we let them fuck everything up then by god they will fuck everything up If you can and are willing consider visiting your House Reps office An inperson visit and conversation will leave a deeper impression on the legislators staff The offices are open to the general public and anybody can come in during their work hours no appointment needed Youre not likely to get to speak to the legislator themself but their staffers especially if you ask for and get their legislative director help shape a legislators world view and actions and our goal is to let them know their constituents care deeply about net neutrality Youll find that the people at the office will be very nice to you and not at all antagonistic after all they want your support You may also find that your Rep has an office conveniently near you or your commute Some additional tips When talking to a congressional office there are  key pieces of info you want to make sure you get across the ones with decent staff will ask you for the info but some of them slack Your nameyour address so they know youre an individual in their district the issue you care about and which side of it youre on In addition to talking to the staffers every congressional office Ive been to and Ive been to lots will have a form you can fill out where you can write down your concerns Be sure to ask for the form and write down your support for net neutrality Congressional offices are almost always open  weekdays The truism the squeaky wheel gets the grease applies Our goal here is to squeak loudly for net neutrality and if possible squeak in person  of Americans vote for no Decision is yes DEMOCRACY FREEDOM On the advice of security were going to take a brief recess httpswwwfccgovgenerallive Ok that sounds like someone either broke into the building bomb threat etc Right in the middle of Pais remarks MAN this is getting THRILLING Knowing how shady the FCC has been recently I wouldnt be surprised if this was Ajits idea to delay the vote while trying to save face and still blame NN protesters as being at faultbeing violenttheyre evil since they tried to stop the vote so that means were doing a good thing We cant let terror win Ajit Pais face is too perfect to not be featured in Southpark listening to their speeches was horrifying  seeing regulatory capture in action is an affront to every american regardless of political affiliation In the back of my mind I wish that we could throttle and fuck over all websites or things associated with supporters of this repeal Final edit FCC repealed the net neutrality rules Get involved here httpswwwbattleforthenetcom Uh they didnt vote yet  Live stream httpsmyoutubecomwatchvdlLU Edit  nay  yay so far  PM EST Edit this second dude is definitely a yay  PM Edit yeah he voted yay  PM EST Edit  this second lady sounds like a nay  PM EST Edit she just brought up the Russian prorepeal comments  sick

now Probably going to finish the vote now Edit  PM Pai forgot he was talking about killing internet freedom but picked back up pretty quickly Edit  PM still shilling Edit  PM They voted  for repeal Ya know maybe im just being emotional since im VERY frustrated by all of this but letters calls and voting simply arent working These people dont give a single fuck about any of us They literally do not care if you are even alive or dead We are a product to them to be bought and sold and its disgusting Im sick of it This isnt a call to violence but the only way things will change is if these people in government are afraid Making them uncomfortable and fearful is at this point the only thing that will reverse the course this country is on These fucks need to be reminded that their job is to represent us Its not an opportunity to add more zeros to their bank account its an opportunity to help the community that elected them This needs to be dramatically pointed out to them and if the current course continues there needs to be consequences Were rapidly approaching the point of no return if were not past it already  It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this public concern not to mention the objections expressed by his fellow commissioners the FCCs own CTO more than a hundred members of Congress dozens of senators and the very builders of the modern internet This is what astounds me At this point Im literally yet to hear from anyone who wont profit from a lack of net neutrality that is in support of it This is so clearly a decision influenced by money and backhanders that I fail to see how a modern society can allow something like this to happen I hope and genuinely believe that this will not be allowed to happen when it finally comes down to it but I still wish and pray for the best Regards an avid internet user from across the pond  You cant claim you didnt ignore the comments when you insulted the people who made them and then in the same sentence say the comments had no affect on your decision Fucking hell It is time for GoogleAppleNetflix and any other Internet company worried about NetNeutrality to work with local towns to develop and build a network that will be open freefrom regulations and accessible to all There is enough technical talent in most areas that if these companies partnered with town and municipalities they could put Comcast and Verizon out of business in under  years It is time it would be a boon to small infrastructure businesses and put the big boys on notice Time to take those billions and make a difference To learn about Net Neutrality why its important andor want tools to help you fight for Net Neutrality visit

as negative I just dont get it Those two women were todays heros As time goes on it becomes more and more apparent that the public have next to no say in what happens in the world Oh great the internet is going to be a convoluted clusterfuck like trying to get cable channels on my TV Ignorant corporate shills Fuck all of em How can they talk about how Net Neutrality damaged our internet services since it was enacted and restrict future growth I am living in the same house since I was born and always have had a kbs connection with no improvement or new lines put in or anything My only two options are ATTs DSL or Uverse or Verizons FIOS DSL service All of which are complete and utter shit and have problems daily with Even the fucking ATT technician said not to get Uverse because we would have more troubles with that than the land line Your own fucking technician said that So please Commissioners tell me how this is going to improve my life The fucking balls you all have to say Net Neutrality is bad I literally have a second or third world internet connection with no long term improvement in sight This is why I have considered moving to other countries or states Edit I reread this post after calming down from watching the FFCs vote and looking at the comments And I see how this can be confusing to read For me Net Neutrality really didnt solve anything regarding my internet or speed of service but I still want the protections it has to offer among hoping it helps all of you other redditors out with your service We shouldnt have to fight for what Net Neutrality stands for in this day and country  nays  yays Ajit Pai is left and we all know what hes going to say This is it o So this is how democracy dies They heard us  they heard everyone They heard that the

look back on today as the day the Internet died Millions of texts calls and emails from citizens cant do shit against millions of dollars from a few companies This is not democracy Its fucking

absolutely mad This dude can rot The internet worked just fine with the old rules  minutes later The internet isnt like other utilities It changes very quickly OH YOU DONT FUCKING SAY On the advice of

unbelievably disgusting Mentions of baseless fearmongering false arguments and baseless imagination What a fucking joke Uh oh security threat One of the many symptoms of the death of democracy and birth of olgigarcy The will of the people is waved aside as populist and alarmists This is a pattern that can seen in the lead up to oligarchy and autocracies through modern history I feel the only way we are going to be heard is to make a severe dent in Verizon ATT Comcast et als bottom line They might not hear our voices but they will hear our dollars or lack thereof This is fucking ridiculous In the wake of average people and congress calling for a delay of vote due to some frankly horrible accusations fraud and identity theft they push ahead anyways They are obviously bought and paid for corporate shills they sold us out America congress needs to take net neutrality and pass laws that only congress can get rid of immediately Pai keeps talking about virtual reality bandwidth as though VR uses the internet to send its signals Just putting it out here how clueless he is about how the internet workshow desperate he is for supporting arguments Edit Bandwidth for Dual K VR LMFAO hes is definitely both Hes manipulative and an idiot Edit  Yes I know hes actually not an idiot and that hes manipulating people Its just funnier to pretend hes part idiot Under a flag of net neutrality I made a point to always pay for the services and content I used to support a free and open internet that was geared towards the consumer And now Yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me Edit To the people saying pirating wont work now the effects wont be immediate and there are ways around it Local sharing is also a thing Shoutout to commissioners Clyburn and Rosenworcel the only commissioners on the board with balls and the only women on it lol On advice of security we need to take a brief recess I will never in my life understand these people who are in favor of this repeal Like they want government out of their lives but are perfectly okay with telecom companies and corporations playing them like a marionette Serious cognitive dissonance that these people are too stupid to even realize British here but will say this Repealing free and open net would make companies be greedy and package This will be a MAJOR fall for lots of websites that rely on ads and people It can make games die out If ISPs decide to service package games like steam battlenet etc Then gaming industry is going to be affected tldr Ajit Pai is a cunt I cant wait for the  letter agencies to not investigate the millions of cases of identity theft America is an oligarchyhttpwwwbbccomnewsblogsechochambers and nothing about this is news for those who pay attention However this should be a sign clear as day that this beyond all doubt is completely true Let the record show that three Republicans are voting for it and two Democrats are voting against it This is not new eitherhttpsnpredditcomrreactiongifscommentsemzllmrwwhenthefrontpageofredditisallpronetdqkitr No party is completely blameless for where we are at this point in our history but please for the love of god let this forever dispel the bullshit argument that both parties are the same Why the fuck do five people get to make a decision this big that affects millions of people The live stream just showed the vote getting shut down and everyone evacuated for a security threat Its very disappointing that our government chooses to ignore millions of citizens and make a decision against them but I have hope for the future I hope that in ISPs becoming shittier it will create the market need for some disrupter Be it Elon Musk launching satelites or some redditer launching their own ISPhttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsetuxiamaguywhosetupalowlatencyruralwireless I think people are fed up with Comcast ATT and the rest of the shitshow and its only a matter of time before some visionary creates an internet company that actually doesnt screw over their customers It may take a decade but my hope is that maybe there will be a nonshitty ISP in the future deleted Ajit Pai seems like a massive cunt Edit Thanks for the gold kind person This sucks it really does However this isnt the end of net neutrality Comcast and other internet providers think that thisll slip under the radar that after a few months of peace and quiet we will become complacent We need to prove them wrong Keep contacting our senators not to stop the FCC but to approve of a national Net Neutrality LAW Contact local senators to get state laws I know Comcast wanted stipulations that there could not be local laws supporting title two net number but I dont think that got in the final bill If theres a court case which there probably will be support that I know its hard with no end goal in sight But never let this become normal Dont go quietly into that goodnight Fight all the way Dont forget net neutrality They want to censor the internet next month in my country Luckily its democratic here and if   people sign a petition then well have a country wide vote if we want to keep our freedom I already signed it last month Seeing how people in the USA can push through a law that is against the will of the people by paying some senators money just screams capitalism Your government is not functioning well Anytime the right brings up both sides many sides show them the voting record The GOP has betrayed us too many times this year alone and no longer deserve to be in office House Vote

corporate interests with liberty and justice for those who can afford it Thanks for being supportive of the fight first of all It is disappointing but we can still try and make it better instead of complaining Its troubling that the chairman plowed forward without caring about public concern it shows the state of peoples priorities when in power I hadnt listened to Ajit speak until now against Net Neutrality His points are disingenuous and flat out lies I hate him FCC just now chose to roll back Net Neutrality Congratulations Canada youre now land of the free Stop voting for Republicans They dont care about you They care about money Yeah lets keep pretending emails and calls will work CLEARLY they dont give  shits what people say Money and only money talks Democracy in America is a complete sham Several billionaires are having a collective wank right now We need a net neutrality amendment to the constitution Im sick of living in this world genuinely I used to have so many plans things I wanted to achieve and every day it feels like this administration is taking another stair off the ladder that would have let me get there I lost my health care after Trump took office our taxes are going to go up when we could already barely afford them and now the internet is going to get a corporate chokehold and my business runs on the internet so now I dont even know if Ill be able to get my customers to visit my shop without paying extra for the privilege So I just want to say Thank you Grandpa Jim for voting to ruin my and all of your other grandchildrens lives well never forget or forgive Welp we all know how to fix this Elect Progressives get rid of conservatives and those funded by Comcast Verizon or other lobbyists Elections have consequences Lets not repeat this in  and  Serious question Is it possible to create a new internet Is there a list of every congressperson who voted against Net Neutrality so I know who to not vote for next round httpswwwfacebookcompgTheHillvideosrefpageinternal one feed still up bomb sniffing dogs around it now See it would be one thing if there was a significant portion of the population that was for whatever reason fighting for the repeal of NN It would be insane but youd have to accept okay well I guess people wanted this But there was ABSOLUTELY NOBODY that wanted this unless they had connections to ISPs Nobody Say what you want about Trump Hillary whatever THIS is pure corruption Its seems to me that all of the writing to congressmen and posting comments on the FCCs site and other protests are useless Theres only one way to fix this  with our votes Vote in every election and vote for candidates who vow to support net neutrality Youre never going to change the minds of any congressman with letters Forget changing their minds  we have to change them out for someone else Dont bother appealing to them Instead focus on educating and appealing to the voting public If we want a free and open internet then as a nation we have vote out those that oppose that Fire the fuckers Shift from focusing on Net Neutrality to the removal and humiliation of Ajit Pai Well keep having corrupt autocrats trying to pass it every few years if we dont make an example out of him Wtf is going on Security ordered everyone out of the room We need a lawsuit I will happily contribute to a fund for said lawsuit I wrote email letters okay technically postcards and faxes as well as commenting on the FCC website and what did I accomplish along with millions of other Americans Nothing Absolutely nothing Were beyond the point where letters and calls are effective They dont care This is no longer a functioning democracy It has fallen to corruption and corporate interest The video Pai made is the most cringey thing Ive seen in my entire life Lets hope we can keep net neutrality In the interest of security we need to take a break He knows hes about to become the most hated man in America A tough feat This is what happens when you just stomp on the little guy We all preach compliance and nonviolencebut people feel backed into a corner after a while Im sure someone just phoned in a bomb threat or something The shit eating grin on Pais face after the  vote rpunchablefaces Son of a bitch rat bastards Internet access is a utility Plain and simple Were completely fucked when federal regulatory agencies are in favor of private sector operations It is complete BUNK how  people can decide the fate of something as huge as this Measures this large shouldnt be at the will of  peopleat least bring it to the house or senate where elected officials of the people sitnot some back door committee appointed by whomever is in power And how it isnt a conflict of interest to have Pai who is Verizon patsy at the head of this always amazes me Yes but have you considered Please enter credit card information if you want to view comment   exp   ccv   Ajit Pai Michael ORielly and Brendan CarrThis is the legacy you leave you children and your childrens children It will last longer in history than any sum of money you were paid for this unjust violation of a basic civil right You allowed this bribery and corruption to change the people of America from human beings to simple products that corporations can simply by and sell This generation and the generations after will never let you or your legacy be forgotten Wakeup fellow humans of this counrty Your vote has and never will ever matter to the likes of these people They live in a world where they are above us and look down on us as unintelligent sheep I along with every single person I could reach out to emailed called and everything else for nothing If this and everything else that is happening without our consent does not open your eyes to how things are now you are blind I am from a military family and served with honor and I am beside myself The blatant we do not care what you say is not only troubling it is down right scary So sad were we are headed Thanks I think us netizens did a great job and everything we could to spread awareness And we can still do more This policy certainly isnt set in stone I would have liked to see more support from the likes of Google and Netflix I see they have some presence such as Googles page herehttpswwwgooglecomtakeactionactionfreeandopenindexhtml but its really quite different from the SOPA and PIPA days Do you have any insight into why they havent been active on this issue Long term creating fast lanes is going to hurt the tech startup scene I didnt believe GoogleNetflix had turned completely greedy until I saw their lack of presence on this issue as compared to SOPAPIPA the hell happened they took a recess under advice from security Wait did the FCC just adjourn for security reasons Thank you reddit for everything you did That gif of the loading icon really helped All title II says is you cannot discriminate Why would you want to repeal unless you plan on discriminating I have not seen a good argument as to why it needs to be repealed It incentivizes investment is the only one that begins to make sense but they have no data and its like the rd argument behind the internet is free so there should be no regulation I dont see how regulation has hurt the internet Woah I was just watching the live feedhttpswwwcnncomspecialslivevideoadkeybn and Ajit Pai was giving his prepared speech and someone handed him a note and he instructed the room evacuate immediately saying Bringing only your bodies and police walked in the room Then the feed cut Edit Feeds back on from other sources looks like theyre sweeping the room with scanners and dogs Moar Edit Theyre back in the room with shiteating grins of course Also it looks like other streams didnt drop out Didnt mean to be sensationalist Holy shit Did the FCC just clear out due to a threat Which one of you people placed a call HOW DO WE AS A PEOPLE INTERRUPT THE LIVES OF OUR CORRUPT PURVEYORS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY PURPOSEFULLY AND VORACIOUSLY INTERRUPT THE LIVES OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY This is why I hate these politician cocksuckers so much Despite everyone telling him vro you are WRONG dont repeal Net Neutrality he does it anyway Anyone who follows blind conviction and doesnt have the guts to admit being wrong is not fit to make any decisions in their own life let alone the entire fucking country I love how out of touch they are Being condescending as fuck saying the internets for memes and geeks And not to mention the straight up lying and contradiction One of them was talking about how we didnt need a public hearing on this case since we had the forum Right after saying that he didnt care about the forum dismissing complaints as simple messages having the same meaning and then complaining about how they called him mean names All of this while just ignoring the points the ladies made about how this could very easily get out of hand without regulation Dont forget that it may be possible to repeal this on the state levelhttpwwwspokesmancomstoriesdecwashingtonwillkeepnetneutralityinstateiffc at least Definitely not a great solution especially since states like Alabama that especially need free information probably wont pass it But its a start They just stopped the vote because of a security issue On advice of security were going to take a recess Whats going on Clyburn rocked that shit A huge thank you to the chairwomen and their statements  Theres a bomb threat now apparently A bomb threat has occurred in the FCC hall The meeting may have been postponed It is time for dossiers on every Board member of an ISP to find dirt on them and expose that dirt so that they get replaced until they are pro net neutrality Same with politicians as they need to be replaced as well We need new leaders in these places that actually know how to create good products as ISPs only know how to price gouge in a sleazy and unfriendly way To quote The Big Short This level of corruption is unprecedented even for the government Michael OReilly obliviously states Everybody please take a deep breath  we do not and will not block throttle or discriminate against lawful content Moron  the problem is that you CAN do that now NOBODY should have that right I just called both my senators I would like to remind people to spent  minutes and make these calls They said they had other people call regarding this issue but they are not being flooded by tons of calls regarding this You have to call You cant post something on Facebook or upvote stuff on Reddit the government isnt seeing a wave of outrage at whats happening because not enough of you are calling Do it right now The phone systems should be down due to the traffic if we are doing what we need to do Its also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong enforceable net neutrality rules good fucking joke SECURITY BREACH AT FCC MEETING Watching live Security interrupted the meeting and rushed everyone out of the room The mics have been cut Mics still live with some news outlets Fox Politico CBS with commentary More sources appreciated No Update People coming back into the room No word yet on the cause of the security breach Update  Piece Ashit picks up where he left off Whoa what is happening with the room clearing edit There is a dog in there bomb threat maybe Security has ordered everybody to evacuate before Ajit Pai could finalize his vote Around  minutes ago they cut the feed and left the room under the urging of security Does anyone know whats going on yet removed Power corrupts Absolute power corrupts absolutely Your government my dear Americans is absolutely corrupt Good luck My personal belief is that all our work and dedication just pushed them to further their agenda even more Seeing how much people care gave them fuel to shove it down our throat because they now know how much everyone cares about the NetNeutrality They have no shame no personal beliefs no humanity no sense of self regulation All they care about money and power And now they know how much power they have and much more money they can sap out of our hard worked pockets The battle is lost but the population can rise togheter and battle the bunch of puppets over there Go out and vote for the people that care about you instead of voting for your party Left and right dont matter anymore vote for humans not sock puppets removed Very frustrating You know what else is frustrating That probably most people on here have not voted Thats how you get Trump and Pai with k votes and theyre here to stay Obama was right  elections have consequences My frustration is that the people who try to do the right thing and those who dont give a damn suffer those consequences together We can send this Pai dick letters until all the trees in the world are depleted it wont matter What matters is voting so people like this never come to power Will you be making another thread for the House vote as well Nice bit of important

including  percent of Democrats and  percent of Republicans favored keeping the Obamaera rules lmao key wording bolded Remember that in a few months were going to have to repeat the cycle because of the  people on the senate who voted no Something something win the battle but the wars long from over  Im not in the US but have been following this issue somewhat hard not to with it being all over reddit But  sounds incredibly close which makes me think that without the help of people here that would be a very different result I know that if it had went the other way it would affect more than just people in the US but in a lot of other places too so thanks everyone who put time  effort into this whole thing Edit okay glad to hear that  isnt as close as i initially thought  Trump is known to change his mind from time to time Understatement of the year folks This is a big win for us all but we have to remember to still stay vigilant in the future this will likely be a fight for years to come Is there a good chance the Republican House and Trump will sign off on this theres the house to go through and trump hopefully politicians finally get it through their heads that the public wants this We did it Reddit WAR FLASHBACKS Eat shit Ajit drinks from an even larger Reeses mug This is great but there arent the votes in the House to pass the measure which would be the next step Whats the plan going forward Is there a realistic expectation that the House will pass the measure and that POTUS will sign it What does the vote count look like right now Just messaged my congressman I know folks are in the midst of celebrating the win for net neutrality but I know that theres a long and difficult road ahead The road leads through the offices of you and your colleagues I pray that you and others will consider how important equal and unrestricted access to the information superhighway is How much do you trust your cable provider Do you truly believe that they and other market players will act to the benefit of the people If we as consumers had choices perhaps things would be different I consider myself blessed to have access to a local fiber based system Others are not so fortunate The Cox ATTs and DirecTVs of the world will always and forever act only in their best interests Not long ago you were paying your phone bill by the minute That rapidly changed to an unlimited plan Do you think it cost more to maintain the network then than it does now Theres the difference an unregulated market works when the consumer has a choice I know that its unlikely youll read this message but if people like me remain silent youll only hear the loudest and stupidest of your constituents If you ever want to meet wth me Ill buy the coffee It is terrifying the amount of energy it takes us to overtake these issues and these are just the ones we happen to be passionate about But having been to city municipal meetings a few times it makes sense that politicians instantly discount the plebs It must be infuriating to interact with the unwashed masses Well dressed scotchbuying lobbyists with a checkbook must be extremely hard to ignore Dont even worry about a veto this will never get to the House floor for a vote It got to a floor vote in the senate via a discharge petition A discharge petition is a tool where if you get enough senators to support a measure it bypasses the committee of jurisdiction and goes right to the floor Once it passes the senate the measure is than sent to the House of Representative where it is held at the desk per statute So since its at the desk in the House there is no way to get a floor vote unless the majority party schedules it A discharge petition doesnt apply in the House because its not referred to a house committee it will just sit at the desk Midterm elections are coming up Look up the  who voted no and see if you can vote against them Ajit Pai is probably too busy with a mouth full of corporate cock to comment about this its not over make sure you call your representative to tell them too All thanks to our gracious Chancellor Palp I mean the Senate Thank the Democrats Every single one of them voted in favor of Net Neutrality And no duh this issue has  popularity in the USA Yet  of Republicans opposed it It will be an uphill battle in the House but it shouldnt be Just try to convince me theres no difference My dad was so brainwashed that he believed the issue reversed He thinks that the liberals keep pushing net neutrality to raise his internet bill Just to give everyone perspective on why this issue isnt voted to oblivion Keep informing everyone you know Remember when you go to the polls  Democrats voted for net neutrality  Republicans voted for net neutrality  and todays vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us Well the Dems and  Republicans in your Senate The other  Republicans dont give a fuck about you no matter what rprematurecelebration If reddit simply banded with other major sites and refused to serve their site up to any ISP that throttled sites then it would be over Wouldnt take all the sites just like  large ones No google amazon Facebook Netflix Hulu etc and bam no more net neutrality issue And it had absolutely nothing to do with the barrage of posts on every fucking subreddit a few months ago Celebrate tonight and tomorrow repair the fortifications They will be back and in greater numbers Ok you guys really need to quit touting this as the greatest WIN This isnt a WIN it is the first step You need to be letting people know that the fight is still on and that they now need to be blowing up their house reps phones I didnt know we were going to be pushing politics  We did it Reddit I wouldnt use that wording but yay Im typically all in for deregulation but it this case Im not Ending net neutrality gives us the worst of both worlds We still have anti competition laws that enforce monopolies and duopolies while giving ISPs the freedom to enact anti consumer practices Ideally I could just switch providers if I didnt like what my current one was doing but I only have one choice for fast Internet in my area Combine this with the fact that the barrier to entry in the ISP market is too high to allow for real competition except for between a handful of giant companies In todays day and age the Internet is just as crucial to our standard of living as electricity is It should be regulated like a utility The Democrats and  Republicans of the Senate have voted to restore Net Neutrality Dont give credit where it isnt due This is the literal definition of a partisan issue and the Republicans will vote against it en masse due to their selfish interests The both parties are the same argument is as dumb of a statement as Red and green are the same because theyre both colors deleted We did it reddit Doesnt matter will be dead in the water in the house Even if by a miracle House passes it Trump will veto it This will therefore just become a key campaign issue in the midterms So we need this to pass in the house and then we need it to not be vetoed by Trump As a Republican for  years Id like to say this is not a party issue I urged both my senators to vote for net neutrality I will do the same once this reaches the House I have also put my party on notice they should also support the electorate rather than their campaign financiers So to all the other Republicans out there who believe in freedom over corporate profit I urge them to contact not only their Representative but also their local and state party and let them know how you feel Lol why are people voting against net neutrality Nice lets celebrate by exchanging beers with one another on reddit braces self for ban You said the Senate rprequelmemes incoming We did it leddit le upboat for u xDDD Man fuck that ass clown Ajit Nobody expected anything different  its the House where it faces its opposition and will likely die Why would  vote to discard net neutrality The internet and assuming majority of people seems to want to keep net neutrality desperately Heres the list of democrats who voted for Ajit Paihttpswwwcongressgovnominationthcongress to be FCC chair in the first place Manchin DWV McCaskill DMO Peters DMI Tester DMT Dont celebrate just yet A miracle will need to happen for this to pass the House and Trump See you all again same time and place next year probably I love that you are political on this issue but its sad that you play apolitical except when it is only in your own financial best interests Net neutrality is just a distraction Fucking wired news paywall Got any links to a decent news site that isnt backwards thinking  Who are the  idiots who gave reddit gold to a reddit admin Here lies ajit pai Press F to shit in his grave todays vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us Well  of them at least The scary part of this just how many were willing to sell us out in the senate Almost half the senate didnt have our best interests in mind Remember that next time you vote can someone explain in short what they are trying to take away and what will be taken away if they win  and who is trying to take away  I love democracy ITT Reddit hates Republicans good job guiz now big co can get promoted on search engines instead of smaller businesses fueling monopolies goddamit fucking shit Now we need to win the vote in the House which will be much more difficult But maybe theyll be more receptive to people contacting them since the Republicans are in danger of losing the majority Doesnt Trump have to sign off on it even if it passes the House though Thats the biggest worry I have Even if it passes the House we have to deal with him and he definitely hates net neutrality Hopefully this is as far as this foolish and immoral legislation goes Keep the government away from the internet Keep the internet free I was an intern on Capitol Hill a few years ago and would like to give a little more insight into what happens when you call your representative  Your call is going to be answered by either a lowpaid overworked Staff Assistant or often times an unpaid overworked intern BE POLITE I cant tell you how many times someone called yelling at an intern to make the world perfect  My office recorded down the content of the calls the position of the caller on the issue and where they are from If the caller was not from the constituency then would politely direct them to their own Representative If they were nice I would even look up their Rep or Senator and give them their office number  It may also be beneficial to know that the staffinterns answering phone calls are given scripts pertaining to specific positions or lack of position that a RepSen may have Its not worth it to argue with internsStaff Assistants because we are just telling callers what we are told to say Deviating from the script may lead to social media or other posts saying something like a source within SenReps office today confirmed that the SenReps real position is  on the issue of pepsi vs coca cola  The SenatorRepresentative will get a tally at the end of the week telling them how many people called about what issue not about the specific content of the calls It basically is something like  people called in support of net neutrality  people called in support of legalizing hemp etc It is important to Keep your expectations low Senators and Representatives have busy schedules and will not take constituent calls  of the time even if you ask to talk to the SenatorRepresentative Again be polite The people answering the phones are literally at the bottom of the food chain and can also have bad days too You would be surprised with what kindness can do I was willing to take a few extra steps to help people along every time someone was nice and polite EDIT Included script information EDIT  Im working a job right now that employs Administrative Assistants and I blended the two positions together in my mind so replaced Administrative Assistants with Staff Assistants Please lets not become desensitized to the persistence of those who wish to rob us of our freedoms Youve seen the posts red with white lettering We did this  months ago We did but the fight isnt over Do the right thing and fight for your freedom Both on the internet and off Because everyday of your life someone will be trying to put a price on your existence I always find these latenight announcement posts strange is there a reason you guys do them so late sometimes Like was this meant to be posted earlier today but got delayed because I would think this would have better visibility in the AM in the US since it is a US issue deleted As a Congressional aide you need to be leaving you FIRST AND LAST NAME as well as FULL STREET ADDRESS when leaving voicemails or calling your rep Also please speak CLEARLY I cant tell you how many opinions weve had to toss out when someone calls our office when we are closed and the voicemail doesnt have any information that could differentiate between the  Marks in Greenfield My boss is on the good side when it comes to Net Neutrality and we make a good faith effort to record your opinions even with incomplete information can you imagine what Sen McConnell or Rep Ryans offices do when you leave incomplete information DELETE Else what A GOP controlled Congress will kill net neutrality Tell them unless net neutrality is protected your seat will be replaced with someone who will Make this an issue in the midterm deleted Just a question if someone would like to answer Im from Australia and curious as to whether this effects me Im assuming it doesnt I accept abuse for being stupud Theres a certain amount of irony in Reddit admins requesting our help in protecting net neutrality while they shelter a community that repeatedly violates Reddits TOS and uses the platform to support those trying to tear down NN As a Canadian I legitimately thought you were referring to the Canadian Revenue Agency CRA for a second there In college I knew people who worked as aids for state representatives When there were massive callin campaigns they took it extremely seriously They can tell the difference between an intense and heavily supported campaign from a tepid one Call your representatives it makes a difference We gotta clutch this one out redditors  this may be a turning point in internet history Ive got no faith in the FCC but lets muster what little faith we have for our corrupt government to not screw this one up  Fuck this distraction Congress is voting tomorrow on eliminating section  of the Communications Decency Act Why is CDA  important With CDA  If Reddit gets sued for a users comment the suit gets dismissed If Facebook gets sued for a users comment the suit gets dismissed If your blog gets sued for a users comment the suit gets dismissed Without CDA  If MySpace got sued in  MySpace would have ceased to exist If Facebook got sued in  Facebook would have ceased to exist If Reddit got sued in  Reddit would have ceased to exist Why does this matter Doesnt Reddit deserve to get sued for comments made by TD users FUCK NO Think of it like this Your racist uncle posts a comment on your blog about whatever Regardless of what your uncle said you get sued for that comment Do you deserve that or does your uncle deserve that In this fictional scenario your uncle deserves to get sued OK you think obviously I dont deserve to get sued but obviously Reddit Facebook Twitter and MySpace deserve it Sorry but no We all started somewhere Reddit started off as just a couple of usershttpswwwredditcomrmildlyinfuriatingcommentsywejkthethandtholdestredditusers Facebook started off as some college students meeting each other MySpace started off as a couple of Toms friends If the FOSTA bill passes tomorrow then nothing happens to the biggest companies on the internet Google Facebook Apple Microsoft Reddit Amazon Twitter and others are fine Theyre big enough that they can hire enough lawyers to fend off any suits The problem is the next generation will NEVER have a chance The second they try to get started theyll get sued out of existence because of one random user  How does this affect you Have you heard of Slack Discord Both of those companies are new small and trying to get started If they got sued and couldnt win without CDA  then theyre both gone Can your startup survive that suit Can your neighbors Can your childs  Fuck this distraction and  FUCK FOSTA CDA  gave us the Internet we have today Dont let congress keep the next social network picture sharing site or blog from becoming the next big thing  If only the constitution stated Thou may have infinite access to pornography without having to pay extra fees for internet we wouldnt be having this debate ITT astroturfing If youre still unsure of the best way to contact your representatives about this or any issue I cant possibly recommend Resist Bothttpsresistbot enough It makes it incredibly simple to get in touch with your representatives Internet still works ITT People who have been convinced that continuing the prevention of internet slow lanes as weve done for the entire history of the modern internet is somehow handing the internet over to the state and has anything to do with government censorship My time to shine Oh not this shit again I have very little faith in American government It goes to the highest bidder and unless any of you live on Wallstreet I doubt any of this will go anywhere Sorry I just need to put my pessimism somewhere The government needs a complete do over before anything good happens This is our chance to be part of something important dont let it pass you by Use your voice Wow lmao TD is heavy in this thread I hope if NN tanks their extremist havens just crumble STOP THE FCC Did call many DC offices thank you for the excellent post I hate to be a bit shady but Id like to change the sticky advertisement for this post please It would take a spot of integration but throw this in the the sticky title  FREE REDDIT GOLD IF YOU MAKE FIVE CALLS I wish Reddit admins would post about how isps have colluded with local governments instead Id rather fight the cancer than treat the symptoms Upvote the Downvote Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality Wed have more success crowdfunding enough money to bribe sufficient corrupt politicians into doing the honest thing  members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions Hilariously nave Whats the argument for saving net neutrality Eternal Vigilance is the price we pay for democracy Heres something that would help Midterm ballot cheat sheets that show who is proNN Id chip in to get that built What can i do as a Canadian to help out There is a number you can text that automatically sends an email to your local congressman I like how you guys want to save net neutrality while enacting policies that certain subs will be banned if they sell certain entirely legal items that reddit has chosen to disallow All the while turning a blind eye to far more destructive items What a joke Save net neutrality to allow the internet to be a platform for all Small businesses are victim just as much as us individual users New businesses require an internet platform to succeed nowadays Competitive small business is a capitalists key to technological advance This recent repeal is an enemy to this Save net neutrality in order to secure a more advanced and fulfilled society in the future It starts now First tell them to make a th amendment for getting private money out of politics Net neutrality wouldnt be in jeopardy if they did that I emailed my state senator and he emailed back They care They are here for us and are listening currently defending us and fighting for us in all ways possible Dont be afraid to speak out Stand tall and be proud There are millions of Americans that feel the same way as you do This is OUR fight We have to come together in this matter We need YOU Please actually contact them Dont just upvote this post Time is running out Why is the scorecard split along party lines generally Honest question here what do Republicans have to gain by opposing Net Neutrality Having to constantly campaign for my basic rights is getting real fucking old Equating Congressional action to Reddits system of upvotingdownvoting is disengenuous to how Congress works Why is this a Reddit announcement Didnt OneMoreVote start like months ago How have we NOT gotten it by now General Reposti deleted The scorecard basically boils down to Dems  For Reps  Against If we actually want anything to move forward we should be targeting specific Republican reps in tight districts or with interests less tied to the industry line If you live in Sacramento Ca and you want to get involved in the Net Neutrality movement you can also join CodeSac httpsozmediacollectivewistiacommediasutkcfdqgl Once again Republicans voting against the interests of the people I live in Qubec Canada How can I help I genuinely have no clue and would very much like to do something about this is there anyway for me to help just a little Being military can I call both the representative for my home of record and the representative for where Im stationed How do you kill that which has no life Is there any point is tweeting representatives and senators for whom I am not a constituent Both my senators and my rep are already proNN so Im not sure I can do anything  I have no faith in any form of government anymore I know Its a bad attitude but its the world view that I have Good Luck America As long as Republicans control both Houses of Congress I am skeptical a dialogue of any kind can take place on Capital Hill Sadly I doubt a bill confirming the sky is blue could get through either House with a simple majority at this point in time That being said there is an election this year and by all indications Democrats stand to make huge gains I think we need to focus our efforts on lobbying current and future elected officials who might agree with us Assuming nothing can happen until early  how can we make sure something happens on day one and how can we educate our representatives on what action they can take when the time comes im not taking marching orders from reddit admins lmao As a Canadian at first I had to question how the Canadian Revenue Agency could save net neutrality Good luck to our friends down south As a Canadian I was so confused by the title because I thought they were talking about the Canadian Revenue Agency which is the IRS equivalent here lol Im antinet neutrality though This fight has truly become exhausting The FCC have purposefully ommitted our petitions from public discourse they have ignored our very lawful attempts to silence the repeal before it ever drew breath and quite possibly the worst part of all Both Pai and the providers that bribed pardon me  lobbied him are going to be in fits of laughter on their way to the bank as they charge all of us innate sums of money for services already owed to us by our own tax dollars they so casually pocketed over  decades ago There can be no doubt that these times are trying us We must try them back Write Call Vote It does not matter what we do so long as we all act This opportunity may appear grim after the dismal last few years weve seen in this fight but the door is quite far from closed Try Write Call Vote Act Now Support ballot initiatives to create municipal fiber optic internet utilities Get better internet service and drive the private ISPs out of business deleted deleted As someone in the UK I feel helpless in this situation but I can clearly see how this is going to affect the world Is there any way us international people can help Wow this post is really being bombarded with triggered td users I live in Ireland and net neutrality being repealed in the US would seriously affect me personally My girlfriend lives in Arkansas and the only way I can contact her and have for the last year and a half is through the internet Skype Discord etc Ive forwarded this to her but what can I do personally as someone who is not a US citizen to help with the cause of saving net neutrality I dont want to feel helpless here and I want to do something Ok Heres the thing I feel completely powerless I live in Austin Texas My Senators are Ted Cruz  from ISPs John Cornyn  and Representative Michael McCaul  monetary amounts taken from The Verges article on Congresss intake from ISPshttpswwwthevergecomnetneutralityfccispcongresscampaigncontribution Today I tweeted the message to all three I emailed all three I called all three it went to voicemail and then told me their mailboxes were full I did all the same back in December before the repeal I never voted for these guys I have ZERO faith that they will do anything but side with ISPs and keep taking their buyout dollars Im so very tired I hear you on the perseverance is key But in Texas right now I feel Ive been given to the knackers Maybe its better the way it is now where the FCC has relinquished its ability to regulate the internet Do we really want that cunt Ajit Pai in charge I believe some very big states California for example are moving towards legislating a real net neutrality If they succeed it may force ISPs to enforce net neutrality in mostall of the US For example Californias regulations on car emissions forced auto manufacturers to reduce emissions in CA leading to reduced emissions in cars sold everywhere else If the FCC takes charge again its likely those big states will be satisfied and stop any potential legislation Perhaps were in a situation where its better if big states like CA feels like theyre forced to put some net neutrality on the books Is the CRA our last hope Going to call asap Cant wait for Reddit to be crippled again because of the NN spam  of the world cant do anything about it and Id wager that  at this point  anyone who cares to be informed already is NN is important but please keep this in mind when youre posting NN stuff around Some of us just want our daily dose of animegamespornshitposts and we cant do that when Reddit is either blank because of RES filters or full of irrelevant stuff Sorry I already died from the net neutrality repeal Why are you posting this at around midnight eastern time Since this is an issue highly relevant to the whole world what can I as a nonamerican do right now TD is so obsessed with triggering liberal snowflakes that they are literally pretending to oppose net neutrality Kek Today is the net neutrality dayofaction and I am proud to share what I have done to work with you to protect the internet as we know it During the past year alone I have sent four letters to the FCC to urge them to maintain protections for the open internet have sponsored an amendment to reiterate the critical role net neutrality plays for our educators and students and have cosponsored legislation to prevent the FCC from taking rash action without appropriate review Now that the FCC has decided to ignore your input and go forward with repealing net neutrality even after such a dramatic outcry I am sponsoring legislation to force the FCCs hand and overturn their shortsighted decision With your ongoing help I will continue to advocate for the open internet so that all Americans can access the internet without throttling blocking or paid prioritization Jared Congressman Polis So is it because we are about to reach the sixty day limit the net neutrality fear mongering is back I got really tired of it back then so hopefully in a week I will never have to hear about this again deleted Infuriating how many of my senators are still red Youd think this would be a no brainer Ill be calling first thing tomorrow We were all disappointed in the decision How can you speak for everyone Not taking any sides just pointing out the obvious Why does reddit use an announcement to push a political post Not very professional Didnt we all die when it got killed Give them hell reddit in the nicest way fuck ajit Last time I heard something about it werent individual states going to make their own regulationslaws about NN Either way I still will contact my senator for our internet freedom D Nah Im fine with the decision to repeal net neutrality If you think net neutrality limits competition why are the companys who have the most to lose with competition supporting this repeal so hard I hope this works Poat Dont let them play the word games with you either You tell them you want the fcc ruling overturned They will try to tell you that they support a free internet While meaning they support the ruling since it would be free from regulation Sadly people only care if its some massive hype fest like  mths ago my friends only cared because they got hyped up AFTER I told them to care Like years after even Why post so late BOoooooo Leave the FCC alone you loons Unless you have lots of money and are willing to donate to a campaign those people couldnt give less fucks about what you or I or everyone wants Im so over this You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on this scoreboard No I cant without digging Please make your link show Congress members stances on all devices Im not from USA but i would still like to help if net neutrality loses in USA its only a matter of time before some fat pleb decides its good idea to speed those rules in other countries or places in desire to earn money This is a worldwide issue and i have been sporting net neutrality in the past what can be done Lets hope we can get this through Incoming this post will get locked watch Anyone ever think that if Comcast and Verizon are saying Net Neutrality is a good thing that it may not be Save net neutrality How about Reddit introducing content neutrality Because this seems incredibly hypocritical Reddit wants others to not control what goes over their platform but have complete control over theirs Congress is pretty much controlled by the corrupt asshats that want this repealed and the majority party has cultivated a voting base that will let them get away with pretty much anything I feel like none of this matters anymore Not until those people are gone I feel like theres never anything I can do on these things I live in NH which leans pretty democrat so all my Congressional representatives already support this as they have with all things Net Neutrality Is there anything else I can do please stop the FCC As a permanent CEO Or are you guys temping it again Steve Why are you moderator for rcannibals  edit well this blew up and I can be happy about gold again Thanks  continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward Could you elaborate more on which goals or projects were started by Ellen and will be picked up by Steve Thanks deleted Ellen Ellen Ellen Oh wait thats not Ellen Steve StevehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvFBfcdPKwE Edit gold x Thanks Hey Steve We met a long time ago but Im sure you dont remember I created redditgifts and was let go from reddit a month ago I wonder if you have any intention of keeping redditgifts around in the future Friday afternoon eh Someone took a PR class in college Welcome back StevehttpimgurcomvoAnPy Ok Hi Its Steve Im super excited to be back Its been a crazy day Ill be spending the next hour or so in the this thread answering any questions and then I need to do some serious bonding with the team here Weve got a lot of work to do Fortunately Ive got five years of ideas stacked up and Im looking forward to getting to work edit taking off for a bit Lots to do here edit Im going to do an Office Hours  AMA tomorrow morning am pst I think we need some quality time together reddit How did you find your job as CEO I cant find anywhere to apply for as a CEO on indeedcom Will this actually change things for historys sake  points  upvoted  votes and just got the th gold as the clock hit  minutes in edit    minutes  points  upvoted  votes and

golds to the op  Is there any chance Victoria will be returning  What is happening with that  million dollars that was supposed to go back into the community  Do you feel that the influx of monetary influence has caused some of these how shall we say growing pains  Are you concerned about the sudden talk of alternatives to reddit ie voatco  Are you concerned about history repeating itself like diggcom  What lessons did you learn from digg and how will you make different choices to avoid a mass exodus  Whats your favorite cat related content youve seen this week Pao was not the only issue with Reddit simply the face Lets make sure we help to change this site for the better It sounds like Pao served her role as the interim CEO perfectly People were supposed to hate her so she could make changes the board of directors wanted that they knew some users would hate Then the white knight new CEO sweeps in to save the day and everyone is happy They also promise to continuo Paos mission to make this a safe place so that should be fun deleted Hey Steve its Dacvak We briefly met a long time ago when I first got hired Please let me know if you have any positions open for Community Manager as I would love to return once Im healthy enough to do so  Im so excited to have Steve back with us He helped build this platform that has been such a huge part of my life for the better part of a decade    I cant think of anyone better for the next decade deleted I wasnt consulted about this This is such a huge placation They brought in Ellen to make really unpopular changes and now they are bringing back Steve to have everyone believe Reddit is going back to normal Theres no turning back from the size this site has become and feigning that we can do anything with it other than move to a new smaller site is just silly Reddit will continue to exist despite its users being upset because its reached a cultural critical mass Reddit is popular because its popular and for no other reason I dont mean to be negative but seriouslythis was planned Steve got a ton of money and wont be able to make any changes without the Boards approvaljust like Ellen Meet the new boss same as the old boss Wasnt the default sub blackout due to mods years of frustration with reddit admins Like years before Pao joined on board Or are we just gonna pretend that Pao didnt get a lot of misdirected hatred from the blackout I knew Ellen Pao would step down she was only the face people could punch while the higher ups made unpopular changes to reddit People saw this coming from a mile away anyone who considers this a victory needs to look at what is actually changing which isnt the policies introduced under Pao I watched this post go over  votes but now its back down to under  I recall this is an automatic function of Reddit but is there any way to see the actual votes on a post and not this market adjusted version I have no strong feelings about this one way or another Well now who is reddit going to scapegoat with all of their angst Welcome back Steve While I doubt well ever find out exactly what changes were a direct command from Ellen the one that I found most curious was demanding all employees move to San Francisco To me one of the successes of reddit was how all of these amazingly talented people from across the globe could work together without HAVING to be together With a global reach for staffing youre able to have the best team possible but by demanding geographics youre limiting yourself to whose willing to movedeal with the cost of living in San Francisco etc I understand that facetoface workingmeeting is different than virtual but where I work because of geography we simply cant be all be in the same place and thats just the reality of it There is no way to congregate everyone We trust everyone to perform their roles have a reporting process and meet regularly through teleconference and video conference When reddit announcedcommanded that everyone must move to San Francisco to remain employed I saw that as the end to reddit as it was Even if everybody moved youd have a lot of people who didnt want to and were leaving their homesfamilieslives Having happy employees is more important than a punch clockphysical presence especially for a virtual company Yes there are SOME jobs that should be physically together the physical servers of reddit are somewhere so theoretically someone who needs to be switch things on and off needs to be near them but reddit functions  so having people spread across the globetime zones would benefit the operation I know this isnt an AMA but Im curious whether you Steve are going to step back and evaluate all of reddit and consider making big moves that may look like going backwards because that worked I also appreciate that we dontcant know why uchooter was terminated but if the rumours of her disagreeing with the changes of her role are the root cause I would hope that youd be open enough to consider that someone whose been in the role should be listened to for their opinions Im not suggesting you hire uchooter back but if the reason for her termination was a disagreement with someone who has now stepped down as CEO it would mean a lot to the users if uchooter was given the option to return  let her decide If I was Victoria Id consider it but Id be wanting a firm personal employment contract that protects me from termination without severance unless I was stealing from the company or something You pay people to be good at what they do and thinkcontribute not to be drones and do what you say If you want drones fire everyone and outsource overseas Another voice seemingly lost in all of this is ukickme who brought such positive energy and commitment to the reddit userbase Truly the reason I created my account and stopped lurking was to be part of the first Secret Santa If you check the age of my account youll see it was created within days of the first Secret Santa campaign run out of Dans home for free all to bring some joy to the world Again I doubt well know why Dan was terminated but seeing that reddit killed the store connected to redditgifts which presumably was a source of income I can only guess that reddit Inc was cutting ties with anybody who didnt agree  with what they were being told to do Same as my comment above  Dan was hired and redditgifts bought from him to contribute to the communityorganizationcompany so if he was terminated for having opinions on what he created reddit is the loser in the situation Dan will have no trouble finding another job but the chaos reddit created in his life by forcing a move and terminating him is disgraceful Put this right at the top of the list of things I thought wouldnt be happening anytime soon But seriously when has a tech company ever brought back their founder named Steve and succeeded Ill be completely buried under the comments nobody will read this but here I go Pao just did what the reddit board wanted She couldnt possibly have made those changes herself and have nobody disagree with it Reddit is getting commercialized or at least changing how they are getting their money And thats okay Better communication would have been nice Ellen Pao stepping down now will change nothing unless the board miraculously unfires the people who have been let go reinstates banned subreddits and members However since nothing in the announcement nor comments points to this being a possibility its very likely that the changes Pao took flak for will just stay there From a business and strategy perspective this has been a great move lots of people bought it and jumped on the hate bandwagon but they completely lost track of the real thing happening here and thats the structure of reddit being changed Im not opposing this Im just in for the smaller subreddits which have an awesome community and a website has got to find ways to survive and it cant just forever lean on karma and reddit gold The way it happened just doesnt seem like fair play at all But thats all gut feeling deleted removed Well now that you threw Pao under the bus is Steve the next on the chopping block when you guys do absolutely nothing different from whats been pissing off your userbase lately I mean you gotta know Pao only got shit because being a CEO paints a giant target on your head when your company fucks up We are thankful for Ellens many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally Ha Youre a funny guy She brought focus to chaos Proving she was the wrong person for the job She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions By managing to keep reddit afloat because none of its competitors could handle the influx of wannabe reddit refugees Do you really want to say she did something good when her most notable accomplishment was crashing pretty much every reddit competitor by sending them WAY too many users a pioneer for women in the tech industry When will you people let this myth die Are people contractually obligated to perpetuate this crap or what She struck a blow for women in tech much in the same way that the Rolling Stone rape hoax struck a blow for Rolling Stones credibility Many of the comments make the hate for Ellen Pao start to look like a witch hunt I dont believe one single person can have had the influence nor the responsibility to make all the decisions that have harvested such hate Then again this is often what happens Someone is made out to be the scapegoat and hate it shifted toward that person thus removing focus from the true problems Finally Its time for reddit to go back to its origins My suggestions  Bring back rredditcom  Turn off all other subreddits  Remove bloat eg the commenting feature Edit And oh my god howhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscucyeanoldteamatredditcsztoc could I forgethttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscucyeanoldteamatredditcszm  Port reddit back to Lisp  Disable selfposts Finally a mature decision Still I have suspicions that it was all just a big plan to shift all the hate on Ellen Pao for making decisions which were coming from the top Welcome back I never really hated Ellen but Im glad the drama is coming to an end Did anyone see that Buzzfeed CEO resigned and they hired someone named Heve Stufman What happened next will surprise you Is it just me or did this have a lot more upvotes earlier today Yo why did the upvotes on this post decline by k over night All those people boycotting reddit today are missing all of this deleted deleted Of note please recall that by  virtually everyone in the US should have had gigabit internet at their home work school everywhere but instead the telcos pocketed at least  billionhttpswwwhuffingtonpostcombrucekushnickthebookofbrokenpromisbhtml of tax payer money since  thats about  per household Follow up article from  Definitely read this and the previous linkhttpswwwhuffingtonpostcomentryfreedownloadthebookofbrokenpromisesbillionusddebfbfcd  By the end of  America will have been charged about  billion by the local phone incumbents Verizon ATT and CenturyLink for a fiber optic future that never showed up And though it varies by state counting the taxes fees and surcharges that you have paid every month many of these fees are actually revenues to the company or taxes on the company that you paid it comes to about  per household from  and thats the low number We were supposed to have  Mbps upload and download  In fact in  the speed of broadband as detailed in state laws was  Mbps in both directions  by  all of us should have been enjoying gigabit speeds  Mbps  The Speed of Broadband in  Was  Mbps in Both Directions  Years Ago  By the end of  America was to have  million households upgraded And by  the phone companies had collected about  billion from customers in excess phone charges and tax perks This includes the many companies that have merged together to now make up ATT Verizon and CenturyLink Recall that Bell telephone companies were broken up due to the monopoly and they have now all merged back together with false promises for example SBC  South Western Bell  The irony was that SBC now ATT had told the FCC that it was going to increase fiber optic broadband deployment if the merger of SBCAmeritech went through  and it was all a mirage I note that in  the current ATT claims it is going to upgrade  cities with gigapower delivering gigabit speeds  if the ATTDirect TV merger goes through Really The authors post about it on reddithttpswwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsceelihowwereispsabletopocketthebillion Book is free to readhttpswwwhuffingtonpostcomentryfreedownloadthebookofbrokenpromisesbillionusddebfbfcd if you want to see all the details Give them an any leeway and theyll take it  Starting in  there were discussions of whether the government should build these networks but the phone companies who controlled the statebased utilities in every state saw this as a new mountain of money and said  just give us a little more profit via deregulation known as alternative regulations and we will of course upgrade these networks At this time the companies wires were still monopoly controlled and the networks were closed to competition so their profits were constrained to  a year But within literally a year after the laws were changed the profits more than doubled to about  though it varied by state and phone company  By  almost every state had granted some form of alternative regulations that lifted the profit ceiling on most of the services For example Call Waiting and Call Forwarding were new services in the s It cost the company less than penny to offer Call Waiting and the other calling features cost the company pennies but they could charge  on each service  and when you throw in everything from nonpublished numbers to inside wire maintenance all of this was new found cash  The Bell companies were also able to take massive tax writeoffs From  the companies took  billion in depreciation write offs and were able to speed up the tax deductions they could take as they claimed they would be replacing the aging copper wires with fiber optics Ive read the news today oh boy Honestly politicians who take a small percentage payout to vote for something like this disgust me Ok you get k or k or whatever to help take advantage of millions upon millions of people already barely making it or struggling to get by You put millions of dollars in the pockets of people who are already rich Yet you call yourself a public servant Fuck you It is insanely frustrating how many millions people have said and written so many millions of words for so many months and even years such insane advocacy effort and awareness campaigns just to get the scumbags in government to not fuck us over Just to get them to do what we want just once And they just ignore us anyway What a fucking world Net neutrality is not even the least of our issues imagine this outpouring to prevent the loosening of regulations on banks or environmental regulations And it would have just as little impact Lawmakers seem to not be accountable AT ALL to the public Wow that Orange Red Alert at the top of my reddit page made my heart skip a beat before I read the rest and found out I wasnt about to die in nuclear war Damn yo a senator is coming to my class in college to talk about police and civilian interactions and how we can fix it gonna be weird when I drop this on her Before the repeal we were told that net neutrality was standing in the way of new products and innovations Last week Comcast announced new speeds for internet available to people with internet from Comcast but only to those who package it with cable Innovative So when I called my senator it was a secretary who seemed like he didnt really give a fuck and gave a slight chuckle like one of those bursts of air out your nose when he said hell pass it on Is there anything I can do to be seemingly more impactful Im not saying I need to be any kind of priority but the impression I got in Texas was that my comment was probably going right in the garbage Please make sure to actually call your senator rather than look at these messages and do nothing as many people will Edit Calling your senator is not the only option A comment below reccomends making messages more public as well in order to put pressure on legislators although calling is the easiest option available httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsicommentdyoknstJGYLWFCJsheb Edit  There is also Resistbot a bot that will automatically send your rep a message written by you on your behalf You can text the word RESIST to  and the bot will help you through the process though it may be a bit overloaded Donating to the bot would also help httpsresistbot Edit Because the vote is so near it may be too late to change a lot of senators minds on the issue However the vote is  in the senate and changing just one persons mind will make a big difference In addition even if this vote doesnt go our way in the near future there will be more votes in the future which you can make an impact on Edit I would also like to point out that shouting at antinet neutrality people and calling them morons as is happening below to a few nontrolly people doesnt accomplish anything Be respectful even if you disagree and remember that the downvote button is not a disagree button If they have legitimate questions counterpoints or want a discussion upvote them and reply like a decent human being would Seriously please be civil The state of washington passed thishttplawfilesextlegwagovbienniumPdfBillReportsHouseSHBRFBRpdf in march full text of billhttplawfilesextlegwagovbienniumPdfBillsSessionLawsHouseSSLpdf Remember that states have power too not just federal legislature If anyone needs a call template this is what I say Hello senator My name is name and I live in citystate and zipcode I am calling in support of title  net neutrality and would like you to vote to support net neutrality for us and future generations This is a voting issue for me and any representative voting against net neutrality will lose my vote in future elections Thank you for you time Please call your Senators Im awkward as fuck and dont even call to order pizzas most of the time but I just called my Senators and I promise you its not as scary as it seems If you absolutely cant call text RESIST to  to send a message Calling is much more impactful but this is another option And if they dont vote for net neutrality dont vote for them in November Godspeed Americans in your fight to protect net neutrality When youre done calling your Senators about this issue maybe look into electoral reformhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvstWHJfhiyolistPLNCHVwtpeBYmybPkHEnRxSObFQvFc Your elected representatives dont keep threatening to end net neutrality because they have amnesia and forget about the last time you demanded they do the right thing They want to get rid of net neutrality because theyre being paid to do it If you want to change this its going to take more than showing up at the polls and voting for the other guy because the other guy is just as likely to be beholden to the same lobbyists and party elites who tell them how to vote The only way to fix this  and so many other problems with your system of government  is to change the rules that disproportionately and unfairly prevent thirdparty candidates from having any chance at defeating the DemocraticRepublican stranglehold on power A twoparty state isnt really that much better than a oneparty state especially when both of the two parties in question serve the same wealthy elites deleted deleted The senate will decide your fate By all means call your senator But most of them are already deeply entrenched in their position on net neutrality along party lines save Susan Collins The only thing your senator will truly hear is your vote If your senators fail you remember to show up to the polls in November Change is real you just have to make politicians feel it in the ballot box Ajit has internet if you have coin Brace your self rall is about to be flooded by this is my senator posts Fuck Ajit Pai Reminder to check account lengths post histories and agendas before buying anything in this thread Lots of bots already coming out to support keeping Net Neutrality dead Dont let us down again Senate deleted Or maybe youve made the dankest of net neutralitythemed memes Let us know in the comments the fuck is happening Just gotta move somewhere like WA state that decided Net Neutrality stays here whether the feds enforce it or not I dont actually live in America but I believe the fight for net neutrality is important both as it fights off corporations trying to bend to Internet to its will to make money and because losing this fight could mean that net neutrality debates could start to spring up everywhere After all the recent bullshit going on in the world it would be nice to have a win This would at least give us a bit of hope Hopefully the Senators can have some decency Time for the th hour rally Hopefully the Senators can waste that k AtT paid out to Cohen I called my senator last time something was importnt for us guess what he said thanks and voted for the guys with the fat wallets The american political system needs to be overhauled before i believe in it again I sincerely hope that the Senate can pull through for the people God I hope Wow sorting by new gives me a headache How can people be so fucking ignorant Net Neutrality is important and if you dont think thats the case then you dont understand it Oh my God please call your senators Push past that phone anxiety and say I am doing a good thing here today Lets reverse the damage the fuckwad Mr Pai did and make things right again deleted Youll have to pardon my skepticism in any good outcome coming out of this joke of a Congress But heres hoping I guess I called my senator Marco Rubio I am a republican think what you want but I believe that the way the internet has been functioning offers a great opportunity for success and prosperity for Americans Godspeed redditors Ive been browsing rprequelmemes too much at first I thought the Senate was the one from Star Wars You know I fail to see how Ajit Pai actually thought that repealing net neutrality was a good idea I mean lets face it the main reason he did it is because hes literally nothing but a corporate mouthpiece for the big name companies that were not benefiting from The Net Neutrality Act But still Did he honestly think that repealing net neutrality would be a good idea Even before the net neutrality vote happened I was constantly telling people on social media and I think even hear that even if it were to be repealed it would probably be about as effective as the prohibition Act of the s Or insured not effective at all Some laws are just impossible to enforce And repealing net neutrality would be one of them It also was a great way to show just how little the FCC is actually required in the world I really cant believe its still undecided Incredible that something that is almost completely unanimously thought to be a bad idea by the entire country is still being debated Just incredible Welp good luck US on this Wishing you well from Europe I will not vote for anyone R or D who does not vote to restore Net Neutrality Period Ive accepted that government is never going to cater to my views because Im not a wealthy business or billionaire but at the very least us plebs deserve a protected internet No Net Neutrality support no vote from me all other issues be damned How is it this conversation keeps on coming up over and over and over What is going on that allows politicians to bring this up every few months despite initiating an uproar every single time The internet is either free or its TV May the force be with Net Neutrality Ive called my senators and representatives twice now and theyve made it clear that they dont care about public opinion on the matter Shits about to either hit the fan at the speed of light or pass right between the propellers Could you PLEASE make sure you post the appropriate Senate and House resolutions I found the House resolution HRhttpswwwcongressgovbillthcongresshouseresolution Found Senate resolution SJRhttpswwwcongressgovbillthcongresssenatejointresolutionamendments PLEASE post the name  number of the billresolution It is incredibly frustrating to want to contact my legislators but all I can say is Could you please support that billthing that the Democrats are trying to pass to rollback the FCC changes on net neutrality I would much rather say I would like you to vote for SR XYZ on net neutrality  Senate is about to vote  That means a full Senate vote is likely soon These are not the same thing Apparently they plan to win with  Dem votes  independent votes and  Rep vote Think about that the next time someone says both parties are just as bad as the other

sourcehttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewstheswitchwpthesenatespushtooverrulethefcconnetneutralitynowhasvotesdemocratssaynoredirectonutmtermffff Users here are aware that getting rid of Net Neutrality  which is meant to regulate large telecoms and their ISP activities  is a fundamental part of the GOP political platform that will never go away Win this scrap and it will surface in another form later Its crazy that this is even still something that could happen when millions of people obviously dont want it What is happening to this world  I live in NC our senators sent back lovely form letters saying I dont know what Im talking about net neutrality is killing us all They have both also taken a truckload of money to respond as such Holy hell sorting these comments by new Youd think Net Neutrality is a mass conspiracy by Reddit i finally understand why politicians keep jerking us around over NN so we dont notice how much other deregulation damage they are doing in the state dept in moneybanking environmental trade practices food drugs  healthcare energy etc its going to take a generation to repair the damage from these deplorable trumpfuks I just wish the senators and other policymakers took the time to understand the issue more than where the moneys going Its so sad that the people meant to represent us and create laws are usually dissuaded from public opinion because of lobbying and dont bother researching the issue Cant the United Nations declare internet as a free right to everyone and just get done with it As well as kids have the universal right to be educated they do have the universal right to be free to roam the web of knowledge for it belongs to everyone free of everything So has thedonald been instructed yet as to whether theyre for or against this Because last time they were quite confused  none of their hucksters told them how to feel until a few weeks before the vote I imagine this must have been very uncomfortable for those poor little chuds Ugh I love how this debate does nothing to prevent franchised monopolies How does everyone keep missing the obvious Without competition internet will always be overpriced and slow Were in the endgame now Im not really into politics nor know much about Net Neutralit I just dont get how something that is so obviously unwanted by the peoples can pass in front of everyone and get approved Take note of who votes to save Net Neutrality and who votes against it Cast your vote accordingly in November I Cannot Help As I Am Not An American But Good luck And Godspeed The senate will decide your fate Alright close your eyes and think of the absolute worst scenario Chances are that is what is going to happen Can anybody ELI why we go through this every  months or so If Net Neutrality is restored I will actually eat my Comcast router and post it to rvideos We dont need net neutrality I like the fact that the big corporations get to snuff out smaller ones that pose a threat Mom and Pop shops can burn in hell for all I care Did the above comment make you angry If so good Do something to help fix it Every little bit helps deleted The FCC I am the Senate Voters Not Yet Reminder to take action Last time a lot of us didnt call senators and just watched idly by hoping neutrality wouldnt be upturned and the result of that is this This is the last chance for all of us to fix whats going on so I urge every one of you to call your senator and demand action Ive called Rubio several times to no avail Is there anything else I can do What does the announcement say My ISP is charging me an extra month to read announcements on reddit As a UK citizen our governments may follow in your footsteps And thats a bad thing if they repeal Net Neutrality HANDS TO BATTLESTATIONS deleted Dont fuck this one up guys Heres how Bernie can still win Hey Google please call my senator and inform him that I would like Net Neutrality restored Sure thing calling your senator IF you can please call Youre Doing the rest of the world a huge favor Were rooting for ya sweden  So lets give those Senators a big Reddity hug This would involve crashing congressional servers Ajit Pai is a goof That is all Actually He is far more than just a goof but thats putting it lightly I hope only hope one day he lives to the th degree his own doings in business and in life Good riddance ONCE AND FOR ALL hopefully With that title I thought I was on rPrequelMemes oh fuck i thought i was still in Raustralia for a second and this confused me go get em ya bunch of psychopaths Both of my senators are proNN My work is done deleted How do can I help not being an American citizen Actually I live in another country but I want to help Lets hope this works reddit Do you intend to share data with httpshaveibeenpwnedcom The guy that operates that site never discloses lists of emails but only allows people to check their known email addresses against the lists he has I WANT MY MONEY BACK Were you hacked because the password for reddit was hunter Yay Im in the  year club so I have now been referred to as a very early user BTW I never received an email or message saying I my data was accessed Whats up with that TLDR If you signed up after  and dont have advertising emails from Reddit between June   youre fine Otherwise reset your password and enable FA and youll probably be fine Edit If you are affected then the hackers wont have much info on you  Signed up before May  The hackers will have your username salted and hashed passwords pretty much useless to hackers hard to crack but still change your password email address bit of a shame but  and any postsPMs you sent back then They may also have web logs which would tie an IP address with your account so people will know the general area of where youre posting from This can sometimes be linked back to specific organizationscompanies if you browse Reddit using some wifi spotscompany internet eg browsing reddit at work  Had digest emails from Reddit during early June this year This only applies for digest emails where Reddit suggests posts to you or something no clue how it works I dont use that service Password changes etc werent takenleaked so nothing was leaked if you just changed your password last month though changing it again couldnt hurt If you received advertising emails the hackers have a copy of the email Reddit sent which includes your username and some suggested posts from SFW subs youre subscribed to Worst case scenario is that someone connects a username to your reddit account via your email address  for example if your email is johndoeemailcom and your username is something silly like Jackeea then theyll have a good guess at your real name and will know which reddit account you use the horror If you desperately dont want people IRL knowing what you post on reddit delete any incriminating postshttpswwwreddithelpcomencategoriesusingreddityourredditaccountremovingyourredditdata although its unlikely that much will come of this unless you post your credit card info on your user page Hi ukeysersosa a couple of days ago I received this email It was titled with my basic password that I used on my reddit account in around  It is just so unfortunate I am aware removed is your pass word Moreover I know your secret and Ive proof of this You do not know me personally and nobody paid me to examine you Its just your hard luck that I came across your misdemeanor In fact I placed a malware on the adult vids porn material and you visited this web site to experience fun you know what I mean While you were watching video clips your web browser began functioning as a Rdp Remote control desktop with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and cam After that my software program gathered every one of your contacts from social networks and email After that I put in more time than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double screen video st part displays the recording you had been watching and second part shows the view of your web camera its you doing dirty things Honestly I am ready to forget all information about you and let you continue with your regular life And I am going to provide you two options which will achieve that These two options are either to ignore this letter or perhaps pay me  Let us examine these two options in details Option One is to

had my old reddit accounts password as the subject and again had it in the message which i will censor in the post Here you go Lets get straight to the point I know that  is your password More importantly I know your secret and Ive evidence of it You dont know me and nobody hired me to examine you It is just your misfortune that I came across your misadventures Let me tell you I setup a malware on the adult video clips porn material and you visited this site to experience fun you know what I mean While you were watching video clips your internet browser started out working as a Rdp

provider The end result was largely the same  email addresses being connected to account names publicly In other news we hired our very first Head of Security and he started  months ago Im not going to out him in this thread for obvious reason and he has been put through his paces in his first few months So far he hasnt quit On a related note if youd like to help out here and have a security background we actually have a couple of open security roles right now  Cloud Security Engineerhttpsboardsgreenhouseioredditjobs  Threat Detection Automation Engineerhttpsboardsgreenhouseioredditjobs we learned that SMSbased authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope No shit theyve been easily bypassing smsbased fa for a while now A couple of years ago there was a pretty big hubbub about it after a few big youtubers got their phones hacked Which led to a lot of their accounts being hacked because they relied on sms fa Thanks for the detailed writeup uKeyserSosa though I have a couple of questions  Does Reddit have a bug bounty program If so can you provide a link to it Its hard to Google for anything to do with Reddit because Googles algo thinks Im looking for normal Reddit content  Are there safeguards to prevent catastrophic loss Network monitors automatic shutdowns that kind of thing  When I delete something a comment or a private message say is it deleted from disk I understand it may still be in some encrypted backups but if the main application DB is breached will my deleted comments actually be gone or are they deleted with a deletedtrue type of field Thanks in advance First off thank you Reddit for being upfront about the issue Transparency in times of panic is very difficult and I feel your pain With that said can you please shed any light on how the passwords were hashed and salted Digging into the legacy codebase online I found this   alright so its not bcrypt how old is it  if the length of the stored hash is  bytes the sha hash has a salt  otherwise its sha with no salt salt   if lencomparepassword   salt  comparepassword expectedhash  passhashaname password salt if not constanttimecomparecomparepassword expectedhash return False  since we got this far its a valid password but in an old format  lets upgrade it if convertpassword apassword  bcryptpasswordpassword acommit return a  def passhashusername password salt   if salt is True salt  randstr tohash  ss s  salt username password return salt  hashlibshatohashhexdigest See httpsgithubcomredditarchiveredditblobeafbcffaebaafeferrmodelsaccountpyLLhttpsgithubcomredditarchiveredditblobeafbcffaebaafeferrmodelsaccountpyLL This implies that the hashingsalting method probably is single pass SHA and also highlights the use of a weak salt which is only  alphanumeric bytes The most concerning bit is the homegrown salting function which does not contain any form of a work factor such as PBKDF In addition it also implies that the SHA to bcrypt conversion was performed upon login rather than hash wrapping the legacy passwords Does this mean there are still SHA hashes within Reddits current production databases Can you provide clarification as to the hashing method for the breached passwords What are the chances it was the guy who was sacrificed for the soul stone To be clear accounts created since  are definitely not compromised I appreciate the honesty and the openness regarding serious security breaches like this I hope that more companies take after your protocol of informing their audiencebase about these kinds of security breaches since they do happen and are better resolved when the consumers of your platform are minutely aware of the exact level of detail and nuance that the breach entails Thanks KeyserSosa June  Why are you only notifying now Isnt that a breach of GDPR breach disclosure rules which state that it must be done within  hours of finding such breach Disclaimer IANAL but I had my share with GDPR Interesting comments around GDPR happening in here my  cents  First GDPR applies to any company worldwide as soon as they process personal information of European citizens  Any company not having offices in the EU like reddit and their owners can LOL about it AFAIK there is no treaty in place to enforce any fines or legal actions outside of the EU  But its still a serious issue At least on paper it has strict enforcements for real life scenarios the next years will show how they will be actually handled In the reddit case b is valid but due to personal accountability under GDPR for upper management CLevels Directors  they still could get into trouble Probably not for a minor issue like the current event but for serious incidents upper management could be detained as soon as they enter EU soil Eg travelling to Europe for a vacation or conference Since June thhttpsiimgurcomqcnqBpng my brothers steam account has been getting constant login attempts Its also the only two sites which share the same username Ive since gotten them to change the password Could this have been the cause Doesnt GDPR require you to report an incident exactly when it occurs Or as soon as you possibly can so that people have time to chamge passwords and react Transparency action taken and quick disclosure I dont think anyone can expect more If you think the internet is perfectly safe and any website is beyond security problems you live in a fantasy world Web security is an arms race and neither side ever wins I think Reddit did a good job with this A week or two ago my oldest account was suspendedhttpsiimgurcomKCsReGjpg because of suspicious activity Is this related to the incident Why is a  database backup on public servers Its also worth listing out the facts   SHA hash was used insecure sourcehttpsoldredditcomrannouncementscommentsqnmwehadasecurityincidenthereswhatyouneedtoefpb   salts were also leaked really insecure now sourcehttpsoldredditcomrnetseccommentsraereddithadasecurityincidenthereswhatyouefedmk   usernames saltedhashed passwords emails all content including private messages   Reddit source code   internal logs   configuration files   other employee workspace files Quick question arent you forced by the GDPR to announce those  days after finding them and doesnt that violate the GDPR deleted Thank you Reddit for letting us know about the breach I hope you hold your security to an even higher standard as one of the largest websites on the internet  Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication FA we learned that SMSbased authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope and the main attack was via SMS intercept We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to tokenbased FA So when can I expect UF support for my reddit account deleted Why did it take you this long to publicly announce the incident GDPR requires disclosure within  hours Edit where is your GDPR compliance officer contact information I am just wondering how sophisticated these hackers were To find multiple Reddit employees and their logins and their phone numbers and intercept their sms messages is not a small task I really appreciate the detailed account of what happened knowing how the attack occurred will help raise awareness and aid other businesses in protecting both themselves and their clients in the future Thank you for hashing Its really the least anyone could do but hey Yahoo got hacked with plaintext passwords associated with users then got hacked again with plaintext passwords stored alongside users and I think email addresses Honestly as a security wake up call you got off pretty light and already have new resources spinning up to become a more secure enterprise Thanks for the detailed report This makes me wonder whether associating an email address with a reddit account is an acceptable risk Is there a way to disassociate an email address reverting to no verified email What would be the disadvantages of that Thank you for the information Cant ask for more than all the transparency and quick action taken Not changing your password in  years sounds insane to me That explains the email I got Some rando emailed me with an old password I havent used in years in the subject line and gave this whole story about how hed hacked into my system and I needed to pay k in bitcoin so he wouldnt send videos of me masturbating to everyone on my contact list I knew it was bullshit but this at least explains where he got that password from EDIT We have since decided that my email was separate from whatever happened in the OP  a  database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords You had a  database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords I dont think Ive ever considered Reddit to be that secure like Facebook and the rest Id never put anything in PMs or private subs I wanted keeping secret I suspect most other users here are the same as long as you stick to unique passwords and FA then that should be enough Thanks for the transparency F Thanks for the disclosure more companies should do this ie prompt disclosure not get hacked Any reason that Reddit didnt notify within the  hours required for handlers of EU data Or did you indeed notify everyone involved within that time period httpsgdprinfoeuartgdpr  On June  we learned that between June  and June  an attacker compromised a few of our employees accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers So why are we only finding out about this now on August  Although this was a serious attack the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems they gained readonly access to some systems that contained backup data source code and other logs Shame they might have deleted New Reddit In the clear on both areas but still appreciate the transparency with this post Thank you for all you do Reddit admins Are my  imaginary internet points safe I havent seen this answered elsewhere yet but how did you detect the attacker Will there be a more detailed technical writeup available in the future Thanks for handling this so responsibly Why do you have a complete copy of a database that old Im realizing that I honestly dont know how anything works on Reddit  years later deleted THE KARMA ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO CRASH FOLKS SELL SELL SELL TLDR K deleted Will the real scores of posts still be hidden That is reloading the page gives you a score that is within a certain range of votes of the actual score instead of the actual score For example theres a post on the front page and the score is  upvotes but when I go to the comments it now says the score is  If I have a post that has a score of  I might keep refereshing the page to find it has     etc Will real scores still be shown or will real scores be shown with a certain offset That started working really fast So Obamas AMA actually got k up votes This is working in reverse too right There are some posts with   k that have only been up for mere hours What effect will this have on front page posts Would it take longer for news to reach the front page or no Will this affect how much link karma well get from posts Will this have any effect on comment scores okay Im ready lets go the Obama AMA is below k

put the actual number that represents upvotes  downvotes Who are we punishing now So long as the people from conspiracy feel like theyre getting screwed Im good with this The beast in the picture

for top listings to recompute to reflect the change UmmhttpiimgurcomyzNQEWpng ELI why did the top posts almost always stop growing at around  upvotes before this update And after this change the top posts have around k upvotes why was the k displayed as k before I dislike this new system Why not just put the full number  is only one character longer then k and its a more accurate number edit actually reddit doesnt even use the comma for the score So its the same size until it reaches k  is the same character length as k edit  if you hover over the number it will show you the full number What does the K on highscoring posts stand for Is this just posts Or comments too Goddammit the vote manipulation from rthedonald just became super apparent Sort by tophour every post is from that sub

like to pop in and take a look credit to urobbit for his writeup D I strongly recommend checking out the Julia Reda AMAhttpswwwredditcomreuropecommentsoywxziammepjuliaredafightingtosaveyourinternet  it was excellent I love how Spain did this thing almost  years ago all of the online news agencies lost traffic So why not the whole EU this time Cant go bad twice right This is really not good Will this affect us at different countries To be honest Im wondering how they could have thought this was a good idea in the first place what with the glaring faults in it and all Links to news articles being potentially banned Images being scanned and censored Its basically an end to information sharing and memes in EU I have written the following to my districts MEPs Dear Margot Parker Jonathan Bullock Rory Palmer Rupert Matthews and Emma McClarkin My name is me and I am writing to you today to indicate my strong opposition to Article  the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links and Article  the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content The proposal of a link tax in article  creates an untenable restriction on how users share and aggregate information This change would be to the detriment of millions of users across hundreds of thousands of websites all across the EU Shared links are a source of information education and entertainment that simply cannot be altered The age of information has greatly increased the publics awareness of many issues the world over which they previously wouldnt have ever been able to know and to attempt to change how this information spreads is nothing more than censorship The proposed article  would install automatic upload filters to scan and potentially censor every single piece of content for potential copyright infringements Im a firm believer in copyright but an automatic system with no discretion cannot possibly be relied upon to identify the nuances involved in copyright law particularly around the reasonable defence of fair use I have known many content creators to have their content removed for unjust claims of copyright infringement and in the case of YouTube erroneous DMCA claims due to both faulty algorithmic detection and false claims in order to censor The proposed measures are a way to shut down the free and open internet plain and simple These issues are not partisan Noone but greedy corporations stand to gain anything from the proposed changes Spain introduced similar intellectual property laws which independent studies have shown had been a financial disaster for publishers even so far as to encourage Google to no longer publish news links in the country Consumers experience a much smaller variety of content and the law impedes the ability of innovation to enter the market You can search for Spains Google tax if you are unfamiliar with the above Please do not allow these valuable resources to be altered beyond our recognition Please do not allow free speech to be trampled If you are an advocate for your constituents and you hold the values of the common man please do not allow these measures to pass Thank you for taking the time to read this letter Yours sincerely Me again I will share any responses I receive I wrote to them using the website WriteToThemcom Edit  I have received the following reply from Rupert Matthews MEP Dear me Thank you for your letter I appreciate your concerns regarding the new Copyright reform proposals However the objective of Article  is to make sure authors such as musicians are appropriately paid for their work and to ensure that platforms fairly share revenues which they derive from creative works on their sites with creators In the text under discussion if one of the main purposes of a platform is to share copyright works if they optimise these works and also derive profit from them the platform would need to conclude a fair license with the rightholders if rightholders request this If not platforms will have to check for and remove specific copyright content once this is supplied from rightholders This could include pirated films which are on platforms at the same time as they are shown at the cinema However if a platforms main purpose is not to share protected works it does not optimise copyright works nor to make profit from them it would not be required to conclude a license Closing this value gap is an essential part of the Copyright Directive which Secretary of State Matthew Hancock supports addressing httpswwwgovukgovernmentspeechesmatthancocksspeechattheallianceforintellectualpropertyreception  The ECR supports the general policy justification behind it which is to make sure that platforms are responsible for their sites and that authors are fairly rewarded and incentivised to create work Content recognition will help to make sure creators such as song writers can be better identified and paid fairly for their work Nevertheless this should not be done at the expense of users rights We are dedicated to striking the right balance between adequately rewarding rightholders and safeguarding users rights There are therefore important safeguards to protect users rights and to make sure only proportionate measures are taken As regards to Article  and the link tax this remains under discussion The objective is to enable the publishing industry and journalists to be given their fair share of revenue However as currently drafted it is too far reaching for the ECR to be able to lend its support to it Kind regards Rupert Rupert Matthews Member of the European Parliament East Midlands Region Edit  Comparing the response I received to the one received by umidget it seems that this response is a prefabricated autoresponse to anyone against this issue Im quite upset that our individual concerns arent even being addressed by those who are meant to represent us Link tax Thats the dumbest tax law Ive ever heard of I dont think news sites would gain much from this too I get why they wanna copyright but wouldnt making it legally nessecary to provide source and link to article if there is one much better News gain popularity by discussion not views I think this is a bad idea for both the media and the users Article  would create a link tax Links that share short snippets of news articles even just the headline could become subject to copyright licensing fees pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit I feel like this is more of an information tax than a licensing fee You want news Well now you have to pay a tax on the mere link The kills any kind of board where you share any kind of links which is basically the entire internet I wont even get started on the second article because its silly enough through plainwords This is a way to control and shut down the internet plain and simple I dont see how any website except maybe Google or other extremely large corporations could afford to host any kind of news aggregation Even they would likely say screw it due to the ridiculous cost What I would like to know is who is behind this Who do we need to name and shame on trying to kill the internet So how would somebody in the US help out This will still affect everyone outside the EU Companies like Reddit may have to simply stop doing business in the EU entirely with these laws which will kill a huge portion of their revenue possibly requiring staff layoffs even outside of the EU and damaging the service as a whole for all users It will also kill alternative media outlets Only massive media corporations run by a tiny number of very wealthly individuals will be capable of operating Same goes for alternative social media websites Interesting I wander why they are doing that That will make it difficult to get the news to younger people who dont watch much TV Hmmm  Maybe they are losing rating and need to bring people back to local news Nonetheless it is a awful and hope it dont go through Related to Europe are there any plans to make reddit fully GDPR compliant Such as with the registration process  reddit makes it so you consent to the privacy  content policy by default when signing up this is not compliant We also dont have comprehensive user access to our data Thishttpswwwreddithelpcomencategoriesusingreddityourredditaccountaccessingyourredditdata is not comprehensive if you are an active poster with over  comments or submissions You cannot access any items past the  mark through your profile Edit if anyone knows more or can correct me on something Im happy to hear it as this isnt my field of workstudy just my casual understanding Reddit seems notably deficient in compliance compared to other major websites We must oppose all government attempts to control our access to the internet Thank you so much for sharing this I was actually planning on posting a thread over at rtechnology about this with help of some other moderators I had got in touch with over a few other subreddits Heres the original thread I was planning on posting if anyones interested The Copyright Directive is a proposal currently making its way through the EU that will massively reform how copyright law is written for the digital age It will impose widespread censorship of all the content you see and share online This includes everything from parodies reviews critiques and even memes The proposal states that companies like Facebook Instagram YouTube and other big social media sites including Reddit must have automated systems that filter and remove content that use copyright material If youre aware of the state YouTubes systems are in you know how successful these systems may be and so any attempt at creating systems that recognise a meme from a genuine copyright infringement is outright impossible This also threatens things like blogging gaming livestreams song remixes code sharing discussion platforms and countless other areas of the internet we so love dearly  Online platforms will be required to implement complex and expensive filtering systems and will be held liable for copyright infringement potentially incurring fines that threaten their economic viability This will affect everyone on the internet  consumer or creator EU citizen or not We must fight against this This is censorship of the masses for the benefit of the corporates We cannot allow them to take away our right to share content used for entertainment parodying criticism or else What can you do to help Contact your MEP and voice your concerns against this proposal SaveYourInterneteuhttpssaveyourinterneteu provides easy instructions on how to email

understanding the legalese and there is a subtle hidden meaning that can be extrapolated Could someone break down for me exactly how Article  creates this supposed link tax If whoever originally wrote it intended for a link tax I can understand why anyone reading it and voting on it would not get that impression For reference the full text of Article  apologies if this is poorly formatted Im on mobile Article  Protection of press publications concerning digital uses  Member States shall provide publishers of press publications with the rights provided for in Article  and Article  of Directive EC for the digital use of their press publications  The rights referred to in paragraph  shall leave intact and shall in no way affect any rights provided for in Union law to authors and other rightholders in respect of the works and other subjectmatter incorporated in a press publication Such rights may not be invoked against those authors and other rightholders and in particular may not deprive them of their right to exploit their works and other subjectmatter independently from the press publication in which they are incorporated  Articles  to  of Directive EC and Directive EU shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of the rights referred to in paragraph   The rights referred to in paragraph  shall expire  years after the publication of the press publication This term shall be calculated from the first day of January of the year following the date of publication Seriously big copyright owners MPAA and RIAA and ISPs are trying to shred the internet to pieces all over the

the Schengen zone like Norway do about all this We might be within the greater European economical area but we dont actually have a representative within the European Parliament and before someone asks Im not lying about my location Thats how you get people not taking you seriously Guys reading the actual proposal itself can anybody explain to me word by word how to get to the same conclusion that the MEP pulled I really wanna understand it more than just a small summary All Im getting out of article  is that itll prevent misleading new titles by preventing too much alterations and out of article  is improvements on copyright technologies and holders transparency and rights I dont get it Source httpseurlexeuropaeulegalcontentENTXTPDFuriCELEXPCfromEN  We care deeply about protecting the

internet on a fucked network and then some other silly fuckwit is tryna fuckin shit in me shoes with their bullshit about what I can and cant look at The phrase your MEP doesnt really make sense in Europe We have a more proportional system for the European Parliament with districts the size of countries meaning every country is represented by a group of MEPs depending on the size of its population I guess the most sensible thing to do would be to call the MEP you voted for in the past if you voted Otherwise perhaps call the MEP who is the spokesperson on copyright law within the party that comes close to your political preference This may mean your MEP is not from your country Why the hell did you wait so long to make a post about this The vote is in a week Article  gets less attention but needs changes too In its current form it denies anyone who isnt an accredited research lab to do text mining This means that right is denied to citizen scientists and AI firms for example which will take a huge shit on European research that doesnt take place in a university or has any vaguely commercial intent I still think the internet as it is now will cease to exist Governments seem keen to censor it and with good reason Its very powerful and they will judge if its too powerful for the population Remember that when EU or the USA finally censor the internet other countries will soon follow I dont quite see the problem with Article  It explicitly says The rights referred to in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of uses of insubstantial parts of a press publication which is equivalent to the citation exception weve had forever in Denmark Reading the law proposal I dont see how anyone gets link tax out of it Article  on the other hand is immediately awful It does have some escape hatches in paragraph  but hard to determine if something would be permitted under those Mozilla has a tool to directly connect you to one MEP and they also provide a little script you can read to them httpschangecopyrightorghttpschangecopyrightorg How will this impact switzerland They are not part of the EU but have bilateral contracts with the EU Why politicians always want to fuck up our rights It seems like an invincible battle anytime we achieve a victory there is ready another awful law to vote to fuck us for good I hate this For those wondering why Do not be generous in your assessment These guys know EXACTLY what they want from this They are not ignorant their intent is to wreck the internet as you know it in order to create an industry that can make money off sanitizing information before it reaches the internet Pretty much they want money to be editors or go back to how things used to be when informational exchanges were very limited and expensive Newspapers Radio and TV can only exchange so much information What you really paid papers for was their editorial work to limit information only to what was needed to draw eyeballs to ads They want that world again Their INTENT is to destroy the internet They dont want people to research specific topics and find stories on it They want people to have to research their paperwebsite in order to find what stories are need to know for the day Ergo exactly how things used to work before we took a step toward becoming a postinformationscarcity society Instead going to FacebookTwitterRedditGoogle and seeing a bunch of papers competing to inform you like an information marketplace where they are a single shop They want to you to go to their website and for them to be the marketplaceand all the items on sale Are all made by them Thats how it used to be This is supported by the government because it creates a great exploitable relationship for people to get rich over and for the few to control information And its done without the need criminal punitive measures Which can look tyrannical it will be done through civil punishments from private parties But the effect will be the same Limiting information sharing Those civil punishments will make it so information will be too expensive to simply toss around So once more the editorial work of news papers will be in demand deciding what readers get to look at for the same reasoning as in times past because there will only be a limited amount of space for it because only a few trustworthy news media giants Wink wink nudge nudge will have relationships with various media trademark and copyright watchdogs to ensure they arent sued to oblivion So only these media giants will be able to handle publishing informationyou want your information out there it needs to be approved by their editorial process This is very different from the hosting model a lot of the information exchanges online currently adhere tohosting has very very limited editorial control In theory but growing censorship in these spaces is another discussion However this limitation is artificial rather than practical Like the physical limitation of bandwidth on radioTV or the limitation on spacelogistics in news papers and thus the government is needed by the papers to create itso the papers are indebted to the governments The governments now have a few specific nexuses online where information gets printed who are in their debt and partly under their thumbwhich works well to limit bad information Or any information which is damaging Everyone wins except you This is not a blunder being done by ignorant people This is a calculated move being done by people looking to resurrect an industry for the dual purpose of having better control over information and being able to make more money of said control South American here wishing you all luck Especially because our Governments over here might like and try to copy this idea if it gets through deleted Would be nice if RedditConde Nast stopped trying to promote their own corporate interests as Free and Open Internet deleted Im from the Netherlands and would like to contact my MEP Ive looked online and saw that the Netherlands has  MEPs how do I know which one to call I live in Amsterdam in specific When can the world finally be done with policing and spying on their people Because believe me this legislation has nothing to do with copyright holders wanting a share of the revenue and everything to do with countries fearing the amount of free thought and freedom of expression that the internet affords its users and slowly trying to put a permanent end to that Never forget this During moments like these Im pretty happy I live in Canada Were not perfect but our government is pretty sensible with net neutrality and actually made laws to prevent it from happening like in the states The Canadian Consumer Agency responds so quickly to complaints about telecompanies who may even do this sketchy stuff We didnt do it Reddit  This stuff sounds like something legislators that dont actually understand the internet came up with Good luck Euros Im sure some crap like this is coming to the states soon I emailed our UK south west MEP this morning to raise my concerns  he replied with Thank you for your email I appreciate your concerns regarding the new Copyright reform proposals The main objective of this proposal is to make sure authors such as musicians are appropriately paid for their work and to ensure that platforms fairly share revenues which they derive from creative works on their sites with creators In the current text under discussion if one of the main purposes of a platform is to share and optimise copyright work if they also derive profit from them and if they optimise the content the platform would need to conclude a license with the rightholders if rightholders request this If not platforms will have monitor specific copyright content once this is supplied from rightholders However if a platforms main purpose is not to share protected works and does not optimise copyright works nor to make profit from them there would be no need for a licence Closing this value gap is an essential part of the proposal which Secretary of State Matthew Hancock supports addressing httpswwwgovukgovernmentspeechesmatthancocksspeechattheallianceforintellectualpropertyreception  The ECR supports the general policy justification behind it which is to make sure that authors are fairly rewarded and incentivised to create work Nevertheless I agree this should not be done at the expense of SMEs startup companies and individual rights This is why the we are dedicated to striking the right balance between adequately rewarding rightholders and providing the flexibility necessary to see the industry flourish with innovation There are therefore important safeguards to protect users rights and to make sure only proportionate measures are taken Article  is still being negotiated and no final agreement has been reached So at this stage can I assure you that I take your concerns on board and will pass them on to my colleagues who are working on this document Its a shame that the FCC is ignoring the opinions of everyone the same way admins are ignoring how everyone hates the reddit redesign Easy solution Ban all European IP addresses and provide the little pop up like cookies have everywhere now asking people to identify that they are not from Europe and that this is an illegal site if they are Problem solved When they stop writing laws like a rd world autocracy we can open it up for them again So US persons should fight to get the state regulating the internet And then on the European side we need to fight scary censorship regulations the state is trying to use to control the internetokie dokie Also I keep seeing memes that the EU is trying to ban memesus thus truerelated Shit They voted yes Update for everyone Article  and  was NOT passed Thanks for everyone that opposed this and called their MEP to secure this win for internet freedom  I really hope you guys over there dont duck up things like we have in America so far May that online freedom stand deleted Politicians putting forward legislation which is entirely out of touch with common people at the behest of large interest groups Its about as universal a human phenomena as you can get Anyone has even glanced at Reddit TCs method of usurping the copyright on uploaded images knows this post to be complete hypocrisy Let Reddit do its own dirty work why should they get paid instead of creators Censorship would destroy the free market experiment that is the internet Words matter Cant wait for the UKs internet license Even if Net Neutrality was repealed in the US we still have to fight for our friends overseas Everyone no matter where they live should be able to enjoy a free and open internet Hows Tommy Robinson doing and his freedom of speech deleted If and when this is implemented Id love to see Twitter users sue the arse off the tabloids Virtually every story they run seems to have quotes from twitter users the sun even ran a whole story based on an inane thread on Mumsnet last week We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet and we know Redditors do too You people give the impression of only caring for the freedom of those who write and think like you do Automods roll out Do you have a link to the text of the actual regulation being voted on not the BBC rehash Because I seem to have seen it somewhere and it has no direct mention of link tax and filters Ironic people who dont like Reddit are here reading Reddit and have an account commenting on it Man Some people just dont know they have it good until its taken away from them I dont really understand if it affects Switzerland or not but I want to help where I can It makes me so sad to see companies and money chosen over the people and their freedom by politics I seriously hope these laws wont pass but I have little faith Wait what the hell is with Article  How will news sites make money if no one bothers to link to them Surely that law will destroy online news sites Is their a list of each countrys MEPs name Regarding this matter Id like to email them as wel about this as I can word my comments better via mail It just wont happen EU is not as stupid as the USA You guys have to do this because we fucked it up in America  honestly this seems  times worse than that Net Neutrality Debacle a while back rcasualUK is having a big laugh right now What if the EU Copyright Directive does pass Will Reddit just shut down in Europe or ruin the experience for everyone I as an American am very scared The internet is being destroyed by TPTB for the sake of profit before my very eyes We should be taking up arms in rebellion against these people yet we are all cowards America needs to undo Icann Obama had no god damn right giving away the keys to the internet Thats step  Step  we put the EU on a day timeout A blackout from the internet Obama decides to share the internet with the world  years later the EU is trying to impose speech laws on the rest of the world Go fk yourselves When brexit isnt looking as bad rn Brexit not lookin so dumb now  years ago there was already an attempt to pass a similar legislation as many know  it was called ACTA and ended up being thrown out due to mass street protests httpcopybuzzcomcopyrighttimetoactaonarticlehttpcopybuzzcomcopyrighttimetoactaonarticle The lobbyists etc aimed to pass it quietly out of public sight  they already considered it a done deal when the people caught up with what was happening and the whole thing ended up being discarded This time it looks like the EU has a stronger motivation to pass it  especially given how journalists are to be included under these new copyright protections its likely that one of the things theyre interested in is to nerf criticisms of establishment media and beat back the currently brewing Euroskeptic sentiments However on the other hand theres a subset of EU members that dont like the way things are going with this proposal  apparently even less than they liked ACTA httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxwRcTgrwhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxwRcTgrw httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvYinyEePIchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvYinyEePIc Looks like theres some serious corruption going on up there  members are being pressured into voting in favor of Articles  and even threatened with losing their positions if they dont As shown in those clips EU Today relayed a report from an EU member that wished to stay anonymous concerning the threats and pressuring  next day the article disappears and is later replaced with a new version more supportive of the proposed legislations Did the EU or cooperating organizations pressure EU Today into changing their tune According to that source pressuring members to vote in that direction is going too far So it would seem like some of the EU members dislike this proposal and the way its being handled and would be especially inclined to vote against it if the EU lost its ability to fire or demote them for voting the wrong way and get away with it And thats exactly why public exposure to this issue both the vote and the creepy corrupt tactics that are going on up therehere is so important  it already worked last time it would empower the pressured members and disempower the corrupt elements from pulling shady tactics of this kind Telling people to call the MEPs is essential but making sure a really overwhelming large percentage of the public learns about this whole thing is really the key here Then theyll make even more calls take it to the streets and the EUs illegitimate corrupt tactics will be talked and written about in every corner of the internet and irl  probably increasing public vigilance in the longer run as well  Both the government and private companies can censor stuff But private companies are a little bit scarier They have no constitution to answer to Theyre not elected They have no constituents or voters All of the protections weve built up to protect against government tyranny dont exist for corporate tyranny   Is the internet going to stay free Are private companies going to censor the websites I visit or charge more to visit certain websites Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites And when I visit these websites are they going to constrain what I can say to only let me say certain types of things or steer me to certain types of pages All of those are battles that weve won so far and weve been very lucky to win them But we could quite easily lose so we need to stay vigilant    Aaron Swartz cofounder of Reddit Between this and the fines for GDPR the web is going to splitter pretty badly Dont get me wrong the personal data thing is the right thing to do GDPR but the consequences nearly all us media locking out Europe arent good Hi uarabscarab You are against article  but Reddit is full of subreddits that violate copyright by posting full versions of newspaper articles to get around paywalls There are even accounts that exist just to repost articles so news outlets dont get any advertising revenue from clicks And theres no way to report this unless the reporter is the copyright holder And if it is reported to the a subreddits mods there is no way to ensure they remove the content Is it reddits position that these news outlets shouldnt be paid for their work And if so why If not what is reddit doing to support the journalistic outlets that lets face it provide a massive amount of content for Reddit deleted Very interesting net neutrality died in the US yesterday and there were very few posts but European proposed laws would threaten reddits income and suddenly there is an admin announcement about it Very interesting its almost like reddit admins want money and dont care about us You say freedom is important yet you censor subreddit edit user posts and adjust your site against subreddit with new rules explicitly for those subreddits Reddit fighting for internet freedom on every front I like it What is the rationale behind putting fees on articles posted elsewhere isnt it giving those sites increased ad revenue anyway Great stuff I will seriously jump off a cliff if I have to pay for clicking a link Why is Reddit pushing free and open internet when they censor political opinions they dont like Reddit is and was already censoring content prior to this laws Just look at what mods choose suitable for worldnews This is just limiting their power not censorship in general I think its cool that you help the users rise up against finantial and political interests trying to destroy the internet I just wish you didnt only do it when its dangerous for your business model and tried to do something about astroturfing and steer away from native advertisement on reddit and collection of user data I also dont like the redesign free and open internet reddit rrrrrrrright This is fucking discusting the internet is the only place we can go on and say shit anonymously every other aspect of our lives is controlled by tbe government and now they want to control the internet Does the uk still count as eu Man when is Reddit admin gonna stop with the free expression bullshit This site has hundreds of heavily censored propaganda platforms including dozens set up for the sole purpose of harassing individuals or witch hunt subsites for harassing individual Redditors In practice application of European law tends to be centered around the big players and abusers of law not the people Same as with the GDPR its not going to be used to hammer down every single company on day one I predict that this legislation serves to tackle sites that downright copy content for their own gain Since reddit by its nature promotes other content platforms I highly doubt its going to get negatively impacted by this This is the only time in my life Ive been somewhat thankful for Brexit Haha member that time u said brexit was a shit idea Old people ruin things they dont understand more at  Sending my best wishes to Europe on their battle for net neutrality Its a shame something like this even has to be fought for The only reason reddit opposes article  is because it requires more resources The article doesnt state that you must catch all IP infringing posts just that the implementation has to be effective It also states that the service providers must make it easy to file an IP claim All you need to do is to have IP owners provide a sample of the infringed IP validate said IP and the compare it with new posts This means that reddit has to hire a couple of people to validate IP claims and spend a considerable amount of processing on comparison Which in turn results in a less profitable business Article  on the other hand must die Yay another edition of Reddit my government varying countries is terrible and its leader is a tyrant Also Reddit please government control my internet access Art  making memes illegal boys we cant have that This is what happens when techilliterate old people are in power to make laws that govern technology What about net neutrality that just ended in the US What makes it easier for us Europeans is that there arent big companies lobbying and trying to affect the vote because frankly it wont help anyone Also if the law passes it will most likely be reverted soon after I wrote to all Swedish members of the EU parliament about two weeks ago and only ONE  of total  persons has bothered to reply to me and saying yes he agrees that these articles are bad and that he will vote against it I wonder what the others are going to do and why they are so quite about this issue no thanks Thats just fantastic How likely is this to pass Its time we make a new internet we cant just stand around while corrupt politicians ruin our beautiful wonderland The internet was built for the users and just because it has been more and more accessible to the public doesnt mean it should be anything different then when it started Or we could just rebel the EU but what do I know we must form a group to fight for internet freedom Otherwise they will censor the internet step by step Important Also message your big newspapers that did not write about this matter as of yet Thats what I did I also called a few MEPs so I already had some useful information about their opinions to share with the newspapers beforehand For those who want to understandchange this situation httpsjuliaredaeuenhttpsjuliaredaeuen This link contains a simple and easy to read summary on the laws in question highly recommend reading httpssaveyourinterneteu This link lets you write to or call the people representing your country httpsactopenmediaorgsavethelinkcall httpschangecopyrightorgenUS These links provide help to call the MEPs in your country yup i knew it if it happened in america it will happen here too no matter how loudly frau merkel is against it theyre all a bunch of hypocrites and no theres nothing we can do you tried americans didnt you  and they succeeded sooner or later its gonna happen The real question is why anyone thinks this is a good idea What would be the result of this Do they think most sites can implement  Most will just shut their doors to the EU Which BTW you should do ala SOPA protest And  would grind even sites that include content to a halt Because how could you link to other sites How could you share things I think the main thing that should be done is for sites around the world to do a SOPA thing and show what the Internet will be like if this passes as is The burden is obviously so high that no site could actually comply So no more Internet for the EU Wow this is the first Im hearing about this and I hope that the people of the EU are successful and at fighting this If this does pass it will just strengthen the need and investment into alternative methods of getting onto the internet TOR Mozilla is working on integrating TOR into FirefoxhttpstractorprojectorgprojectstorwikiorgmeetingsRomeNotesFusionProject hacker

internet needs to remain free for fall no matter where you are Im  behind this I stole the template of this and most of the content and substance and idea from uScottyMcBones Please dont hate me This is the letter I wrote through writetothemcom to my MEPs Dear Ashley Fox Julia Reid Julie Girling Molly Scott Cato Clare Moody and William The Earl of Dartmouth My name is Me and I am writing to you today to indicate my strong opposition to Article  the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links and Article  the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content The proposal of a link tax in article  would create an unprecedented restriction on how we all share and learn information This link tax would be to the detriment of users across countless websites all throughout the EU Shared links work successfully as free advertising for many news websites directing users onto the original platform and helping them gain views and readers that they otherwise would not have access to as well as being huge source of information education and entertainment for so many that simply must not be altered The information age has greatly increased the publics awareness of many issues around the world which they previously wouldnt have ever been able to know and to attempt to change how this information spreads is nothing less than censorship The proposed article  would install automatic upload filters to scan and potentially censor every single piece of content for potential copyright infringements Im a firm believer in copyright for the protection of individual creators and artists but an automatic system with no discretion cannot possibly be relied upon to identify the nuances involved in copyright law particularly around the reasonable defence of fair use As such this will just be manipulated either purposefully or not to punish individual aritists by large corporations I have known many content creators who have had their content removed for unjust claims of copyright infringement and erroneous DMCA claims due to both faulty algorithmic detection and false claims in order to censor especially in the website that I use as my primary source of both income and entertainment as do many of these European creators The proposed measures are a way to shut down the free and open internet plain and simple These are not partisan issues No one but greedy corporations stand to gain anything from the proposed changes at the expense of numerous European artists and the European public at large Spain infamously introduced similar intellectual property laws which were found by independent studies to have been a financial disaster for publishers even so far as to encourage Google to no longer publish news links in the country Consumers experience a much smaller variety of content and the law impedes the ability of innovation to enter the market I would encourage you to research Spains Google tax if you are unfamiliar with the above and would like more information on the effects of this historic proposal I understand that as things stand the UK is on its way out of the EU however while we remain a member please ensure that you stand with your constituents and the rest of the European people on this monumental issue Please do not allow these valuable resources to be altered beyond our recognition Please do not allow free speech to be trampled If you are an advocate for your constituents and you hold the values of the common man please do not allow these measures to pass Thank you for taking the time to read this letter Yours sincerely Me I have since received this reply from Ashley Fox Conservative MEP for South West England and Gibraltar Dear Midget Thank you for your email I appreciate your concerns

proposalhttpwwweuroparleuropaeusidesgetDocdopubRefffEPffTEXTbREPORTbAbbDOCbXMLbVffENlanguageEN lead by Axel Voss MEP was rejected with  voted for the proposal and  voted against it What does t his mean This is not the end this does not mean that the Copyright Directive is off the table The vote today was not about deleting Art  and  Its about having a full plenary debate and allowing amendments to improve those articles Now the file will be debated in the Parliament and open for amendments There are alternatives written by EPP members on the table that would still protect authors but without collateral damage to the open internet article httpsjuliaredaeuwpcontentuploadsredacompromisepdf article httpsjuliaredaeuwpcontentuploadsredacompromisepdf There is also room for improvement in many other articles that would benefit libraries museum and schools Here is an overview by EBLIDAhttpwwweblidaorgNewsEBLIDArecapofJURIDSMvoteofjuneFINALpdf European Bureau of Library Information and Documentation Associations that might be useful for some to understand the scope of many of the amendments What will happen next Now extreme lobbying will begin in the EP What we need to be careful of is that some of the amendments of the JURI committee were actually quite good  when it comes to the public domain preservation exception educational exceptions out of commerce work etc Getting those amendments into the state where we are now has been a lot of work and even though there is always room for improvement then there is also room for good work to be undone The focus needs to be on article  the press publishers right and on article  the filter and also in my opinion on article  text and data mining and article  Common provisions This was merely one vote of many the next vote will decide upon the Parliaments negotiating position in the Trilogues between the Commission the Council and the Parliament When the trilogues are done the decision is ratified by the Parliament and then within couple of years adopted into national law of your member states Might be a bit premature for celebration Back to the drawing board not permanently scrapped Theyll keep trying and we need to remain vigilant Also I legitimately thought this post was about banning half of rthanosdidnothingwrong Remember everyone voting matters unlike your opinions of the redesign Not to be a party pooper but Ive seen a lot of reference to memes and memes only through this escapade and in the eyes of any involved in passing this it might make our argument seem childish and immature when theres so much more at stake Reddit for example I know the majority are being lighthearted but Ive seen a few people focused on saving the memes and the memes only Reddit didnt accomplish this Certainly not alone FROM THIS DAY ON THE TH OF JULY SHALL BE KNOWN AS MEME DAY ITS MEME DAY MY DUDES deleted Whats this gold thing everyones getting for low effort comments Seems to be a lot of confusion on what has happened so Ill try and explain The copyright directive was proposed by the European Commission The commission is the only EU institution that can initiate proposals for new law The directive went to the Council of  Member States This is where national governments are represented So  civil servants negotiated behind closed doors until they agreed on amendments to the proposal and it was approved by  ministers from national governments It also went to the European Parliament at the same time as the Council The European Parliament assigned it to the legal affairs committee where the meps debated and discussed it and voted on a final text that passed through committee Crucially the legal affairs committee gave the European Parliaments negotiators the mandate to begin negotiations with the Council Only the Council and Parliament can approve bills to become laws so they must negotiate with each other to get a joint text At the start of the plenary session of the European Parliament when the whole house sits together to debate the intention to begin negotiations was announced as is mandated in the European Parliament rules of procedure At this time a number of MEPs requested a vote of the full house on whether negotiations with the Council could begin this doesnt always happen That vote then took place and the majority ruled that negotiations could not begin again So now a minimum number cant remember how many of MEPs can amend the Parliament text Can someone explain whats going on rfellowkids Oof what a bad take on this whole thing Serious fellowkids title there Great just in time for summer Reddit What kind of world do we live in where our memes arent even safe I wish youd stop crediting sole redditors for legislative achievements I know its good for your inflated egos but please  Were constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces from raising money for childrens hospitals to shutting down the inevitable SOPAPIPA Today European redditors along with other concerned EU netizens helped do the impossible once more How far up your own ass do you have to be to think that this one website singlehandedly accomplished these things Can someone please ELI what the fuck they have to gain by banning memes I understand its more complicated then that it has to do with harsher copyright laws right I totally understand that people with power will always try to fuck with the little guy and strip us of our freedoms but really why this It makes no sense to me its not even fully scrapped itll probably come back again shit like this just makes us forget about it because LE EBIL MEME BAN GONE GUIZE Why are you being disengenious and why wont you fix your own site deleted You really think comments and posts on reddit made the difference Youve got to be fucking joking And which fuckwits keep gilding people in this thread Stop buying that shit if you ever want to see the admins stop with the redesign and all the other shit they keep doing Why the fuck would you give reddit money when they continue down the path they are on I have a question however Since you felt that these news were worthy of a separate post announcement why we didnt or maybe Im blind and missed that in which case I apologize see any actions from the Reddits side to promote the issue and make people aware of it eg like Italian Wikipedia did by going blackout Oh shut up reddit admins you did absolute shit Glad this was stopped for now but everyone needs to remain vigilant The rich and powerful worldwide want to destroy the internet and we have to keep fighting them Fuck off it wasnt reddit at all Americans have shit all say in the eu It was the news mozilla Linux community and so on Reddit had virtually nothing to do with it you shallow self absorbed fuck Hopefully they dont do what lobbyists in america did and just keep trying over and over until they fuck everything up Great now how about we make this about the actual issues it causes such as freedom of critique and the functioning of Internet services instead of muh memes which is also wrong because the regulation specifically excluded them Thank goodness Now we wait a couple years for the next big thing to try and hinder the Internet Will this cycle ever end But what about Wikipedia They tried to destroy my spanish wikipedia its safe now Next is net neutrality reinstatement in the US hopefully How come Paul McCartney and other musicians were in favour  what did they have to gain from this having passed deleted Hey uarabscarab when will the admins stop dodging the elephant in the room and give a legitimate answer to the question Why shouldnt reddit have to share revenue with the content creators you sell advertisements against You keep repeating this statement like it is a bad thing and require licensing fees for all links Why is this bad Why should reddit be able to host via ireddit web comics and photographs of copyrighted content that doesnt belong to it and only have to take it down after the copyright holder finds it and requests it Why is forgiveness the only acceptable policy for you Why does reddit not have a revenue sharing program like YouTube already in place and why do you resist addressing repeated questions about it This is poorly written legislation as it was designed but its not a poor concept You host content from copyrighted content that isnt yours Not just links to articles but sometimes whole articles ripped from the source and reposted here Half of your major content is just mild tweakings of content copyrighted by others Most of the gif subs are straight rips outs of videos owned by someone else who gets no compensation for entertaining redditors while you put advertisements against them Why should reddit continue be able having a free lunch and not give back to the content creators whose stuff you use without asking to make a profit You want us to defend you I like reddit and want it to continue So give us the sound reasoning who you shouldnt have to pay out or have to restrict your site from making money off of content youre not authorized to host We want to support you but we cant win this fight without addressing this concern and it is a valid concern Its also the biggest hurdle you face as even yo know with your for now in the headline that this discussion is not over Help us help you and answer the question youve been hiding from I tried asking you this last time you made an announcement posthttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsqfwlprotectingthefreeandopeninterneteuropeanejkf it got a ton of support and was even gilded which made you guys a few bucks and you suddenly went silent on the page Why are you hiding and what is the answer It makes it very hard to support you when you wont address this question and arm us with the ability to defend you STOP MAKING THIS ABOUT MEMES FOR FUCKS SAKE Its so much more important than memes and youre sabotaging the campaign against this by making it look like the opposition is a bunch  year olds who dont want their memes banned The vast majority of people over  dont give a single fuck about memes and they are the ones voting for this Not something year old redditors So if you want to convince them use arguments they will hear Remember when Reddit broke its own rules and spammed the fuck out of Net Neutrality bullshit And it didnt work and then the internet died I had to send this comment by mail Nice meme Never seen people get guilded that fast in the comments Youre welcome for now Sincerely One of Your EU redditors Damn Reddit made  just from this post alone Gilds everywhere Reddit gives itself too much credit I think that the EU people voted the same as they would have if Reddit had not done anything Fuck off reddit God this is embarrassing This is not worthy of being an official announcement from the Reddit team we cant ban despacito  no sir Cant win them all but you can win some MBN to live in a country with the government actually care about the general public opinion and not how much a cooperation can give them The thing that worries me is what happens when we dont notice this shady bullshit and they slide it past us is this corporate telling us to keep it down with the resistance Anyone else ever just wanna go to poundtown on a squirrels tight little anus   Whats Next We get the EU to declare your redesign illegal We have won the battle but not the war This is only just the beginning Wtf is this Here I was thinking this was about the tremendous victory in rtrebuchetmemes I was planning to make them a meme so they have to block themselves Fucking stupid ass Partito Democratico approving they are the most bullshit corrupted politician in Italy i wanna FUCK judy hopps cringe What you gonna do Nothing because you cant sue me you dont know who I am Fuck off old bitches theres no way Im going to read all those lengthy comments Lol Governments trying to control too much nothing new Is this win Will smith meme can I see more than the thumbnail Memes are safu you fucking cucks they arent gonna listen to you this isnt about your memes this is about the EU political elite wanting to control your ability to spread information online While this is great I always find it strange when multibillion dollar corporations like Wendys or whatever use memes on their official accounts Like you CAN afford to compensate the artists who made that SpongeBob imagegif but you dont have to because it is a meme Feels odd I have more faith in Reddit than in humanity Please dont disappoint as a rTIFU mod thanks for not posting this there P PS As a bonus I have enabled filtering for rall for all users You can modify the filters by visiting rall on the desktop web Im old sorry but it will affect all platforms including our native apps on iOS and Android Is this going to last forever plz spez  You can filter rall now Thank god Best thing to come out of this PS As a bonus I have enabled filtering for rall for all users You can modify the filters by visiting rall on the desktop web Im old sorry but it will affect all platforms including our native apps on iOS and Android I think this should be much more noticeable to be honest Im surprised it doesnt have its own post thats one of the basic RES features people have asked for since forever to be on the site If anyone here wants to copy their RES filters over to the reddit filtering thing heres an easy way to do it  Open the RES filteReddit settings on rallhttpswwwredditcomrallressettingsfilteReddit  Press F and open the console tab  Copypaste this into the box at the bottom of the console and press enter filtereddetails inputsrnamevaloptionContainerfilteRedditsubreddits tbodysubreddits inputmapfunctionreturn thisvalgetjoin submit Youre done it copied your RES filters over into reddits add filters box and added them nbsp EDIT Added direct link to filteReddit settings fixed formatting and hopefully made the instructions a bit clearer EDIT  If you are using regex in your subreddit filters or you have more than  filters this might work filtereddetails inputsrnamevaloptionContainerfilteRedditsubreddits tbodysubreddits inputmapfunctionindex  if thisvalincludes  index    return thisval  getjoin submit It wont try to add more than  reddits filter cap and should ignore any filter containing regex Can you keep track of how many people filter subs I would love to see the amount of people filtering subs out of rall Imma take this opportunity to ask you something uspez id really like a way for me to find new subreddits on my frontpage without having to find a popular post or comment on rall or having to dig for it Especially the smaller niche communities Have you ever though of adding a recommended subreddits tab somewhere There definitely isnt one on the mobile app and I dont think there is one on the website EDIT Some people are mentioning wwwredditcomexplore  If only I had known about this sooner but to be honest doesnt really satisfy my concern as nice as it is I already found a hopefully interesting communityhttpswwwredditcomrModeratelyConfused How do you feel about ArsTechnicas David Kravetshttparstechnicacomtechpolicyredditchiefadmitstoeditingcommentsthatwerecriticalofhim comparing you to Ellen Pao and that despite all the hate she got she didnt stoop this low  Even Ellen Pao the former Reddit CEO didnt change comments despite a barrage of insults levied at her last year as the site began cleaning up its community ya big dummy didnt no one tell you to not feed the trolls It was not meant to circumvent organic voting which rthedonald does to slingshot posts into rall Is this really how so many posts got to the top of rall It seems crazy because now that they have no stickies there is nothing in the first  pages from thedonald even though the posts there have so many points Was something else put in place to stop them from reaching rall as much  Can any admin edit a commentpost How would we know  Has this ever happened before  Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a banworthy offense for a subreddit edit from me not uspez Really Im glad you saw it to apologize I was in the so fucking whatit was just a small edit camp but I can see why some people would be so angry about it It was poor judgement and you put yourself in a loselose situation That said most of us will still use the site as before because I honestly cant think of any other content aggregator like this one Im also glad you guys finally got around to implementing the subreddit blocking feature Id done that with RES a long time and I truly didnt understand why people were so bent out of shape over rthedonald If the charges about doxxing harassment etc are true and I can see it happening then the questions to ask are  is the sub responsible for it If yes then what do reddits policies say about this behavior  if the sub isnt responsible then how are you  evaluating the truth in this accusation  taking action to protect reddit from other websites and social media  planning to prevent something like this power user getting harassed to the point of doing something extremely sillyunprofessional from every happening again Thank you for this May I suggest you bring on an ombudsmanhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiOmbudsman Large organizations that count on the public trust have long considered an ombudsman to be a good approach to enforcing transparency and balance Reddit has become an international news and opinion platform used by a wide range of people so it seems like a good time to consider bringing on this kind of oversight The mod team of rNeutralPolitics shameless plug frequently has to deal with situations where a disagreement between users with diametrically opposed views goes off the rails and crosses the line from a political discussion to a personal argument Were intimately familiar with the need to include a variety of views in decisionmaking to state our policies openly and provide transparency in the way we implement them But doing so requires being dedicated to those principles first and foremost and for an organization with the size and dynamism of reddit the best way to do that would be with an independent oversight person or team I hope youll consider it Cheers and thank you again You can now filter rall WEVE COME FULL CIRCLE deleted deleted Is there any way to temporarily disable filters other than logging out or opening a private window Sometimes I like to see what rall looks like without my filters in place Edit I figured out a hacky way to do it Just go to rallnull Hellllll yes They ruined Reddit for everyone but their own community and if this is what it took to get Reddit back Im happy about it Thanks chief So do you still have the ability to ninja edit anyones post or is that not a thing reddit admins can do anymore Because I think that should be a thing that reddit admins literally cannot do Edit by this I mean that adminsengineerswhatever shouldnt be able to edit without it being marked not that they shouldnt be able to edit at all I understand that its not possible for the latter to happen Implementing the filter for rall is a reasonable solution If moderators want to ban anyone who dissents with their community fine As a user I should have the same ability to ban your posts from my view If Im not allowed to post my opinion on your community then dont force me to see yours on rall Of course the downside is the further creation of echochambers and disconnected communities Sometimes twoway or zeroway roads are better than oneway roads The United States is more divided than ever You people realize there was a period in our history when the United States was literally divided right Thank you thank you thank you deleted rthedonald is a deep and large well of negativity and hate Yeah Ive been a daily user of Reddit for  years now and I truly dont care I like Reddit You can do whatever you want and I wont stop coming here So just saying You probably dont hear this side too often So a this is fucking hilarious And b I had managed to avoid clicking on anything linked to rTheDonald for the last  months Clicking on uspezs apology actually got me to visit that subreddit Skimming it for  seconds has made me feel really sad  Posts stickied on rthedonald will no longer appear in rall Why not all subreddits If this behaviour is toxic why not block it completely Other subs could exploit it Holy shit thanks spez now I can finally filter rpolitics out of rall  I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for particularly over the holidays hmmmmmm CEO does something loudly decried by an annoying minority and causes other people to clean it up over a  day weekend scott adams are you listening i think youve got a weeks worth of dilbert strips out of this Hi spez Related to the editing incident and trust in this article in New York Magazinehttpnymagcomdailyintelligencerredditfounderstevehuffmanhtml it says  After leaving Huffman found that he had a hard time letting go He still had administrative access to the site and continued tinkering with its code Once that access was cut off he found a back door for another six months before finally being locked out Am I correct that this means you could still do things like edit users posts view their private data including private messages and subreddits shadowban users etc for a long period of time while not even working at reddit any more If that is true its extremely alarming and raises a lot of questions including  Why did you need administrative access after quitting  What supervision was there of a nonemployee with admin access  Have there been other nonemployees with admin access Are there any right now  How was it acceptable or even legal to use a back door to take back privileged access that the company clearly didnt want you to have Update German Police caught possible Paris Attacker  days ago had AKs and kg TNT in car Police checked suspects car and found a professionally built hiding place with

La France My husband and I started dating in July  In January  his grandfather a Frenchman passed away from cancer We smuggled his ashes into France illegal I know and scattered them in his hometown Douai We then went back to Paris which his grandfather adored and had your standard brilliant time When my husband asked me to marry him that October I asked him shortly after when he knew he wanted to marry me He told me it was when we were in Paris after we came back from Douai and that he thought of the  years his grandparents had spent together and that he knew standing on the top of the Eiffel Tower that he never wanted to be apart from me My answer to the same question was nearly identical Paris has that way about it It makes you fall in love whether its with the city itself its art its history its architecture its poetrythe list goes on Theres no mystery that this city has been beloved by artists writers and poets the world over My husband and I were no different And tonight seeing pictures of bodies and watching videos of firefights and military marching through the streets I thought of my husbands grandfather who had watched Paris fall to the Germans and how heartbroken and angry he would be if he were here to see it We love you France My grandfather loved you and taught me your language Paris was the defining moment in the most wonderful relationship Ive ever known in my life My heart breaks for you and for all the wives at home tonight whose husbands will never come home and all the others as well  Counteract some of the evil by taking extra time out of your

family in Paris right now and I appreciated the constant source of information as to what was going on You stood with us when we needed it and we stand with you now and always Vive La France with love from New York say one say all Vive la France Whenever shit like this happens I immediately become sick at what humanity is capable of I wonder how we could do things like this Why would you just mow down people who are trying to go out on a friday night and have a good time Why would you take the life of a person who has not done anything to hurt you But then I think of the other side I think of the fact that the guy that makes me sandwiches at the corner store is from Yemen and he worries about his family all the time  they can just die in a bombing in a shooting in a war zone just like that I think of the fact that these people want the same things we do  they want good health and peace for themselves and their families  but they have to worry about bombs falling out of the sky We take that for granted in the west Honestly if I grew up watching my cousins and brothers and sisters and parents and children dying in attacks or bombings coordinated by foreign governments  I would think very little about the cost of a life and I would think nothing about taking one or many Every life taken by a bomb that falls from the sky CREATES a dozen new terrorists I am not the type to talk about peace and love but I do think that the remedy for terrorism is compassion and maybe we would do best to consider this when we vote American flags should be at half staff for our sister Without France supporting us we wouldnt be where we are today Someone send Zidane to headbutt whoever did this As a human being this was terrifying The live thread was helpful to locals and proactive in

and to muslim immigrants in general so I ask Allah for ease after these hard times Ameen This is the attack everybody has been dreading for at least a couple of years This is really important because it is the essence of terrorism it is not only about people being killed it is about creating a political effect What worries me the most is that we will see in France and other European countries a polarisation with different extremists egging each other on People on the far right trying to take advantage Its about dividing societies This was a big attack but even relatively small attacks are dangerous because of the political situation because of the chain reaction they can cause  Peter Neumann Professor of Security Studies Kings College London Its time we came together as one  France USA

those cowardly shittledicks that did this Condolences from New York USA I dont get it What is the goal of the terrorists Assuming they are Muslim they just made life harderworse for every Muslim not

original ally and we can never forget that Vive la France and much more than that We are here for you and even more than possible We are one I really appreciate the live feed feature of Reddit Its often the best source for curated info on an unfolded situation anywhere on the web Thanks everyone I know the point of all this was to scare us and that we shouldnt be scared I live in a pretty obscure area of california but for some reason im freaken scared now I have no idea why but this incident makes me realize you really dont know about the person next to you god i know how stupid this sounds but im just scared in general France were with you through this tragedy Stay strong and dont let fear back you down We stand together as one in the face of threats and terrorism Britain sends our love We stand by you France I live in paris and work nearby the places that were hit yesterday I had half a dozen friends locked up in nearby bars last nigh Lucky for me none were harmed Last night i felt sick watching things unfold before my eyes but i honestly were not surprised Well actually i am i am surprised that the death count is that low Eight basterds with heavy weapons and explosives A stadium filled with people a concert hall packed with  people This demonstrates how fuckin stupid those guy are They re that brain damaged that even with the means of killing thousands of people they managed to fortunately fuck it up  dudes blow themselves nearby the stadium and killed  ppl Including them I cant imagine how terrible things would have been if those cunts had waited for people to come out after the game Anyway At some point there needs to be a real military intervention against daesh This situation is not an al quaida situation We re here dealing with a real physical entity One that has borders politics These people need to be crushed now I ll even go further Great nations need to stop being hypocritical Since ww and the end of colonization conquest war are considered over But they re really not They just happend differently through huge companies that trust resources and exploit local people To an end this is way worse that our good old conquest wars At least those had the positive impact that by anexing land there was an actual improvement over time of the local s way of life infrastructures etc Those were actually including conquered people in a new demographic Instead we harvest create poverty and accept that small group of motherfucker terrorize local population This all this All pas terror events Is nothing but the repercutions of shy hypocritical cold war like world politics of the western world Leaders thought that they could keep on claiming the world witjout actually fightin for it Amazing they didnt see that the fight would end up on their doorstep This has to change now Only naive people can believe that war is avoidable at all level It s time to conquer or be killed And saudi arabia should be on the top list Just to be clear I feel for all humans I dont hate anyone but those who hate I understand peacefull people who thinks that conquest is just as bad and that decolonization was needed despite the fact that i disagree Thing is i dont believe wars will ever disappear So might as well include those who lose their country and embrace them as part of us instead of just eaving them with a broken land After all france usa germany etc Those physical entities are nothing more but the result of wars and conquest At all point in their history people were stripped from a part of their culture and identity But luckily only to grow bigger more complexed ones So why would our time be any different Were just stalling Settling with half measures Enough deleted I was too young to remember  well People always told me that the feeling of what youre experiencing cant be described by words Now I know that they cant People always told me they remember where they were and what they were doing when  happened I now know what they mean Thoughts and prayers going out to the Parisians and the French in general As much as we joke and complain about redditors and fight amongst our cliques you guys can be pretty cool sometimes Whatever happens DO NOT SHOW THE PICTURES OR NAMES of the the cowards that did this They feed on this attention Let them die unnamed and unknown Normally people joke how France is quick to surrender Not today France will not surrender to fear Australia is with you So now that IS claimed the terrorist attacks can we please unite to put a stop on those guys Its getting ridiculous today is the arrival of Saint nick a Dutch children holiday and we have to take precautions because all the Shit thats happening around us Anyway my sincere condolences and sympathies for the friends

goes out to the victims but my mind is pretty occupied thinking about how badly this can go for the next decade or more httpimgurcomLyAhNd This one is from Belgrade Serbia On behalf of all the Muslims

needed to reregister as a new voter because they couldnt find me in the system Worst part is they found my wife at the same address just fine As a software engineer I just have to wonder WTF are these systems and who the F is responsible for keeping them accurate and up to date IMO all of this needs to be open source and in the public domain Rant Eventually they got me in and I got a full ballot but it took me waiting for  minutes while the workers there called superiors to figure out wtf to do with me I had to keep insisting that I didnt want a provisional ballot Stay persistent today folks I early voted and suggest all consider it to avoid crowds or issues on the day When I vote I keep my opinions to myself and treat everyone at or near voting site with respect We may differ in opinion but we can act like decent creatures to each other as we vote A bit of housekeeping as well  be aware that in some states such as here in California you are not allowed to wear campaign materials to the polls I imagine that a lot of precincts dont actually care that much but better safe than sorry I work over an hour from where I live Can I vote near my work or do I need to leave early to go home to vote Work and home are in same state but different counties EDIT In line to vote now  No problems Thanks for all the help this is gonna sound incredibly silly but TURN YOUR BALLOT OVER just in case mine was handed to me with the county referendum side facing up which does not instruct you to turn it over and did not say  of  or anything similar the gubernatorial and all the congressional races were on the opposite side which then instructs you to turn the ballot over wwwvoteorg is pretty convenient and has your ballot information plus breakdowns on the candidates for quick perusal Saw this in the Christianity sub and even if youre not religious I feel like its something that everyone should see In  John Wesley met with those in a Methodist society who had votes in a coming election and advised them  To vote without fee or reward for the person they judged most worthy  To speak no evil for the person they voted against  To take care their spirits were not sharpened against those on the other side Thankful that Washington state is an all mail in state AND finally decided to pick up the postage for the ballots Ive never had a problem stamping up or dropping them in a drop box but I hope it helps more of my neighbors get their ballots in and vote As someone from Australia where voting is compulsory please take the time to carefully view the policies of the respective candidates you have to choose from A single vote can make all the difference but most importantly vote for change who you believe in Some countries dont even have the opportunity to participate in a voting democracy So I voted this morning in Dallas County Texas I was a couple days late to register in my state and I went ahead and went anyway and requested a provisional ballet as thats what a coworker suggest I do I did receive my voter card but it stated it wouldnt be active until the th The guy who gave me the ballet tried to tell me not to bother as it would just be thrown out I insisted to fill it out anyway and he let me and did the paper work but through the whole process he kept reminding me it wouldnt count itll be thrown out Im not sure what to do and I cant seem to find the information I dont know if he was allowed to tell me those things But I fear someone else will just come in and leave after being told that Does anyone have any light to shed on this Edit Ive already reported this to the appropriate authorities If the guy did nothing wrong then nothing will come of it and life will move on Just wanted information did not mean to kick a bee hive and stir up debates Both sides need to chill He was probably  right and it wont count But I insisted and he did let me fill out the relevant paperwork and cast my provisional ballet Itll be reviewed by a board within a day or so and well see then I would vote if I were American Im Malaysian and we managed to overthrow the corrupt party that had been ruling us since our independence in  this year by voting They cheated and yet we still won So my American friends vote It makes a difference removed I do not care who you vote for but please do it Take the time to read up on the bills and candidates and everything else on the ballot and make a decision based on what you believe is best for the country Informed voting is the greatest way to participate in America today Edit httpsballotpediaorgSampleBallotLookuputmsourceballotpediautmcampaignsampleballotfrontpage If you have trouble with trying to be informed on everything on your ballot ballotpedia is a good unbiased source I just went to my polling area for my current address and requested a provisional ballot but the election official just told me it wont count anyway and turned me away Im registered to vote in my home district in Ohio but currently live on a university campus and brought proof of my current address to the polling station Is there a way I can demand my provisional ballot at the station Im British so Im inclined to hate being notified of every post that exclusively appeals to America but folks you need to get out there and vote Dont be a muppet Maybe some kind soul someone explain to me as a nonAmerican who isnt versed in American politics well what these elections mean realistically Are you guys voting for a party Or voting for a single representative If its a local representative are the votes counted like the electoral commission where some states have more voting power than the other or is it just outright numbers If the republicans democrats get the majority vote what would that mean for the current administration and how would it affect the current leadership Thanks edit Thank you all for the replies Ive learned a lot today deleted When do we get to vote for the new reddit ceo As a friendly canadian i urge my american compatriots please get out and vote today Today was the first time I really voted in something that mattered Literally took  minutes to go in vote and get out I cannot believe how easy it was and Im very upset with myself for not voting as soon as I had the chance I used to think my vote didnt matter but now I can say I at least tried to change things for the better If you are on the fence just do it you will feel so much better We can make this country a better place by spending the  minutes it takes to vote VOTE If you voted CONGRATS You want to help promote elections Deal with the bots Reddit Do some clean up Youve been pathetic in the past Informative and convenient working as a poll worker we are having a great turn out so far Can we vote to remove Spez I voted for the first time today in Northern Michigan and I was happy to do it I was wondering if other Michiganders used black Sharpie markers to fill out the ballot I thought it was weird at the time but looking back Im wondering if someone switched pens for sharpies in an effort to discredit ballots Just voted in Oklahoma Hopefully shit will change here we cant have another four years of the same stuff weve been dealing with My voting station had a  year old girl having people sign their name in the binder and an  year old man running the electronic voting system It went exactly as you would have expected Positive note this year the election judge wasnt sleeping like he was in  I always enjoy how easy the NY ballots are you get a giant scantron that separates parties into columns dont understand why other states dont use them Just got back from voting myself but for anyone who hasnt and wants some quick info for local candidates check out Vote Smart Theyve got the positions  records of candidates for your state  district httpsvotesmartorg Voting is awesome Say Ive seen my sample ballot and there are some measures to vote on in the sample Is there a place where I can find the current laws in place and compare them to the measures up for vote or a more indepth description of the new measures I always end up feeling like the descriptions are inadequate on the ballot or current legislation is difficult to find for comparison Yup I voted  I requested an absentee ballot weeks ago and it never came in the mail Im temporarily residing outside of the US and all the electronic documentation that I received when I requested said that I would get one theres no reason to believe my request would be denied What should I do Crazy how many new

general climate brought upon by the politics of the last couple of years but could the Admins please do something to encourage Reddit becoming a place for civil discussions and reasonable discussions rather than shouting matches and banouts Dont believe the troll accounts which suddenly emerged  They are trying to convince you that you are outnumbered  They are trying to discourage you in a last minute effort Laugh at them downvote and move on What do you do if your state never sent you your absentee ballot form and now you cant make it to your polling location Edit New York State deleted when i went and voted today i accidentally marked the wrong choice for governor i went back up to the desk for a new ballot and the kind gentleman promptly informed me that the machine would not count my vote if i marked hard enough on the paper for the ink to bleed through i marked as lightly as i could and EVERY SINGLE DOT had bled through when i was done every marker they had was a black sharpie does that mean none of those votes will count Wasnt able to vote this morning epic clusterf at my polling area Basically I stood around for almost an hour then had to leave to get to work on time Last paragraph of this link applies to my situation httpswwwkolotvcomcontentnewsProblemsreportedatseveralpollinglocationsinmultiplecountieshtml Anybody else think the cartoon Uncle Sam at the bottom of OP looks like Mr Moneybags if that is his name from the board game Monopoly Will you post announcements like this for all countries that have national elections I wasnt going to vote today I forgot to fill out my mail ballot and Ive just been really busy with school and work lately but seeing this post was one of the few things that actually tipped me off to travel back to my hometown by train vote and immediately return back to Chicago so I can study for my midterm exams lol How about YOU vote to keep Tencents totalitarian claws out of Reddit admins Why no announcements about that deleted Any good resources for watching results tonight Id love some sort of interactive map or live feed map Something that shows what the map was and what its become like was red now blue Just a reminder that

Love prepaid absentee voting Only thing missing is the I VOTED sticker but I can live without that You should add this tool that lets you see where people in your area stand on Net Neutrality using the Zip Code search at httpswwwvotefornetneutralitycom Tried going to the link to see if I can REGISTER and VOTE today but cant click on the click here on the website Can anybody help me Im in North Carolina Please and thank you Why am I here Im not even American I wish we have something like this in Japan Dont forget to check iSideWithcom for a short quiz that will set out the candidates that align with your political views I thought I was moderate I always thought I was more Republican than Democrat or at least a Liberal Republican or a Moderate Democrat Turns out Im a pretty solid Democrat with several stances that lean towards Socialism and a few that lean more Libertarian This site is great iSidewithcom made it so easy I finally voted for the first time Ive always wanted to but either I couldnt register in time or was too overwhelmed by the research that I never did it Im seriously like on a voting high rn FTexas Why do the news show winners with the numbers currently saying otherwise Says the republican is going to take the win with  while the democrat has  Uncle Sam doesnt have a moustache Can we vote on getting old Reddit back I cant vote yet Im  in April but I will next year for sure I dont want my country to go to shit more than it has Would be awesome if you could use location services to automatically hide this for people outside the US If you can do it for targeted ads theres no reason you cant do it for this fucking voting spam that has been going on for weeks Very tired of it Dems just won the house Easy Sorts by controversial Just voted  Those of you who have to wait in line wait You can always browse Reddit to pass the time  Lets be honest nobody wants people to vote They just want you to vote for who they vote for I love this Thanks guys for putting this out there Why did I expect this thread to be anything but a shitshow If youre in CA vote NO on prop  httpswwwredditcomremscommentslxwlacaliforniavotenoonprop It sounds like a good idea but actually means ems wont be paid for interrupted breaks and wont have protected breaks or a rescheduled break if theirs is interrupted When will you address the political hate group operating on your website How about you do your part and delete the dangerous extremists subreddits Thank you Jay very cool Russians or whoever are pushing to have people not votelots of odd replies I just voted here in Fresno CA and because I was wearing an antitrump shirt the poll worker said I have to cover it up I repilied thats my freedom of speech She then said its against the law to influence other people inside the polling place I put on my sweater and still voted but is she in the right to do that I am not American I unsubscribed from all Americancentric politics subs and now it pops up on rannouncements  And why do i see this Ads know im from Argentina and attacks me with hundreds of ads related to my country and you share with me a guide to vote in the US Im not even subscribed here As a non us citizen can someone explain what does this election determine Check out VoteSmartorghttpsVoteSmartorg if youd like to learn more about a candidates views on an issue They are nonbiased and do not attempt to guess at a candidates views If they cannot find the candidates views in no uncertain terms they state the candidates views as unknown Surly the best advice is that its polling day in AMERICA Not the rest of the whole world Again Not all redditors are from the US Confession I will not be voting today because I mailed in my ballot last month why is voting in US trending everywhere how about we promote elections in other countries reddit as well Start by deleting the propaganda boards you dipshits I am working the polls in San Marcos CA Happy to report that we have had a steady stream of voters in the first  hours Can we get a remember this device feature Its annoying having to whip our my phone every time I log in on my work computer Was  your onetimepassword Thats so lucky Heaven forbid my reddit account is hacked and posts some thing positive about thief scam artist Johann Gevers Can we get some protection against bots Can you start working on threefactor authentication Feedback After I enabled FA I was able to disable it whilst being still logged into my account but without being prompted for a FA code or generated backup code I checked using Incognito mode logging in cleanly and I was still able to disable it without requiring a FA code So before if a coworkerspousefriend jumped my computer they already werent able to change my Reddit password without me having the option of resetting it to my email but now they can click  buttons to enable FA and I get locked out of my own account with no method of recourse to get it back  This isnt a good design especially with a log me out from everywhere button I dont want to scope creep the project but that seems like it should be within reasonable security scopethreat model But I do understand the trade off people losing their phones and such So I would think the solution may be best left up to the user An SMS notification perhaps but peoples number may change when they lose their phone anyway too SMS is not secure but anyone who knows that would be using a seperate option which would be a default unchecked checkbox which says I agree that I must provide a FA code or a backup code to deactivate FA OR THIS SETTING Also having to prompt for a FA code to get my backup codes would be good So someone cant come along and have a list of  secret codes to use against me later down the line if they figure out my passwordemail account details and at that time they wouldnt need to compromise my phone at the same time Pretty UI stuff On the Enable TwoFactor setup screen you have to click Enter the key manually to get the image back that text should update Secondly When you login the button to submit your FA code says Check code I would suggest it should just be Submit Thats a blur of the lines between implementation which is literally checking the code and usagewhich is someone using it is going to legitimately be just submitting you the code they have If I havent been clear feel free to ask for clarification why almost all of my reddit accounts have been to talk shit to strangers when they disagree with me I think it would be nice to have a backup like the possibility to use a UF hardware token to use instead of your phone This way it could be more securereliant and its way easier to just use a token instead of a authenticator app Be careful when using Google auth If your phone suddenly breaks youre sol I ask every time you guys talk about FA are you planning on supporting physical UF tokens like Yubikeys I prefer that to Auth apps Edit i missed part of my thought in my original comment My passwords so good that I dont even know it What about uf andor classic yubico OTP Having to enter a  digit number by hand is a serious nuisance for me Hardware token is much less friction Im suppose to trust Stringer Bell Is Clay Davis in on this too If someone is seriously gonna waste their time hacking my dumb account they can keep it tbh So glad that this is being released to everyone Its worked very well for me since beta Pro tip If you use any script  bot to login with a FAd account or you dont get prompted for the  factor code then in the password field just do YourPasswordFactorCode ex Hunter If you use RES and the Account Switcher it has support as well if you click the FA toggle then it will ask you for the code when you switch accounts Thank you so much for adding FA Ive been using it for around a month and Ive had no issues with it  What about uf Security keys Heres another vote for UF Damn Hunter isnt going to work anymore If someone wants my account to this dump badly enough they can have it Been using this as a moderator for the past few months now and its been working great Thank you One follow up question though Any update on having some sort of icon that indicates when a moderator has FA enabled so we can hassle other members of our team to turn it on This icon ideally only being visible to other moderators so we dont advertise who on the team is least secure what about recovery codes these are generated as well right I dont care about my reddit account Do people care enough about reddit to use fa ubash you silly goose now I get to hackerman your account Authy doesnt have an icon for Reddit is it possible to reach out to them about that just makes it harder for me to look through every other Generic Blue icon for one that might or might not be my Reddit account People hack Reddit accounts What reason I can understand  step for email PayPal and eBay but why reddit All I have to say about this is DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL THEY HAVE WORKED OUT ALL THE BUGS Mods support across Reddit is limited and if you mess up on authenticating you WILL be locked out of your account At least thats been my experience with Apples twofactor verification I had to tell someone that their brandnew iPad Pro they just bought is now a fancy paperweight because they forgot their authentication credentials Theres no coming back from that even unless if you have a receipt this guy threw his away Granted Reddit isnt a  device but it would be extremely annoying to be locked out of your Reddit account until an extremely overworked volunteer mod can verify your credentials assuming mods have the admin rights to do this That could be hours days hell even weeks If its Reddits tech support only that will have these admin rights it could be permanent And frankly the vast majority of people on Reddit have little to no need for this kind of security considering that Reddit is basically just a bulletin board full of shitposts and a tiny bit of really usable information Its not like they have access to your financial records nbsp From the admin reply below me It is extremely unlikely that we will allow our volunteer mods access to anything to do with authentication for anyone elses account Also confirmed my assessment Verified email address to unlock About damn time now get it right by adding UF instead of only TOTP Cool Secure shits always cool but like Unless Reddit start going into the banking industry or storing sensitive emails I dont think I personally need this here Itd just be more of a hassle than its worth for a site that doesnt have sensitive info on me Wait hold on Did someone give the reddit admins gold Yeah I see its showing appreciation and I fucking agree but ehh Seriously though who the fuck cares that much about a reddit account Imagine being this paranoid about your imaginary goodboy points on the worlds nd shittiest website Thanks for listening and implementing this Why no UF deleted ProTip enable FAMFA on any important logins you have Thank you for this I wish more sites would offer FA I honestly did not know Amazon offered FA but they do So the other day I was on Amazon looking at cards I play a Japanese card game called Wei Schwarz when I saw I had  worth of stuff in my cart What you ask Well sit down and let me tell you  copies of one item That one item  colored balls for a ball pit Lets do the math Thats  colored balls They were not able to complete the sale and I found no new addresses in my address book So long story short I secured my account Thank you Ive been using FA for a few months now without any issues Works perfectly from my experience Can you please add the option for subreddits to require moderators to have FA enabled to access mod features How do I enable this on mobile Was confused at first but for some reason the FA heading for me is shown as Rules Probably an issue with the enGB locale Any idea of how this would play with using Alien Blue THANK YOU for making this optional Its mandatory on a lot of services I apply to and having to whip out my cell phone every time I sign on to them is ridiculous Protip Once you have more than a dozen or so FA accounts it gets annoying to scroll through Authenticator Get AuthentictorPlus which can have categories folders for your sites Protip Chrome has personas so different windows can have entirely different sets of cookies plugins etc Use that for your personal login work login and pron login Firefox has a plugin that does the same thing Hey thanks this is a good call and I appreciate the work Would I get  additional bag slots FA the hottest new cryptocurrency Thanks so much for not going the phone number route Had to enable this instantly We all needed this step Thank you you lost me at requires an authenticator app When is FIDO and UTF going to be added Major companies that havent gone multifactor by now are slow Everyone reuses credentials Telling older folks to use different passwords is the same as telling them to lose their accounts one by one to attrition Its official Reddit now has better logon security options than my fucking bank Youre not getting my email thank you may hacked accounts and defaced subreddit CSS be a thing of the past What can they steal if they hack into your Reddit account Thanks for finally rolling this out to everyone Wouldnt want someone losing all my karma with bad posts Its just a reddit account Who gives a shit I asked this before when this was rolled out to mods Is there a way for sub mods to see if other mods of the same sub are using FA Im the head mod on a couple subs and Id like to enforce the mods below me to use FA on their accounts to retain mod status Just out of curiosity how prevalent is account hacking anyways deleted deleted Because reddit accounts are serious business  no No Twofactor authentication is the bain bane of google and other sites I hope its not a bitch here too Oh finally and only three weeks after my account was compromised and locked still waiting for a response to my several PMs and emails after three weeks please please stop ignoring me Ive become a naturalized citizen last year and Im excited to vote I got my voter card and ID ready I never had this oppertunity before in my life My family fled from Cambodia during the genocide and I was born in a refugee camp on the border of Thailand For the longest time I felt like a man with no country because I was born in Thailand but parents are Cambodian living in the United States I came to the states when I was around  years old Im  years old It took a good chunk of money to be a citizen of the United States and alot of patience But anyways Ill see everyone at the polls One of my friends has had her registration purged by the state multiple times in the past year Make sure you check before going to the polls Mod of rExCons here In all but  states exoffenders can vote once theyve completed their sentence including parole or probation In several you can vote as soon as youre released and in Maine and Vermont you can vote while still incarcerated Every states laws are different and its not always easy to keep track A woman in Texas was sent back to prison for five years for trying to vote while on parole She filled out a provisional ballot on the advice of the poll worker when she explained she didnt know if she was allowed to or not The poll worker didnt know either Make sure you know your states rules Theyre listed here httpswwwnonprofitvoteorgvotinginyourstatespecialcircumstancesvotingasanexoffender Edit OHIOANS vote YES on Issue  to eliminate prison time for low level drug offenses and probation violations FLORIDIANS vote YES on Amendment  to give most felons the right to vote Expatriates or anyone whos abroad you can also register and request your ballot on Vote From Abroadhttpsvotefromabroadorg Alternatively you can also use httpsfvapgov to register but with this site you also need to make sure you send in a ballot request as well as your registration Just got my absentee ballot in the mail today Thank goodness I dont have to ever go to the physical polls anymore Now I can research at home at my own pace and send it in whenever I like Wisconsin folks  in  Wisconsin voters have been purged from the rolls Please go to myvotewigov to check your status and register The first presidential election I ever voted in came down to less than  votes The recount caught national attention but thousands of irregularities went largely unnoticed We had  at a single precinct Even big national elections can come down to a handful of votes Your vote matters No Im not because Im not from America Good luck Americans Register well Registration doesnt mean anything if you dont vote US citizens encourage your state to adopt a votebymail initiative like Oregon has to raise voter turnout I registered shortly before my th birthday Oct  and Ive voted in  of the  elections since I missed a single in off year in  because I was away at school and didnt make time to fill out an absentee ballot I will sure as Hell be voting on Nov  and Ill never miss another election again I truly hope more young people like me have learned the importance of voting and will follow suit Yes Ive been registered for close to two decades To my fellow Americans Your vote may not mean much on the state or federal level but it can count for a LOT locally where Ive seen races decided by just a few votes Even if the nation is going to hell you can at least make an impact on your immediate area  your mayor city council judges depending on state etc Theyll probably have more of a direct impact on your day to day life anyway Enough people getting involved locally can then possibly have a snowball effect upticket Or yknow whatever Its actually a better use of resources to get registered but nonvoters to vote Not only am I registered but every time I get my sample ballot I try to look up the candidates to see which one is the best to vote for Even in the primaries Hell even for judges who normally have nothing about their political views online College students remember you have to vote where you are registered If you go to a school away from your parents home and you registered to vote at home you need to go home to vote file an absentee ballot or change your voter registration to your new residence North Dakota doesnt register voters All you need to do to vote is just show up and give them your ID Its kind of nice actually Im registered but Ive just moved to a different state and I need to declare everything before I can do that do I still have time to do that Also i believe Lyft is offering free rides for voters As an Australian if Im registered to vote in America something has gone wrong Registered today and doing a mail in ballot Slip the lines and still doing my Civic duty Oh fuck thanks for reminding me I have to finish my absentee registration Not only are both my wife and myself registered and have been  in  different states over the past  years  but we receive our ballots by mail for every election That enables us to do our due diligence in researching the candidates carefully over a considered period of time before completing our ballots at home and dropping them off at a nearby collection site Im registered to vote in Texas but Im going to be out of the country during the election so Im trying to get an absentee ballot From what Ive looked at it looks like I have to mail a FVAP form and then request the ballot mailed to me Is there an online way to get my ballot or do I need to do this by mail Kinda curious why this was posted when most of the US is asleep Please vote people To do so make sure you are registered Here are the deadlines to register  httpswwwvoteorgvoterregistrationdeadlines Here is the link to register  httpswwwvoteorgregistertovote DO IT NOW  million eligible voters did not register or vote in  do you think it will be more or less in  Older voters vote  to  to younger voters and people complain why their vote doesnt matter People complain about district redrawings when they dont vote in the off years for governors It is interesting how people out of the United States are so interested in elections they cannot vote for Register and Vote every other topic is kaka de toro As you can see from the comments there are plenty of shills trying to stop you from making your voice heard Anyone trying to convince you not to vote has an agenda and theres a good chance its not in your favor Your voice matters Your vote matters Can we vote to cancel the redesign I never voted before but I will for the first time this coming November Anything I should know as a noobie can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US Sometimes they just purge you for no reason Im registered thanks for reminding me We got our ballots in the mail today Registered and voting  Voting in my first midterm and what an important midterm it is Thanks for the link I had requested an absentee ballot last month but hadnt heard any follow up on that request I was able to check the status of my absentee request Its in progress Never knew I

able to vote for the first time ever so excited Always make sure you are registered And PLEASE vote How do I register while studying abroad Are there websites that give information about each name in the ballot I found websites that list all of the nominees but Id love to see some bullet points about their positions on issues and other info Hell yes I am It surprises me when I run into people who have no idea how to a register or b where to vote I make sure to point them to the right resources but I have been voting since I was eligible in every election Elections have consequences people I am not registered to vote and when I try to register online I get a message saying that The changes you requested were rejected Maybe you tried changing something you dont have access to Im not really sure what to do from here Im  and have never voted before Awful I know Please save the speech I am over it hence why I am registering so I dont really have any background on what to do Hell yea been registered since   year and ill be voting Im no expert in politics but I do enjoy the thought of efficiency I may not have done enough research on this I may be crazy for asking Is there an app or website I can logon to with my SSN DOB License  andor another means of verification and register to vote or vote If there is Or If Im crazy Let me know Thanks Not an expert Thank you for the reminder Just registered Sick of all the bullshit from the right lately Show them what it costs them rbluemidterm  go fuck em up boys and girls Holy shit these comments are depressing Truly hoping that many of these my vote doesnt matter comments are satire the american voting system is dumb in sweden they just send you a voting card to whatever address youre documented to live in that voting card involves information on how to vote by post prior to the electionday and where you go to vote on electionday if you choose to vote like that the place you vote will generally speaking always be within walking distance of your address Also a friendly reminder to those of us yanks living overseas  depending on what state youre from you may need to begin applying for your absentee NOW to make sure it arrives on time Illinois for example makes it a bit of a process but quite doable if you start early Yes I have Got registered a few years ago and I peek every once and awhile to make sure Im still registered as an active voter I will be soon I am registered as fuck I got chosen to work the poll and the ADA booth and Im super excited about it Yup I was able to register just in time for the presidential general election Me and Bill Cosby will be registered today albeit for two different things Yes  everybody needs to make an effort to vote this November It really does make a difference Id like if more people voted Universal suffrage is younger than me just and its a shame more people arent getting involved Why arent you demanding our government to set a voting holiday or a time to vote on a Saturday All you Americans go get registered and then turn out to vote in November Democracy requires participation do your civic duty and help shape the direction the country will be going I registered and convinced my friend to vote as well We both live in a closecontest between the republican and democratic candidate and Im excited about the possibility of it flipping You guys have to register to vote Weird Hey rTheDonald brigaded another announcement thread before the rest of reddit gets here Misinformation speculation lies and fear mongering about a globalist Where have I seen that before I totally forgot Thanks for the reminder  Remember one vote might not seem like a lot but many together can change the world Yes I am I used to be one of those people who cared but didnt vote I thought it didnt matter Fighting against the man or whatever Now I see what happens when good men stay silent Ive been registered for nearly  years but the state of Texas is dicking with me this time I moved and filed a change of address but there was a problem with the apartment dishwasher flooded the place on my first night there so I moved again and filed another change of address The apartments are in different counties though they are only about a quarter of a mile apart That apparently kicked something out in their system and prevented me from registering in my new district I have jumped through hoops to get reregistered including providing a copy of my birth certificate and CRBA military family but they wont budge I have written my congresspeople and I believe that one is sincere in their desire to help We will see if I can get registered in time Very frustrated with all of this In the process of moving right now Literally the day after we closed on the new house I sent in my updated registration information Beto For Texas Yall The first thing you americans should do is push for a change regarding this whole register to vote bullshit You should be able to show up with your identification passport goverment issued id etc at any polling station in the nation and be able to cast your vote Polling stations should be open from am to am aka the whole day Anyone over  should be eligible to vote You should not settle for less Imho anything less than this is not real democracy When you start picking and choosing who can cast a vote youre not really a democracy Deadline to register is  days before the election You can register online through your state website or by mail I just did it because I have moved and it only took two minutes Edit Sorry there are different deadlines depending on your state America is the only country in the world where you can ask someone if theyre registered to vote and their answer can be Im not sure Instead of encouraging people to register fix the stupid system where American citizens can be denied the right to vote at all You have citizenship how can it ever be possible for you not to be able to vote Why does it matter where you vote either Youre a citizen of the country you should be able to vote anywhere in the entire nation AND your voting day should be a national holiday We are registered  Find out where every member of Congress stands on marijuana and register to vote at wwwcannabisvoterinfo The other day I just registered to vote as I recently turned  Its exciting to finally be able to have a say in our government Regardless of your political affiliation make your voice heard Not participating in the voting process is not a solution to being unhappy with the current state of politics This is a dumb question but if I voted in the primary am I registered yep with the pop up i was able to update my registration now i can vote in my primary  How the hell so you even register  here never voted

white bitches around here I just want to remind everyone that voting is a right not a responsibility Yes sir Registered Republican Im a bit confused why do you guys have to register Isnt the US keeping track of theur citizens I have a question for you Americans why is it that you have to register to vote It seems like a bit of a hassle and a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy Where Im from if youre a citizen and  years old you can just show up and vote We get a ballot thing in the mail before the elections but I actually dont think you need to bring it anymore either NonAmerican here Do it guys go and register now I dont care who youre gonna vote for I dont even care if your only options are giant douches and turd sandwiches just register and vote for the giant douche or the turd sandwich thatll probably do things you agree with Do it Dont screw it up for the rest of us Im working on a campaign in my hometown and I spent a couple hours on Friday registering new freshman at the university here The second person I registered was a young woman from Puerto Rico She had just moved all the way to the west coast alone for college so she could earn a better future She had been looking forward to registering to vote for years We had a short conversation about PR and the other American territories being perpetually ignored and neglected but still being proud Americans and hoping one day to join the rest of us in the  I felt so lucky to be able to take part in that moment I know voting is a relatively small part in any persons life but I could tell it meant a lot to her to be able to take part in the political process Ive talked to so many people lately that are jaded cynical or hopeless about the political process in America it was a refreshing and wonderful thing to be a part of Are YOU registered I bought a house in a different county Where can I go Im an American living in Spain How can I register to vote overseas Ugh Im tired of all these national whatever days s Really Register to vote This is one of those things where youre either part of the problem or youre part of the solution Push voting and censor your opponents Thanks Reddit You Beto I am deleted Vote Please vote The trend over the last several years is to make voting more inaccessible and more difficult This is done in the guise of fighting voter fraud that while it does happen is exceptionally rare You have a voice Make it heard Serious question here my wife got American citizenship and registered to vote at an event a couple weeks ago The booth she applied at was a Republican booth Senator Heller NV After she applied I mentioned maybe stupidly that she wants to vote out Republicans The guys demeanor changed immediately but he gave her the receipt which we have Should she be worried Might the application get lost Can she reapply somewhere else Is it legal Were waiting for something in the mail but the guy was vague as to when it would get here As a nonAmerican how come the American system requires you to register before voting In Sweden and probably a lot of other countries you are automatically registered by living here or being a Swedish citizen elsewhere deleted GET OUT THERE AND VOTE Just reregistered online but this time as a Democrat It was super easy Thanks for all the links and info I hope mods across all subs take responsibility and pin this kind of post until the deadline along with a reminder to vote Its important for this to get that kind of exposure just like net neutrality I live in a real democracy so i dont need to register to vote Here is a League of Women Voters site to find out about your registration and what your candidates are thinking in their own words We are non partisan httpswwwvoteorg It doesnt matter what side your on republican or Democrat or independent  get out there get registered and vote for what you think is right your vote matters What if Reddit doesnt like who Im voting for Hi Can you explain why Reddit decided to stand by ugallowboob after he sent nudes to himself to someone who said was  Why does Reddit support this child abuser to the point that anyone who mentions it is permanently suspended Decent write up herehttpsnpredditcomrSubredditDramacommentsqwhhqgallowboobhasbeenshadowbannedcwiymn Does Reddit really think this type of behavior is acceptable among its power mods Im currently in Washington state for an internship until January but Im originally from Texas Can I still sign up to vote by mail in the upcoming November election in Texas Just double checked my whole household All registered and active Lets vote people Register to vote today Vote for politicians who support automatic voter registration in November Every day should be National Voter Registration Day Good luck voting guys Hope everything works fine and you have an influence on the future of America This is a reddit announcement Double check Lots of people are being deleted from voter rolls and are not being told Canadian here Please go register to vote Please then go vote Were sick of your shitty politicians all over the news day in and day out We dont have time for our own shitty politicians anymore Please stop your shitty politicians from setting a bad example for the rest of the world Please vote Please continue to vote I love how you guys not only refused to look into that FTheAltRight Post but you are also allowing brigading by TD users who are upvoting comments discouraging voting with contradicts the point of your post I feel like there is a word to describe you guys right now Ccked What is that missing vowel I am registered  yo and been registered since my th birthday Time to lock and load Democrats Join our efforts at rbluemidterm Yes but I have to update my voter registration so who knows how long that will take Yes I need advice Im not registered I moved away from home a little while ago and have not gotten a drivers license from my current state of residence I also lost my social security card somewhere in the move which has kept me from going to get my new license Is there any affordable way to somehow get registered without having to wait for my new social card and license Because I dont think Ill have the money to order a new card and pay license fees in time for voting I know its a dumb excuse that I should have taken care of ages ago but I felt too embarrassed at my finances to reach out and get help I have a question Not only have I married and legally changed my name but Ive moved since the last election Everything is updated on my license passport etc Do I need to go to the clerks office in advance in NH Or can I show up with proof at my polling station and register on voting day Also anyone away at college or elsewhere may be registered at home and will need to order their absentee ballots ahead of time See details herehttpswwwvoteorgabsenteeballot scroll down to see state info Registered and ready i am where i live now but im hopefully days away from getting a job offer and if i get it id probably be moved to another state before the end of october im not entirely sure what i should dowhat the process is My body is ready Reminder that in many states you can vote absentee which means you can google candidates you dont know and make an informed choice In states where you need a reason to vote absentee the cops arent gonna make sure you were actually planning to be out of area on Election Day so go ahead and check that sucker Im registered to vote absentee and signed up as a lead pollingplace volunteer for my th year I highly recommend volunteering at an election for anyone who can possibly spare the time It gives a fascinating behindthescenes look at how our elections really work is quite fun if you keep a good sense of humor about it and theres a lot of satisfaction in knowing youre doing something thats crucial to democracy I registered My college actually had representatives to get students to register and I registered in the summer but Im not quite sure how long it will be before it expires again in Ohio anyway Also checks admin username wait a minute Hey all Ive never voted or even registered I would like to do so in person or physically Even though I am not old doing things online really stresses me out What can I do to register in person Lucky me the state I live in is same day registration so I dont have to reregister when I move just let them know my address has changed and its good Nope  I live in North Dakota Were not required to jump through hoops Also we get state referendums Eyyyyy do I see Minnesota Thatsa my state Hey uLastBluejay what is Reddit doing to combat toxic fake news being propagated on the platformfalse news and claims which have been shown to have an impact on elections radicalize people on the right and lead to violence against innocent people If I moved to a new state and am trying to get registered do I have to have my drivers license match the state I moved from OR have DL there to SD and they require copy of license No because my state is awesome and doesnt require voter registration This is my first time voting because Im about to turn  Ive been doing GOTV and there are so many people who arent voting even if they are registered Id like to add how difficultif you have moved recently it can be to register I have to break from a very busy schedule and go sit at the dmv for  hours just to get everything squared away I know its probably worth it But very annoying to say the least Absolutely Two years ago when I registered to vote I received a mail for Jury service It happened again this timeMeanwhile some US citizens I know never registered to vote and didnt get any mail from Jury Service Btw Im living in California Preregistered yuh I have another question when I check on whether or not I am registered to vote I see a date thats titled Valid From  xB What does that mean Does it mean I am officially registered on the th of October or something else I say this because literally underneath that line it also states  Effective Date of Registration  So whats the deal with those dates Thank you people check your voter registration and a whole lot more at wwwvotesaveamericacomhttpvotesaveamericacom cheers In Norway you dont have to register to vote they just send you a slip automatically to vote No one on reddit is old enough to vote Whoops thanks for the reminder Reddit almost forgot to register Im sure all the right leaning candidates will appreciate my extra vote Thanks again for the heads up Yes Ive been registered and voting in EVERY election cycle since  I know it feels as if your vote doesnt count at times But your vote matters regardless You HAVE a voice  and thats what really counts The real question is why complain if you didnt vote Just vote at your local ballot  even if your municipality tries to make it difficult for you to do so That is the point  they want to try to mute you Just keep in mind that if YOU vote despite the obstacles thrown your way  youre still setting an example That resolve on your behalf easily can not inspire others into voting as you do  that WILL change the status quo Dont let them convince you otherwise Overcome the hardships they attempt to throw in your way Rome wasnt built in a day but it took a far shorter period of time to burn it all down Ive never understood this push for people to vote I really dont Ive heard it my whole life starting in high school really but its just always something that it sitting out there Get out and vote Rock the vote Make sure you register to vote xB In some places peoplegroups even organized trips where volunteers would gather up people put them on a bus drive to them either register or to actually vote Which I mean is great Im not against those things xB But nobody ever says things like Hey and also before you vote maybe spend like five minutes looking into things instead of just voting for whoever your Facebook feed says you should Even for something as big as a presidential election in the US the handful of people Ive spoken to about it before the last vote clearly didnt know much of anything about the candidates or the issues or even just some fundamental concepts around economics or things like the effectiveness of antidrug programs in schools or people who think that if they get a raise theyll make less money because they will enter the next tax bracket xB And thats at the national level They are even less informed at the local level xB Everyone who advocates voting seems to imply that if more people vote then the person they wanted to win would have won They dont get that clueless people like my friends and like myself and easy pawns for anyone bold enough to lie to us People showed up and voted for Hitler back in the day If you dont follow politics thats fine I dont follow politics But please for the love of God dont feel like you have a civic duty to blindly cast a vote because everyone says you should go vote Voting is a hugely important thing and that means every voter should be informed on the candidates the process whats at stake etcif you arent willing to invest a significant amount of time  just stay home You are just as likely to vote for a shitty candidate than a great one People literally voted for Hitler Very few that did had any idea what his legacy would become Dont vote for Hitler If you dont know politics abstain from voting Which flavor of more government did you want to vote for No Im not and frankly I dont give a fuck If you dont know anything about politics besides what rpolitics and Stephen Colbert lie to you about then stay the fuck home I am and plan to vote in November I did when I turned  Pretty easy to do Its like one page of paper Took me less than ten minutes to fill out Vote blue this November The idea that you have to register is so dumb In any normal civilized country you just come on the voting day and vote thats it Man there are a lot of TD cases in this thread When are you people going to do something about the Russian attacks on Reddit and the calls to violence on thedonald You are complicit at this point and straight up TRAITORS bipartisan rpolitics Lol Yes I am and Im voting to get Ted Cruz out of office deleted Where do you see reddit in  years Am I hallucinating I run unenhanced reddit at work and now when I expand a post on the front page the top threeish comments are showed along with the content Stealth added feature deleted Can you sort out the front page so breaking news gets there quicker Also so a third of my front page isnt the same as when I went to sleep  hours earlier  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address We pushed back on the request and our lawyer who knows how to turn a phrase opposed the petitionAfter seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely signaling our victory All my friends are admins take it slow Why is google providing mreddit results instead of regular reddit in search results on desktop Its kind of annoying What celebratory festivities do you admins have planned for us on November th Soooo No more gay dating site ads Are there any plans currently to introduce tiers of NSFW tagging For example subs like rImGoingToHellForThis auto tag everything NSFW by default due to the nature of the content which means that if theres porn gore or otherwise unless the user specifies it in the title that warning is kind of lost due to the auto tag Is there any possibility or plans to provide separate tags for NSFL or porn content separate to the type of warning that rImGoingToHellForThis provides On another note thankyou for the work on the spoiler tags it is very much appreciated from all users deleted Why sometimes your answer is tagged red and sometimes blue deleted How will the advertisement targeting translate to mobile applications such as BaconReader Is it automatically integrated or possible to optout of for developers But seriously can you have the mreddit people show ireddit some love Or at least make reddittoreddit links keep me on ireddit and not send me to mreddit Mobile is still encountering many issues that were present since the beginning of the mobile site  such as pictures being loaded with a play button over them failing the load the image and displaying image not found and displaying an album a few inches to the right so that it is impossible to progress through the album without going to posted link etc Are these issues being worked on Or are they back burner to larger issues Also so that this comment isnt exclusively complaints I really appreciate the faster load times and the new comment interface It fixed many the issues I had trying to press the right button quickly And the animation for upvoting and downvoting pretty nice Thanks Edit a couple of typos slipped past me whoops deleted Not sure if uspez is actually funny or PR person Do you have any comment on exCEO uYishans commentshttpswwwredditcomrTheoryOfRedditcommentszahotheaccuracyofvoatregardingredditsrsadmins about the recent administrative history of Reddit Why are you the CEO of Reddit deleted Hey spez Is there any additional focus being given by your poor team about the issue of catching spam A lot of spam is reported and some of them somehow stay up especially if they have no submission history and all their spam is exclusively comment spam Why are you the way that you are Thank you Why does Reddit now use outredditcom to redirect a user to a link when it always used to link straight to the content If we have feedback towards specific Admins being awesome usodypop and uredtaboo is there a better place to let you know than here  edit we all know what this edit is for thank you THIS ANGERS US GREATLY Thank you so much for the spoiler feature We can finally stop marking everything nsfw Do you ever browse reddit while sitting on the toilet like we do Who are you voting for For those of you who dont speak legalese You have to make a claim against an actual person and not an anonymous entity I just wanted to say that I really enjoy this site Thank you and the team at Reddit for all the hard work you put into it and enhancing my internet experience for more than three years What kind of dog do you like You say you are improving adverts but the only adverts I ever see these days and I dont use adblock either at the top or sidebar are for subreddits and the very occasional advert for something only available to US customers im in the EU or something very dubious Just as a test I opened the front page  times and all the sidebar ads are for subreddits and only one highlighted post at the top was actually an advert for something the rest were suggested posts Im struggling to understand where your ad revenue comes from How come my subreddit got a message about both the beta for new modmail AND the sidebar expansion and both times neither of them have happened Can I have a job in a few years D Hey uspez  Back again with one of your favorite questions to dodge Your dodge game has been going strong for  years on this one so Im giving you another opportunity to zig zag like Rickon should have Do you mind answering this questionhttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentscljiwheredidmypostaboutsearscomsurlhackableccimcontext now You told us to check back with you in a few months I think  years is sufficient time Here is the History for those that dont remember the glorious Fuck Sears IncidenthttpswwwredditcomrTheBookofRedditcommentshpmihistorythefucksearsfiasco This is even more relevant now that you are developing advertiser targeting methods What happens when an advertiser doesnt like a certain post or the attitude of a subreddit concerning their product Can they pull a Sears and force you guys to remove it and not explain for six years and counting When is the official reddit app coming to ipad Hey spez serious question and something that has been a big issue for us on rAskReddit that we still keep getting very vague responses on but what do you plan on doing to help us combat the waves of sockpuppet accounts that steal content from older posts in order to build karma to sell the account to spammers The rise of these has been incredibly frustrating and we havent had much help In fact you guys making self posts give karma has only made the problem even worse for us because now we are resorting to pulling posts made by these spammers stifling the discussion that was going on because its the only way we can really fight these You probably wont respond to this but its seriously fucking annoying to keep trying to tell you guys that this is a big big problem that is causing a lot of work not just for us but for mods all across the site We maintain these communities that keep your site afloat because we care about them and it would be nice if you guys acted like you cared about us enough to listen and try to work with us AS A HUMAN I AM CONCERNED BY THE MISTREATMENT OF BOTS ON REDDIT BECAUSE I AM A HUMAN THAT CARES ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND NOT A ROBOT Is anything being done about mobile users having to switch mobile Reddit to desktop mode multiple times a day I like the mobile version but Im just resistant to change and I feel like the site REALLY wants me to see the content in mobile format What are you going to do about the socalled Super Mods who control multiple highvolume subreddits either through one or multiple accounts operated by the same individuals It is clear to many of us redditors who have been here a long time I have a much older account than this one that there is an abusive system in place and I personally suspect nothing is being done about it because the admin team prefers to have a smaller number of moderators because its just easier to work with I think that needs to change because reddit will go the way of digg if the control of content lies with too few people What about the idea of requiring an identity verification for all moderators of subreddits above a certain size And limiting any one individual to moderating  default subreddit  major nondefault subs and  minor nondefault subs I feel thats more than fair At the very least it will result in better moderation of any given subreddit as the mods will have more time to devote to each one Please note this has been brought up before For years actually And theres an additional benefit to enacting such a policy Not only would it improve reddit users experiences and cut down on biased post deletion in major subreddits but it would also get a lot of redditors off your back about shit like Correct The Record CTR as Im sure youre aware posted on their own site that they were investing heavily in ways to control information on reddit We all know we can sell our accounts for cash so of course we suspect that a good number of moderator positions have been compromised for a tidy sum of shut up money because reddit is second only to Facebook in terms of disseminating information to the public Whether or not theyve actually taken over reddit is another thing entirely The fact is that enough people THINK thats the case that Im sure its causing you headaches Well theres only one way I can think of to handle that headache that would make everyone happy except the mods And frankly the mods can go to hell if they think they dont owe the community some sort of verification that they arent selling or abusing their mod powers Ah actually I did have a question When are we mods getting the antibrigading tools that was promised httpswwwredditcomrModSupportcommentstplawherearethepromisedantibrigadingtools Does the ad change affect mobile users as well or is that still up to the individual app we use Whats your favorite mixed drink I bet youre a briefs man or maybe you freeball it Do they even make you wear anything at all as CEO deleted   What is thishttpspastebincomGuViF Ive entirely stopped browsing Reddit on my phone because the interface is practically unusable to me It may be faster now but I no longer visit the site if my phone is the only option I have at the time Is there any way to bypass mobile view and see desktop view instead  horse sized redditor or  duck sized redditors OK fucking awesome title But optingout really should be by account as well On the optout mechanism being per browser If Im reading this correctly I havent actually looked for myself yet you set a cookie saying this browser doesnt want personalized ads This is a bad thing for some of us as we may have the browser set to clear cookies after each tab is closed Ill have to go find that button and opt out again every time I restart the browserreopen the tab Could we also have a peraccount setting serverside somewhere Why cant I filter a subreddit even when I am on rall It annoys me to refresh the new or even rising and see um a certain cretinous subreddit in every post and I dont mean radviceanimals Politically neutral I did notice it is much faster on the mobile site Why is httpswwwredditcomrallrising filled with  content from a single sub It either seems like brigading or that your algorithm isnt working deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk deleted Seeing as reddit isnt a fan of vote manipulation and has had previous users banned for such things what preventative measures are in place to prevent both Correct the Record and TheDonald brigades from skewing votes on posts How big of a problem is this Is it even considered a problem by the reddit team I know nothing of what reddit does to protect its vote integrity and would love to have some light shed on this subject WHAT THE HELL IS WITH ALL Have you guys done any looking into the claims of governments  political groups paying people to influence users This seems to be something that everyone can agree on being bad though one side would probably point to something like CTR while the other would point to something like Putin bots Seems like a lot of the effect is likely just exaggerated and has more to do with how the upvote system can lead to the appearance of really large swings in opinion when they are in fact not as big if an issue is divisive Still seems worth looking into though Would it even be possible to tell if this sort of activity is happening Do you enjoy deodorant Hi Steve my names Michael Thanks for keeping reddit not bankrupt Feature Request Can we get an optout of targeted ads at the account level instead of browser level I clear my cookies pretty often and would have to optout at least daily which would get annoying So Ill end up having to block all ads instead Right now I allow ads on Reddit in my ad blocker Thanks Under Article   the link tax  online services are banned from allowing links to news services on their platforms unless they get a license to make links to the news the rule does not define news service or link leaving  member states to make up their own definitions and leaving it to everyone else to comply with  different rules Under Article   the censorship machines  anyone who allows users to communicate in public by posting audio video stills code or anything that might be copyrighted  must send those posts to a copyright enforcement algorithm The algorithm will compare it to all the known copyrighted works anyone can add anything to the algorithms database and censor it if it seems to be a match These extreme unworkable proposals represent a grave danger to the Internet The link tax means that only the largest bestfunded companies will be able to offer a public space where the news can be discussed and debated The censorship machines are a gift to every petty censor and troll just claim copyright in an embarrassing recording and watch as it disappears from the Internet and will add hundreds of millions to the cost of operating an online platform guaranteeing that Big Techs biggest winners will never face serious competition and will rule the Internet forever httpswwwefforgdeeplinkswhywholeworldshouldbearmsabouteusloominginternetcatastrophe For anyone still wondering whether this is a big deal yes its a big dealhttpswwwredditcomrOutOfTheLoopcommentsprxdswhydopeoplekeepsayingthattheeuarebanningeeywmh No one really gives a shit about their MEPs in a lot of European countries and thats why its relatively easy for them to slip this kind of nonsense through French redditors especially should contact their MEPs  French MEPs voted in favour of the bill in July with only eight voting againsthttpswwwsiliconrepubliccomenterpriseeucopyrightvotemeps You represent the greatest opportunity for us to tip the balance Vive la rsistance They targeted memers Memers Were a group of people who will sit for hours days even weeks on end performing some of the stupidest most mentally demeaning photoshops Over and over and over all for nothing more than a little digital karma saying we did Well punish ourselves memeing things others would consider unfunny because we think its fun Well spend most if not all of our free time memeing the formats of established characters and celbrities all to draw out a single extra point of karma per second Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things slogging through reddit all day the same reposts over and over hundreds of times to the point where we know every little detail such that some have attained such memer nirvana that they can literally make these memes blindfolded Do these people have any idea how many keyboards have been smashed CPUs over heated GIMP and PAINT destroyed in frustration All to latter be referred to as bragging rights These EU politicians honestly think this is a battle they can win They take our media Were already building a new one without them They take our Fair Use Memers arent shy about throwing their VPNs else where or even making the sites our selves They think calling us unfunny manbabby Prequel memers is going to change us Weve been called worse things by prepubescent  year olds with a youtube account They picked a fight against a group thats already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods Who enjoy the battle of attrition theyve threatened us with Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter Our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brotherssisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need a honed reflex Memers are competative hard core by nature We love a challange The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us Youre not special youre not original youre not the first this is just another pasta fight One big thing to note is that even if you are outside the EU you will probably still be affected Many of the companies you deal with on the daily are multinational companies They serve people from around the world In many cases it would be too impracticaltime consumingexensive to create a system that would filter content solely from one location So its likely that users from non european countries will feel the impact in one way or another We have an updated EU Copyright Megathreadhttpswwwredditcomreuropecommentselubontheeucopyrightreformivsecond on reurope about it if anyone wants to check it out French Redditors especially step up your game  of your MEPs voted in favour in July with only eight againsthttpswwwsiliconrepubliccomenterpriseeucopyrightvotemeps As far as I can tell youre the country with the greatest ability to shift the vote in our favour Vive la rsistance Upload Filter are a threat not only to a person but to companies where else can they get the software from other than Google Amazon NSA or Facebook lets help the big tech companies they need it And dont worry if they block you they will not be punished If you live in the UK you can use this website to contact your MEPs httpswwwmysocietyorgwehelpyoucontactyourmeps Is anyone else aware of australias government proposing a bill that allows them to bypass all privacy protections Essentially what is called Ass Access will allow the australian government to without a warrant spy on everything everywhere and not just in australia but everywhere else too Just about everyone with a website as well as companies will have to implement a backdoor to make services less secure or else be forced to pay up to TEN MILLION DOLLARS Oh my lord Why are legislators always trying to kill the internet These are the kind of regulations that are actually bad for consumers because all they do is punish people for using the internet asis Platforms must honour how and whether news sites want their articles to be displayed according to the Robotstxt protocol Thats a very very interesting and fair way to deal with the entire link tax idea which requires companies like Google or even Reddit and very small focused aggregators to pay a tax to anyone whose news they link to Is a corporate public relations announcement news Is a direct link to a public figures Twitter or Facebook account news Who cares It doesnt matter If you want to get paid for someone to link to your stuff you have to say that in your Robotstxt file Of course once you do say that Google and Bing are probably going to stop listing your content that same day Have fun watching your searchbased traffic drop off a cliff deleted If we lose you can connect to the Tor network using their browser available at httpswwwtorprojectorg and bypass the filters PP file sharing BitTorrent etc will be great for sharing memes if they put these fucking filters in So give it to us straightis this going to kill rprequelmemes Because if so we need to let all the lawmakers in the EU know And not just the Parliament but the Parliawoment and the Parliachildrent too I contacted every MEP in Belgium So far I have received reply from  stating they outright reject article  Its a good start but we need everyone on this Ah fuck this again I dont even know what I expected at this point c Im not from Europe not from the US either but for those who are Im really really sorry Ive been getting targeted ads on twitter telling me to support article  first off Im american and dont get a say secondly fuck off How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man Fuck uSpez If Ive learned anything from US politics its this Ram it through again and again and again It doesnt matter how long it takes Do it until it passes As someone who is not from Europe and therefore does not have an MEP to contactvote out what should I be doing to defeat this FUCK Please stop with the meme narrative these rules affect lots of other things and the meme stuff just makes it easy to dismiss opposition as angry yos no offense pewds Youd think theyd have learned by now that the only way to succeed in this is by being like AjitbPai ignore the people and make the vote unrepresentative of their opinions OUR MEMES WILL BLOT OUT THE SUN This is not about memes Stop fucking making it seem like its just about memes Damn really After all of EUs censorship bullshit I forget why theyre doing this in the first place Why do they need to censor the internet when there are a hundred worse issues they could be addressing How is Reddit going to follow these rules This whole damn site is built around sharing news and memes Fucking damn it I just dont understand why anyone would want this Who benefits Well It was nice knowing you people I wont be seeing you anymore Here we go again That is definitely bigger than the last one This is so stupid Why does the world ruin everything I enjoy we are fucked For all the Europeans who told us to go deal with our politicians with regards to SOPA PIPA and NN now is the time for action on your side of the pond Euro SOPA Misguided censorship to take away stuff like porn or is this something else entirely Anytime the rest of you want to stop pretending that copyright laws were ever a good idea Im up for it When Net Neutrality debacle rolled out in the US I commented that if it wasnt shot down similar legislation would be written around the world I was downvoted to oblivion Well Articles  and  were passed RIP memes Alright Meme Marines its time for Operation YEET I hope  though I doubt  these people voting are fully informed about the ramifications of what theyre voting on Its times like this where I realize it doesnt even matter that we Norwegians decided to stay out of the European Union Everything they do and decide affects us anyway Why this again they passed it bois When will we kmow about Reddits changes following this law protect the memes only the ones we like though not MDE Just when I thought Brexit was a mistake This is the war of our generation and we will not go quietly resulting in a machinecensored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet Yeah who in their right minds would want something like an automoderator censoring users and comments based on a list of generalised filters Oh wait I never truly understood this Memes count as transformative surely Brexit has never made more sense given this bullshit In the event this passes does Reddit have something in place to start filtering content or would it have to block traffic from Europe Could someone please explain this in simpler terms please At least we have Brexit First net neutrality and now this Fuck sakes Very proud of Poland and Sweden for being almost entirely against this All  Swedish MEPs  of which I contacted were against art I have no fucking clue with what the fuck France is doing though Is article  even legal with GDPR in effect Thought that prohibited automated machines doing copyright takedown shenanigans American here If I VPN into Europe will the bots of annihilation target me Is there anything Swiss citizens can do Were not part of the EU but we are stuck right in the middle and we have a lot of agreements with the EU well shit Our memes will forever be untarnished I emailed every MEP in Britain about this disgusting law and only Nigel Farage responded httpsiimgurcombVaMUBpng Ooooh do the American Redditors get to be all fucking smug now like the European Redditors were during the Net Neutrality debacle here Youre fighting against censorship Wasnt the last announcement literally about you censoring a bunch of accounts posting articles from reputable news sources Eu  Ok we have real problems to solve We should ban memes Post this message to groups like Discord server that you are part of I urge everyone to go to httpssaveyourinterneteu and mail your representatives about this issue Also be sure to spread this news to all of your friends especially those in France Copy this message and put it in the announcements of any servers to which you have access to the announcement channel We will fight For the memes Reddit only opposes censorship when its proposed to be achieved by targeting their pocketbook YOU GOT A LOICENSE TO POST THAT LINK BRUV My fear is a lot of the meps that votes against it could have been bought I find it highly unreasonable to believe everyone votes based on the goodness of their hearts deleted I find it interesting that this is such a heated topic among reddit admins especially under the guise of open internet yet reddit has a history of censorship and using its own resources to generate its own content filter albeit not from a copyright sense The New Yorker quotes you as saying  My internal check when Im arguing for a restrictive policy on the site is Do I sound like an Arab government If so maybe I should scale it back Why is that a good threshold This is like defending Trump by saying hes not quite as bad as Hitler so everything must be peachy Reddits approach to policy used to be  We stand for free speech This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it Not because thats the law in the United States  because as many people have pointed out privatelyowned forums are under no obligation to uphold it  but because we believe in that ideal independently and thats what we want to promote on our platform We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasnt clear and to be honest in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit Now its just reddit and we serve the community we serve the ideals of free speech and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse Why have you deliberately weakened and continue to water down this stance becoming something closer to the Arab governments you describe Edit  Our protip if you will is to always engage with the community espescially on the tricky issues    You Buna Thanks for this Also shared with my friends Wtf is France doing So sad that so many European politicians want to censor the Internet we really do need to be fighting back against this Its like turnitin for copyright What now How do we come back from this How do we fix this Who needs an attempt from the EU when the reddit admins are busy doing it themselves This might be a good time to take your freedom back Silencing citizenry is the death of freedom and liberty Laughable The internet is our true last freedom and it is beyond control Well use VPNs to bypass locationbased blocking well use PP file sharing dark web if things go too far It cannot be stopped This reminds me of DRM on games It doesnt help copyright infringement it just hinders the average consumer The rest of us will find a way to go about our business unscathed Reddit cares about censorship now Thats cool Oh ffs I thought Id filtered out this bullshit seudo you the public have the power Fuck off As if any of you give a fuck about an open internet Youre fine with censorship as long as its of the other side Bitches about censorship Bans people they disagree with You know what yall can get fucked for all I care Another corporation here to tell us what political beliefs we should hold I wonder which people that are usually against this sort of thing are suddenly going to praise and defend this How can other countries help out with this After the bullshit with net neutrality here in the states I dont want any other countries having any similar issues Thank you for building awareness As an European I greatly appreciate it And the guys from saveyourinterneteu are just great wonderful tool I hate copyright rcopyleft Quick question why ban MDE Can someone explain to me again why its a bad thing for creators to own their own copyright Why Reddit plays the white knight but usurps the rights to any image uploaded to it Read their TCs Or why no one questions Reddits business model Not saying the new copyright regulations are right or even the way to go just saying that Reddit is looking out for its profit margins not your rights In fact the Reddit business model works better the LESS rights the creator has Germany already censors its internet Reddit just cares about ad clicks Redditors were gleeful about Jones being banned and plenty of them want td off the site Start being vigorously pro free speech or stuff like this will happen Stop sucking off private companies because they seem to agree with you politically Reddit not even a day after posting this just banned rmilliondollarextreme a meme sub focused on a tv show with some political leanings You sir are a hypocrite of the highest order and I hope the EU succeeds in crippling your business model You have proven to me a hardcore anarchocapitalist that providing platforms for public discussion and discourse should not be left to profit seeking entities I used to love this site but because of the policy changes you and others have pushed for here I actively hope you fail Reddit does not deserve the title of front page of the internet when your administration of the site more closely resembles China than the country you operate in To protect against this sort of government interference in addition to your own censorship bullshit it is necessary for us to advance beyond centrally administered corporate social media Excuse me we arent back from vacation We didnt go on vacation None of us have any money Which is ironic because Im from the UK and were about to have less than nothingyay us Why should any of us shill for you This is the dark side of Reddit How can you justify getting us to basically brigade politicians and not see how dangerous that mentality actually is Hive mind  anon groupthink dictating government bills through mobbing is a recipe for an unmitigated disaster This is a self serving attempt to save itself from their control of the internet via content aggregation and Im not sure Reddit admins should be the arbiter of what is just and fair regarding our internet usage Im sure this comment will get buried anyway but I hope you see it and respond Do you ever wonder why anytime admins make an announcement post that they set it to sort by QA It is so that they can hide the comments they dont like  dont want to respond to by just ignoring them and then meme with each other in the favorable comments to boost those worried about Netizens losing free speech Yeah block Alex Jones from the entire internet anytime a country or organization is attempting to censor you its bad I dont think I can get involved in this in any helpful way besides upvoting Im in America but I hope this goes well because it will impact the whole world Serious question since Reddit is hosted in the US cant it just say fuck you EU lawmakers we arent under your jurisdiction They would have to block off VPNs to have any desired censorship effect on Reddit Although this anti meme stupidity is bad what is even worse is the rumored threat of putting in a law that would essentially ban you from carrying your laptop across the border into the EU if you have EVER USED IT for any pirate downloading even stream ripping COPYRIGHTED music into mp from YouTube is technically illegalpiracy but EVERYONE DOES IT MEMES ARE STAYING HOME EVERYONE Member when Reddit censored rthedonald from the front page spez we are talking about censoring memes right Oh fuck not again Yay EU Is this the end of Stack Overflow What does this mean for people living in america These old jaded politicians really dont understand the Internet This Is Terrible  Invest in all Mr Stark i dont feel so good stuff made for every meme ever Does anyone know the likelihood of it passing Will it be close Do us UK redditors have to call up too Or how about Europe just fucks off completely from trying to regulate the internet Yeah I like that idea  all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans This is just a blatant lie You use programmatic ads both on the website and in your mobile apps Users are constantly making posts about ads that shouldnt have been shown  gigantic ads ones with autoplaying videosound even malware and redirects sometimes The admins that reply to these posts make it clear that they dont even know what ads are running and need the user to capture data about the ad for them to be able to do anything about the bad ones Spez Im reposting this because I received no response from you after a month to my other submissionhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsuzpinotmyfirstcouldbemylaststateofthedthhp and I have now yet again been waiting nearly    hours for an admin to get back to me about yet another user who encouraged one of our community members to attempt suicide on Sunday Hi Spez Im a clinical psychologist and for the past six years Ive been the mod of a subreddit for people with borderline personality disorder rBPD BPD has among the highest rates of completed suicide of any psychiatric disorder and approximately  of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point Given this out of our nearly  subscribers we are likely to be having dozens of users attempting suicide every week In particular the users who are most active on our sub are often very symptomatic and desperate and we very frequently get posts from actively suicidal users Im telling you this because over the years I have felt very unsupported by the Reddit admins in one particular area As you know there are unfortunately a lot of very disturbed people on Reddit Some of these people want to hurt others As a result I often encounter users who goad on our suicidal community members to kill themselves This is a big problem Of course encouraging any suicidal person to kill themselves is a big deal but people with BPD in particular are prone to impulsivity and are highly susceptible to abusive behavior This makes them more likely to act on these malicious suggestions When I encounter these users I immediately contact the admins Although I can ban them and remove their posts I cannot stop them from sending PMs and creating new accounts to continue encouraging suicide Instead I need you guys to step in and take more direct action The problem Im having is that it sometimes take more than  full days before anything is done by the admins In the meantime I see the offending users continue to be active on Reddit and sometimes continuing to encourage suicide Over the years Ive asked you guys how we can ensure that these situations are dealt with immediately or at least more promptly than  days later and Ive gotten nothing from you As a psychologist who works primarily with personality disorders and suicidal patients I can assure you that someone is going to attempt suicide because of a situation like this if it hasnt happened already We both myself and Reddit need to figure out a better way to handle this Please tell me what we can do Im very eager to work with you guys on this Thank you Edit It is shameful that three days have now passed since I contacted the admins about this most recent suicideencouraging user I have sent three PMs to the general admin line one directly to uSpez and two directly to another mod There is no excuse for this If anyone out there is in a position that allows them to more directly access the admins I would appreciate any help I can get in drawing their attention to this Thank you Weve tried nothing and are out of ideas TLDR We know youre concerned Were not going to do anything about it How can we the community trust you to take any kind of substantive action at all when weve been calling for it time and time again and have been ignored rPCMasterRace was banned for apparent brigading and was only reinstated after strict antibrigading rules were put in place Meanwhile people in rTheDonald openly called for bridgadinghttpsimgurcomDLoj rMinnesota in order to swing its election The user who proposed it even got caught brigading the thread calling them out for ithttpsiimgurcompDeGinpng TheDonald remains active the users account remains active and their comment is still in place I just checked Moderators didnt do jack about it when it was reported meanwhile the users reveled in their success for the next eleven hourshttpsiimgurcomohjWOPdpng rMinnesota now has a flood of people who come out of the woodwork only for posts pertaining to elections or national politics and they seem to be disproportionately in favor of Trump I once had my account permanently suspended because I posted publicly available WHOIS information that supported my claim that the three day old website was part of a massive Macedonian fake news phenomenonhttpwwwbbccomnewsmagazine I very carefully worded my post to make it clear that this wasnt an indictment of the user who posted it because of the possibility this was indirect propaganda instance It took me about a week for my appeal to be heard and my suspension commuted Theres a user who pushes vile hate speech about immigrants and Muslims as bad as the kind of stuff that went on in rCoonTown calling them all rapists and pedophiles yet their account remains active Same user organized harassment of David Hogg a seventeen year old kid claiming that if he met him hed beat him up Same user also posted content from vPizzagate promoting how real it is including tons of the same kind of witchhunty kind of vague mumbo jumbo evidence that was used in rPizzagate which was so toxic it had to be banned That user is still active today and dont say its because you didnt know because I filed a formal report and got an acknowledgment from another admin And dont say its because the moderators took action because when the moderators took action against my WHOIS comment you still felt the need to come after my account days after the fact And I can say for a fact that the moderators wouldnt take action because said user is a moderator in the subreddits where theyre posting this content What is your explanation for this I post publicly available information and get the banhammer this user spews vile stuff and organizes harassment and witch hunts the likes of which got whole subreddits banned but theyre left alone If you did reach out to them clearly you had little impact because that content is still up on their account and theyre still posting stuff just like it now So how can we trust that youll actually take action against these kinds of communities and people Because so far all Ive seen is evidence of a double standard when it comes to the application of the content policy deleted Yeah well you can start fixing reddits integrity For example fix the modsituation at rcanada Author of ualternatesourcebot here  I think theres room to fight disinformation algorithmically by at least putting in some effort to pop filter bubbles This reporthttpsshorensteincenterorginformationdisorderframeworkforresearchandpolicymaking from Harvards Shorenstein Center supports this idea  Work on solutions specifically aimed at minimising the impact of filter bubbles   Let users customize feed and search algorithms   Diversify exposure to different people and views   Allow users to consume information privately   Change the terminology used by the social networks The bot looks like its fairly popular based on its karma and goodbotbadbot rating but at this point I dont have any measures of how well its changing peoples minds Unfortunately because it is just another userbot it has been banned from some of the subs that might need it the most A lot of words were used but very little was said Most of this has been said and discussed in many a thread before This post is completely reactionary due to recent articles in the news This type of post is better for your media relations not the users Youve told us nothing about the current atmosphere Why you will ban certain havens but not others This post is anything but transparent Its basically yeah yeah shits happening please dont leave us because were not doing anything about it we are cooperating with congressional inquiries Youre saying there are countermeasures being investigated Welp thats a relief In any halfway politicized sub theres a high frequency of extremism from weekold accounts making it tiresome to sift through the twisted narrative From time to time some people also reference an apparent purge of mods from some subs just before the last election so there seems to be a level of apathy and possiblyparanoid thinking that the mods wont do shit even if you report the trolls Were there any subreddit moderators in those few hundred accounts you banned deleted Why arent you doing more to stop reddit from being used as a platform to advocate violence People are being radicalized and then acting on that radicalization Just ban the subs and the users that permit such tactics Dont let the users or the mods of the subs with those users get away with it We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously Now that is the funniest joke Ive read this year TLDR We are not banning TD so stop asking us to For those of you who care enough to actually want to help clean up the site since uspez and the rest of the admins cant be bothered to get off their asses and do the what they should have been doing years ago here are some helpful tips to make use of  If you find a post or comment that is violently racist xenophobic homophobic antiSemitic etc archive the permalink using archiveishttparchiveis immediately and bookmark it  Take a screenshot of an ad next to that content  Tweet the screenshots to the company with a polite nonoffensive note to notify them of the placement Or as an alternative contact the company in question via their contact us page Search around the companys website to see if they have a dedicated contact us form for ads and send them an email with the screenshots of the content their ad is placed next to  Make sure to tweet out your findings to news media outlets as well uwashingtonpost not sure who handles the account has an account here and recently a report was publishedhttpswwwwashingtonpostcombusinesseconomywestudiedthousandsofanonymouspostsabouttheparklandattackandfoundaconspiracyinthemakingabebebdefcstoryhtmlutmtermfcfdeb a report regarding communities like TD creating nutty conspiracies about the Parkland shooting So there are some outlets already monitoring what goes on there but it wouldnt help to spread the word a bit further to interested parties in the media Reporting anything TD and its users does to the admins is a fools errand at this point as they have shown as usual for years they will not bring the hammer down on problematic a colossal understatement when it comes to TD subreddits until Reddit starts getting bad press for it as a result If the admins and uspez cant be bothered to clean up the river of shit that flows from the sewers of this site on their own people are just going to have to hit them where its going to hurt their wallets EDIT Added an additional step in regards to getting more exposure in the media about the admins typical inaction Hope youre taking some notes today uwashingtonpost EDIT  One more thing I forgot to mention but join subreddits such as rstopadvertising rsleepinggiants and ragainsthatesubreddits EDIT  Guys I appreciate the thought but do not give me gold for this post Giving gold to users just continues to financially support the site And before anyone calls me a hypocrite since its obvious I already have it I was only given it a few years back when the site moved from the Alien Blue mobile app to the current one it uses It was only given to those who paid for the full version of the app which is why I have it So I see you are carrying on the Reddit Tradition of only taking action after the media notices a problem Is there any chance this will change in the future Here is a comment from  years agohttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfpdaxtimetotalkckbgav outlining this exact problem Nothing seems to have changed Some advice about something you could do Seeing as the russian propaganda has been actively promoting white suprmacism and extremist ethnostatist neo nationalists maybe you could look at removing all of the openly nazi subreddits that seem to get ignored by the admins If you dont give the russians a gaping festering wound that they can stick their fingers in to enlarge it will be harder for them to do anything It should be added that there has been a study that shows banning shithole subs workshttpsgizmodocomstudyfindsbanningredditsbigotedjerkwardsworked Edit if you are tired of looking at the various shitholes being cited in all of these comment threads I recommend checking out rcats one of the few actually good subreddits How can we as a community more effectively identify and remove the propaganda when it is reposted by Americans How can we increase awareness and more effectively watch for it Ive been advocating for a while for an optional algorithmic change that I think would help prevent this First the problem Sociologists and computer modelers have shown for a while that any time the popularity of a thing depends on the pileon effect  where people vote for something because other people have already voted for it  then  the outcomes depend very much on luck and  the outcomes are vulnerable to gaming the system by having friendssockpuppet accounts vote for a new piece of content to get the momentum going Most people who post a lot have had similar experiences to mine where you post  pieces of content that are all about the same level of quality but one of them goes viral and gets tens of thousands of upvotes while the others fizzle out That luck factor doesnt matter much for frivolous content like jokes and GIFs and some people consider it part of the fun But it matters when youre trying to sort serious content An example of this happened when someone posted a factually incorrect comment that went wildly viral claiming that John McCain had strategically sabotaged the GOP with his health care vote httpswwwredditcomrTheoryOfRedditcommentstrfvviralincorrectpoliticalpostgetsupvotes This post went so viral that it crossed over into mainstream media coverage  unfortunately all the coverage was about how a wildly popular Reddit comment got the facts wrong Several people posted factually correct rebuttals underneath that comment But none of them went viral the way the original comment did What happened simply is that because of the randomness induced by the pileon effect the original poster got extremely lucky but the people posting the rebuttals did not And this kind of thing is expected to happen as long as there is so much randomness in the outcome If the system is vulnerable to people posting factually wrong information by accident then of course its going to be vulnerable to Russian trolls and others posting factually wrong information on purpose So heres what Ive been suggesting  when a new post is made release it first to a small random subset of the target audience  the random subset votes or otherwise rates the content independently of each other without being able to see each others votes  the votes of that initial random subset are tabulated and that becomes the score for that content This sounds simple but it eliminates the pileon effect and takes out most of the luck The initial score for the content really will be the merit of that content in the opinion of a representative random sample of the target audience And you cant game the system by recruiting your friends or sockpuppets to go and vote for your content because the system chooses the voters You could game the system if you recruit so many friends and sockpuppets that they comprise a significant percentage of the entire target audience but lets assume thats infeasible for a large subreddit If this system had been in place when the John McCain comment was posted theres a good chance that it would have gotten upvotes from the initial random sample because it sounds interesting and is not obviously wrong But by the same token the rebuttals pointing out the error also would have gotten a high rating from the random sample voters and so once the rebuttals started appearing prominently underneath the original comment the comment would have stopped getting so many upvotes before it went wildly viral This can similarly be used to stop blatant hoaxes in their tracks First the randomsamplevoting system means that people gaming the system cant use sockpuppet accounts to boost a hoax post and give it initial momentum But even if a hoax post does become popular users can post a rebuttal based on a reliable source and if a representative random sample of reddit users recognizes that the rebuttal is valid theyll vote it to the top as well Hey spez you dont know me but some redditors on rpolitics probably do Ive been posting pretty detailed comments about Russia and Trump for quite a while now and have also been pretty vocal about you actually doing a proper job dealing with TD and other subs that not only seem to be a hotbed for misinformation and Russianpropaganda but that also lead to radicalization of people on those boards TD and Russia So first lets chat about TD from the Russia side of things They heavily promote Russian propaganda on your platform yet you seem to not view that as a problem because they arent Russian Pretending like there arent objective facts like you are in your OP isnt an answer there If someone wants to constantly publish info from say TenGOP or similarly Russianbased disinformation sources they should be banned Flat out If your platform is being used to influence elections by bad actors with stolen information or flat out disinformation no matter where they are from that should not be allowed There were over  posts on TD linked to or promoting IRA accountshttpswwwredditcomuserfkagncommentseestredditsubmissionslinkingtotwitterrussian And IRA is not the sum total of Russian interference This doesnt include ANY of the hacks or any other promotion of RU backed accounts And this is just what one user found And yet you keep TD open despite all of that you ignore subs like hillaryforprison wikileaks dncleaks as all of those are still up from during the electionor before Despite again constantly pushing material Russians wanted Americans to see to influence the election And if you DID find users from Russia you should make those users public and you should make where they posted public Dont delete their accounts and hide their posts just lock them and post them as clear as day so people know what was going on Label them as Russian interference Label posts from Wikileaks and DNC leaks and sharing of IRA accounts as Russian interference Tell users who interacted with these posts or posted in threads that they promoted that they were subject to interference and link them to it Which means yes youd obviously need to tell every single user of TD and likely tons of people from worldnews or politics or other political subs You should have a clear list of what was pushed by who and where For all of reddit to see What does it take for you guys to actually do something Ive barely looked into RU interference on TD and I guarantee you I could find countless examples of it not only showing up but being heavily upvoted ESPECIALLY in regards to Russian leaks or Seth Rich Farright radicalization And for the lessRussian side of things TD and lots of other subs Id happily list promote dangerous levels of conspiracy and radicalization but that is once again ignored You let pizzagate be created by this same bunch but that got removed after a guy shot up a pizza shop over it Meanwhile TD still to this day has posts and users promoting the Seth Rich conspiracy You have subs for QAnon popping up that are promoting deep conspiracies along those same lines rconspiracy basically turned into a separate td sub promoting Clinton conspiracies but thats not a problem you do anything about And you can literally watch users travel between these farright conspiracy promoting subs I know because I have them all tagged Anytime a new one pops up half the users or more end up being from TD Not to mention the constant rulebreaking that happens TD is just a hotbed of racism and other rulebreaking nonsense and users bring it up CONSTANTLY and yet again its ignored You can literally look at a thread from yesterday where every TD user in the thread was comparing themselves to persecuted jews in Nazi germany for people tagging them with RES httpswwwredditcomrTheDonaldcommentspdcjredditoraskingforawatermarktoidentifytd There have been stories of a Td user killing his father after his father called him out on his conspiracies the kid from the most recent school shooting seemed to fit right into this same bunch a young white farright kid who got radicalized onlinethough we dont know for sure he was a td user The guy who ran someone over in Charlottesville fits right into this same group a young white farright kid who was radicalized onlinethough we dont know for sure he was a tD user TD is an active hotbed of farright radicalization Its legitimately dangerous And its not the only sub doing it And Its been ignored more or less since the creation of the sub If any other sub had this consistent degree of backlash and rulebreaking it would have been banned But you guys seem to either intentionally let it go because you either approve of it or are for some reason scared of them Which is it You changed how the front page work during the election TD was abusing it again you let it go You put a bandaid on the problem But of course they got to keep the sub and their booming numbers off the back of abuse And you cant take back the promotion of content that ended up on the front page before you employed the fix Like say a video from Project Veritas or other nonsense along those lines TD is harassing other subs like rpolitics oh well lets tell mods of other subs and TD mods to not allow mentions of eachother to avoid brigading because again lets put a bandaid on the problem and pretend it doesnt really exist I have to honestly wonder what has to happen for you to do anything Does Congress need to call you out to testify Does Mueller need to list TD in an indictment Does a kid need to scream out this is for TD  before he guns someone down Its a fundamentally dangerous situation for more than one reason How we fix it If you ACTUALLY cared You would seek out not only the top suspects for Russian interference on your platform and shut them down while making them public so people know what the disinformation looked like but also seek out the parts of this site that do nothing but bring this site down That promote hate and radicalization and conspiracy These things shouldnt exist They shouldnt be given a platform to go on to claim nonsense that gets people hurt or radicalizes people And you shouldnt allow for a platform that lets Russia or anyone else manipulate people If you want me to personally track down specific threads and info on either topic Russian interference or radicalization and how it was promoted and spread on your site I will happily do so We can make a fucking subreddit dedicated to doing it as a community if you want But its only useful if you are going to actually act Not just keep saying dumb shit like TD is harmless its best to let them stay or Russian propaganda was pushed by Americans so we cant do anything about it I dont have my usual wealth of links to provide here as my desire to find them has been on the backburner in favor of looking into Trump over things like TD but Im sure I can do it if thats what it takes to make this problem clear for people I know users on rAgainstHateSubreddits have been posting quite a lot of info for a while now Im sure plenty of users out there have info on both Russian interference and radicalizationbased poststhreadsetc Your userbase has been complaining about this shit for so long now and theyve been ignored in favor of a vocal minority from one subreddit Lets fix this PS  I know this was a long post but its a rare opportunity to bring this shit up to spez directly when Ive been complaining about it for over a year now Thanks for reading And if you have more info you want to provide along these lines or questions about anything I said send them my way Edit  If you want a true example of the shit Im talking about Look at the comments on my post Promoting either direct attacks on me flatout conspiracies disinformation or defense of Russian interference Again Im not saying this shit because of the politics of not liking Trump This is a real danger and obvious problem on reddit that has been ignored Edit   Yes sandersforpresident and bernie bros were likely influenced by Russian propaganda and influence as well Again this isnt a political thing this is about Russian interference and dangerous radicalization online Nothing else Edit   Guys I have  years worth of reddit gold I appreciate it but I dont need more Sorry if I sound like a dick but Im trying to save you money Edit   If you find yourself trying to rationalize promotion of Uranium One or Seth Rich or any other nonsense you are kinda proving my point Edit  Senate Intel wants to hear from Reddit and is going to talk to Tumblrhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewstheswitchwpsenateinvestigatorswantanswersfromredditandtumblronrussiameddlingutmtermbf Anyway I dont think Spez will reply to me But my main interest is getting people invested in the concerns here and aware of the danger of what can happen on these platforms So if you personally know someone not informed about Russian interference try to talk to them about it If you see someone you know promoting some crazy conspiracies try to talk some sense into them The best thing you can do is keep people informed about what interference looks like and what crazy nonsense looks like People who are properly informed dont fall for it And if Spez or other socialmedia company leaders wont do their jobs then the only alternative is to try to inoculate people to the problem brewing on all these platforms Good luck containing this shitstorm through inaction You basically just came out made a giant post and saidnothing We do  stuff but its up to the users to police things and be better Thanks for nothing uspez Thats great and all but why is rholocaust still allowed to operate Its a subreddit of actually holocaust deniers and antisemites and probably a good deal of Nazis Could we get an explanation as to why this isnt banned Hard to speak about integrity on Reddit when subs like rStealing and rShoplifting are allowed You do know that these ads and propaganda arent coming from just Russian IP addresses right Theyre using American proxies as noted in TheDailyBeasts report I dont need an explanation on the technical aspects but we desperately need more transparency on this platform especially for moderators or theres no way to know exactly what is going on Those thousands of reddit users may be willingly amplifying and spreading Russian propaganda but at the end of the day its your choice to provide a platform for them to spread it on Youve made choices in the past about what isnt acceptable on reddit you have the power to stop this content if you so choose deleted Go frig yourselves We have no evidence of manipulation How about you get off Kushners brothers dick and actually look at whats been provided by your users Some users in

livehttpswwwtheguardiancombusinesslivemarmarketsfalltrumptariffsukconstructionmaypoundbrexitcarneylive Ive submitted multiple reports of posts in rTheDonald which called unironically for the assassination of Hillary Clinton I got emails from Reddits abuse department confirming that they got the reports But the posts are still up However I know you probably have too big of a backlog to adjudicated the reports quickly and accurately So let me repost my suggestion for a jury system that Ive posted in rIdeasForTheAdmins and elsewhere  Allow reddit users to opt in as jurors for adjudicating abuse reports  When someone files an abuse report about a post the system randomly picks  jurors who are currently online and shows them a popup saying A user has reported the following post for violating the following rule Do you agree YesNo  If more than  out of  jurors click Yes then it is assumed the abuse report is valid and the content is removed Or perhaps temporarily removed until reviewed by Reddit staff or maybe pushed to the front of the queue to be reviewed by Reddit staff and then removed This has a couple of nice features  Its lightningfast Since the system queries jurors who are currently online and since they all make their decision in parallel a ruleviolating post can be removed  seconds after its reported  Its scalable As long as the number of jurors grows in proportion to the number of abuse reports which is reasonable if both are proportional to the total user base then the number of votesperjurorpertimeperiod remains constant  Its nongameable You cant recruit your friends or sockpuppets to all come and file complaints against a particular post because the system selects the  jurors from among the entire population of jurors who are currently online You could game the system if you create so many sockpuppets and recruit so many friends that you comprise a majority of the jury pool but assume thats infeasible  Its transparent You dont have to wonder what happened to your abuse report  did it get lost Did it get reviewed and rejected You can receive a response in about  seconds saying We showed your abuse report to a jury of  users and  out of  agreed that the post violated the rules so it has been removed Or not This does depend on the rules being written clearly enough that the average redditor can interpret them and decide if a given post violates the rules or not However the rules are supposed to be written that clearly anyway I really urge people to think about this I have no dog in this fight except that I really actually believe this would solve the problem of the unmanageable backlog of abuse complaints If you get in this thread early enough you can watch the bot astroturfing in realtime deleted Is this the level of moderation were to expect from Reddit as a whole and the subreddit most impacted by thishttpswwwredditcomrTheDonaldcommentshwptrussianbotalgorithmupdatedbanmjonlirsystemstjeejuiqshdf uspez why is rbraincels allowed to stay up when its clearly just rincels So business as usual then Edit Apologies for highlighting another subject on an unrelated thread Didnt intend to hijack the thread  Spez

against an individual or a group of people likewise do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals We understand there are sometimes reasons to post violent content eg educational newsworthy artistic satire documentary etc so if youre going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason

Multipurpose Wind Chime httpsnpredditcomrnomoralscommentstmsfmultipurposewindchime Congratulations on still not addressing TheD situation You are really listening Isnt there the slight chance that propaganda from both sides is promoted on Reddit as a whole I see plenty of stories which are made up exaggerated and just plain wrong but because it fits the narrative they go right to the top We have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong The integrity of reddit doesnt stop at Russian propaganda It is time you do something about places like rthedonald it is time you do something about places like rholocaust When you ban fatpeoplehate but leave these places that are x worse up you are giving your clear support for their existence and empowering them Came here for the shit show Was not disappointed Something that really concerns me is how were identifying propaganda Its one thing to ban bots and I think a lot of subtests deal with this very well but Im very uncomfortable with blanket bans and distinguishing opinions from propaganda Im a Russian I speak Russian I read Russian I write in Cyrillic I am also a US citizen But sharing my opinions on the political climate or my own views can often be met with accusations that Im a Russian bot At the same time I would like my anonymity online to continue How do you deal with making sure you dont cross over into thought policing and continue to encourage in thought provoking discussion without banning entire groups of people I also dont understand how a website that is a public forum and doesnt allow offensive advertising needs to block ads from Russia As a website youre essentially creating sanctions against Russian businesses I just feel generally uncomfortable with the mass everything that comes from Russia infringes on our freedoms rhetoric I look forward to hearing some of your thoughts on this This will definitely get buried but Id just like to raise the point that this issue while important to the overall integrity of the American political system should not be addressed with America only blinkers on when Reddit as a platform is a globally accessible site Being neither American nor Russian and so a third party to the issue I do understand the necessity for uspez and the rest of the Reddit team to cooperate with ongoing investigations within America and realise that there is a very serious issue developing in that country surrounding the problem of Russian interference but Reddit is either multinational or it is not and this post reeks of American antiRussian sentiment The use of tactics such as a blanket ban on Russian based advertising in particular concerns me and I would worry that this action among the others mentioned could be misconstrued as a form of propaganda in its own right Thats not to say no action should be taken and there are obvious points on Reddit which contribute significantly to the issue raised in the post but free speech and open discussion dont equate to American ideals only and I would be concerned that the Reddit team have somewhat forgotten this CEO edited other peoples comments during election time  I wish the was a solution as simple as banning all the propaganda but its not that easy Yes it actually is You have created a forum and we expect you to moderate it It has been explicitly clear that td has been a toxic arm of nationalisticracist propaganda Instead of editing comments you should have banned the sub instead of facilitating the indoctrination of Americans advertisements from Russia are banned This is interesting Which countries do the ads we see on Reddit come from Are there any other countries that arent allowed to buy ads on Reddit Whenever these announcement posts come up  of the time there are a myriad of well thought out post about TD Thats fine HOWEVER Ive yet to see any posts commenting on the outright insulting nature of mods in other big subs I just got banned today from rNews for sharing an article about how Google discriminates against Asianshttpswwwredditcomrnewscommentslslgooglestoppedhiringwhiteandasiancandidates Their reasoning Votebrigading That doesnt make sense because I havent brigaded that post at all It literally has four votes How is that brigading After several questions asking the mods for proof of vote brigading the response I got was Im not playing this game with you and then muted me I believe he didnt provide proof because there is no brigading and I also think the article was removed from both rWorldNewshttpswwwredditcomrworldnewscommentsjdgooglestoppedhiringwhiteandasiancandidates AND rNews because of how it also details racism against whites which apparently does not exist Asian discrimination is continually swept under the rug and this is proof that certain people groups are apparently dispensable to Reddit in the name of appearing antiracist and sticking it to the white man TD comes up all the time about their antics but what about rNews And the other subs This is insulting Ive been with Reddit under different names for over a decade since the Diggasporia gave out multiple Golds to users received multiple golds on previous accounts but Ive never once been banned until today And all I did was share an article that was deleted from rWorldnews because it was US news Apparently neither sub wants to show how racism against Asians exists Why dont you fix the rest of Reddit and stop worrying about an isolated bunch of fanatics You changed the front page algorithm to ensure no sub can get over two items to the front page you implemented a Popular to filter out certain political subs and you apparently stifle TD in others ways BUT the fact that rNews completed nuked the Orlando nightclub shootinghttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsnqnrmbreakingnewsorlandonightclubmassshootingutmcontentcommentsutmmediumbrowseutmsourceredditutmnameAskReddit doesnt upset you guys My sister and HER WIFE are gay and you allowed rNews to get away with hiding that post DURING the shooting Absolutely insulting That you guys never once addressed that disaster is a disaster on your part Or the fact that immediately after the election there were like  new subs all dedicated to the sole purpose of hating on Trump Thats not news and opinion thats brigading I was born overseas Im a lifelong registered Dem I believe in Universal healthcare at an affordable and auditable method I dont believe in a national border wall and I live in Arizona and grew up near the border I proudly voted for Obama twice shook the hand of my close friend when CNN announced ACA passed and wouldve loved to vote Biden Im not worried about one sub in particular like TD What I am worried about is the corrupt nature of Reddit and how its overtaking all opinions that dont align with it Fix the rest of Reddit and stop with this astroturfing of political mindsets being shoved down my throat There is no integrity if the same principles do not apply to the other subs Edit I appreciate Reddit and its the only social media platform I have anymore In a weird geeky way its close to my heart as its influenced a lot of my opinions and life outlook That being said Ive seen it shift since joining a decade ago Im not pining for the good ole days but one cant unsee how much this place changed after the Charlie Hebdo attacks and after the Presidential candidates won their parties and started the Generals All I want is open discussion I dont even need unregulated just open I wish you would have defined what reddit classifies as propaganda By loose definition almost every news story published in the states by an american is also propaganda Singling out similar news stories published in the States by Russian sources is hypocritical and frankly is a beautify example of American exceptionalism Youre getting a lot of hate on here but Id like to say that you are doing a great job in my opinion Keeping reddit leaning towards tolerance instead of censorship is the best way to go Ive heard your reasoning about td on a podcast and it seems like you know what youre doing and have a vision separate from your political opinion and I respect that Best of luck So Reddit is unable to do anything about td but it can ban SanctionedSuicide and force people to shut up and go back to the same old useless hotlines Thanks Reddit Way to get tough on policy and care for your users Integrity FUCK YOU FOR BANNING RGUNDEALS Why ban rgundeals There was nothing about it that violated reddits terms Its literally the same thing as rgamedeals but for guns Chickens are coming home to roost This platform is designed to produce echo chambers whether this was done purposefully is hard to tell If you think that the extent of your problems are TD Ive got news for you When you can downvote opinions you dont like or better yet ban posters who produce many ideas you dont like you cant have nice things If youve eliminated everyone with a dissenting opinion people are in a state of seeing what they want to see to support their preconceptions instead of seeing truth  and no one wants or is allowed to tell the Emperor he has no clothes Unless reddit takes a hard stance on this problem it can only get worse I dont believe reddit was designed to become partitioned echo chambers but thats certainly what has happened To solve it you have to take on a principle of inclusion debate and evidence  something not easily accomplished as everyone comes here to consume their prepackaged narrative to fit their own biases and narratives  I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda You know there is a simple solution you just dont want to deal with it grabs popcorn sorts by controversial I feel like in Cold War era again Being a Russian on Twitter or Reddit must be pretty hard You are not arguing genuinely Reddit is comprised of some extremely antiwomen people There are entire subreddits dedicated to solely being antiwomen in one form or another Promoting an underrepresented and often harassed part of the reddit population through a subreddit dedicated to women is how to fix this It does not as you say promote sexism of one kind when sexism of another exists Its to right a perceived wrong within the community I suppose you also believe that a student activities group for minorities is racist if the school does not offer a whiteonly student group as well On Reddit integrity Current Reddit censorship policy  has outright banned communities dealing with deals related to alcohol tobacco and firearms all legal in the US while allowing communities dealing in federally illegal drugs to thrive httpswwwredditcomrWeedDeals Reddit has no integrity because the users dont The level of willfully ignorant people on this site is staggering People who when facts are presented and I mean facts that are independently verified and vetted not from an echo chamber they downvote to oblivion and doxx the user People who would rather pull the child who pointed out the emperor has no clothes to the ground and stomp them to death rather than face the fact that they were duped Reddit is what ever the users make it I belong to wonderful encouraging sub reddits that are positive and a joy to post on The main reddits are shit x being a default and many others is sickening but instead of bitching I simply remove them from my feed The hypocrisy of the the admin staff is obvious The fact that they have admitted to editing posts by users is just disgusting and reveals what a shit show this site really is Again I just stick to the smaller communities and ignore the rest I recommend others do the same  this is a burden we all bear Diffuse the blame its your fault too  I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda but its not that easy This is like really hard believe me  Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey No one knew this could be so complicated  I know its frustrating that we dont share everything we know publicly And we never will until it impacts our shareholderspublic image  letting them fall apart from their own dysfunction probably will Their engagement is shrinking over time and thats much more powerful than shutting them down outright The plan appears to be do nothing and see what happens So to sum were all to blame reddit has no responsibility for dealing with this problem its something that will just self regulate itself out of being a problem and nothing needs to be done Spez right now httpsiimgurcomcjtpng Wasnt rTheDonald a big place for this russian propaganda stuff why isnt it being addressed that a place so filled with hate is still active despite breaking nearly every rule on site are you scared that once the sub is gone the hate will spill into other subreddits i do get that could be an issue but this has been going on for too long now when do you say enough is enough Ah the YouTube strategy Damage control wont work here Reddit IS a platform for the worst people out there Well this argument sounds familiar If we ban false information there will still be false information How does being a global company based in America affect Reddits approach to propaganda Obviously Russian propaganda is a huge issue in America I can imagine American propaganda is a huge issue in other countries Does one side of the equation get more attention than the other Or is Reddit trying to address all forms of propaganda I imagine it has to be difficult to differentiate propaganda without impeading free speech that this site so strongly stands for Congratulations on being included in the investigation for giving a platform to foreign psyops Get a lawyer Its the internet Kind of hard to have your cake and eat it too Regardless of what investigations do or do not turn things up people really need to educate themselves and their children about the fact that there are little to no assurances that what you see and read online has any veracity and isnt agenda laden Such is life in an anonymous connected world The web didnt just democratize the good stuff We have to understand that along with the cat videos and porn also comes easy access to our minds and lives from people corporations and foreign actors who arent necessarily acting in you interest As someone who is neither an american nor russian and has no dog in this fight as an outsider its remarkable to see McCarthyism come back so strongly So when is td going to be put down I understand its hard You cant just stop propaganda but you can stop focal points You really want to do something Heres what  Ban rTheDonald Just fucking remove it completely  Ban their associate subreddits  Ban their mods and bots This is just one node of the cancer that is altright Russian and political propaganda as a whole but enough is enough Excise this tumour and were well on the way to a better reddit TLDR  Spez and the admins refuse to do anything Remember if you disagree with someone or if someone proves you wrong theyre a Russian bot Stop peddling this conspiracy theory We do NOT need you to curate opinions By all means get rid of graphic violence and sexual exploitation But it is not only futile but also unnecessary to protect the public from political words and images even if the origin is sketchy From what Ive seen reddit or at least posters on reddit have pushed the US propaganda against Russia As an outside observer it seams as if Americans want a hot war to go with the new Cold War they started deleted Nobody is going to take you seriously until you ban the donald nor should they Either your rules matter or they dont This is propaganda and all the Russian meddling stories are nothing more than saying the words Russian Propaganda Its all bullshit I am sick of hearing about it Nobody meddled with or influenced the election in any way most people are just idiots Period Content from accounts you suspect are of Russian Origin What about normal Russian users not spreading propaganda will they be in danger too I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda but its not that easy Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey Its up to all of usRedditors citizens journaliststo work through these issues Its somewhat ironic but I actually believe what were going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse and fight back against propaganda whether foreign or not This is  gradea bullshit Youre complaining there isnt a simple solution to a problem that only exists because you force it to exist Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey NO That is a thoughtterminating cliche We can objectively measure the truth of many things We know when Trump lies for example because we have facts to verify against YOU  you specifically  have created this shades of grey bullshit Fuck me you are making it worse by saying this but you know that but I actually believe what were going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse Bullshit Whose standards Right now you artificially inflate the standards of a certain side Right now you artificially lower the quality of discourse We cant ban propaganda but we can fight it by not giving it room to grow We cant ban hate but we can reduce it by starving it You cant just do nothing and expect things to work themselves out Also Im betting well see something in the news later yeah Why else would you write this hateapologist manifesto Ignoring the elephant in the room helps no one TD is a platform for hate and is radicalizing gullible Americans As long as you continue to provide a platform for the alt right to spread their hatred and recruit  with the help of Russian agents  your frustrations and thinking on the subject comes across as hollow and disingenuous EDIT Stop going there is the same as saying close your eyes and pretend they arent being given a platform to recruit and spread propaganda No thanks Whataboutism and saying but teh left is just as bad No they arent By any meaningful measure The left isnt celebrating the death of school children or attacking the survivors of shootings or radicalizing the shooters They arent a tool of Russias attempt to break the soft power of the west They arent a haven for nazis and white supremacists EDIT  Misinformation is obvious The information in the dossier is reliable and verified  and its being verified even further by Mueller And its not from Russia httpswwwnewyorkercommagazinechristophersteelethemanbehindthetrumpdossier Seriously  do trolls even try How lazy are they lol EDIT  Look for evidence yourself We provide evidence over and over and you ignore it or claim thats not everyone Were over your bullshit and doing your legwork for you EDIT  The more trolls say I havent seen evidence the less credibility you have The more you say just move on the more we will organize and fight Fighting through advertisers seems to be working applying pressure  so its obvious the more we fight and point it out  the more we win Thanks for the update I do have a question While I do agree that everyone should read anything on the internet with their guard up Why should the whole of Reddit continue to be forced to read propaganda from subreddits which have been and continue to be a problem Encouraging and spreading propaganda or by users that knowingly attempt to entice redditors into arguments or knowingly spread misinformation should be of some concern should it not In keeping those subreddits alive Reddit is directly helping the hand that spreads the propaganda Watching from the sidelines is just as bad as promoting it yourself Reddit doesnt promote Russian propaganda Everyone knows Reddit is a tool for the extreme left to promote their liberal agenda What reddit needs to implement is a limit on how many subs one single account can be a mod for It is logically impossible to be a mod for more than a couple of subs yet there is a small cartel of mods that essentially control majority of popular content on reddit The entire point of mods is for the COMMUNITY to mange the content not a small select of people who bully and intimidate everyone else One would have to be paid a fulltime wage to have not only the time but to be an effective mod of more than a couple of subs but there are people who are mods over s of subs Surely you must see how illogical that scenario is Either those accounts are held by selfinterest groups or individuals who are paid to serve an agenda So propaganda is fine as long as it isnt of Russian origin What a joke Reddit and the US has become Propaganda aside a for a second can you at least enforce the fucking rules when it comes to blatant racismsexism and the calls for violence that happen ALL THE TIME in these subreddits If you want to start somewhere but dont want to destroy their echo chamber for whatever stupid reason then at least do your fucking job consistently Make a joke that sounds like its inciting violence anywhere else Instant ban Actually incite violence in TD to spread more pointless hatred and possibly lead to people actually dying Oh no thats fine according to Reddit I would love to use the mobile web site without constantly being harangued this content is best viewed in our mobile app into installing the app Like actually clicking this content is best viewed in our mobile app images without having to dismiss a call to action to install the app I just this content is best viewed in our mobile app want to use the website I get that app installs and usage is a metric that this content is best viewed in our mobile app boards love to see but can we please get an opt out flag for using the site without being bombarded by this content is best viewed in our mobile app dark patterns  Additionally well be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months and twofactor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks Are either of these optout The new profile pages Ive seen leave me lost and confused but Ill be damned if Im tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login Are you selling our data  The Reddit API support and documentation is woeful right now Are there plans to change that I recently built a Reddit app for iOShttpswwwredditcomrapplecommentsrtuintroducingapolloabrandnewredditexperience and it was not an easy process Communication with Reddit often times took upwards of a year to hear anything back the API documentation is woefully lacking in many areas and often times there will be breaking API changes where developers receive absolutely no notice one instance being the recent addition of blocked users which completely broke the friends APIhttpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsiosredditchangefilterincomingmessagestotrusteddbktax causing a big break in my app with no notice and I had to scramble to fix it I know we dont pay anything to use the API but the communication is really rough right now as well as the documentation Id be happy to pay I pay a small fee to Imgur to use their API and their support is phenomenal and quick and their documentation outstanding  Why is there such inconsistency among usage of Snoo in app icons I got a call from Reddit a few days ago telling me to change my iconhttpsitunesapplecomusappapolloredditclientidmt because its too similar to Snoo but there are tons of other apps in the App Store that literally have Snoo in their iconhttpswwwredditcomrapolloappcommentscgnfsomeotherredditappsiconsintheappstore pixel for pixel and are getting frequent updates for years without any issues While I disagree that my icon is confusingly similar to the Reddit logo I designed it with notable differences that distance it why not enforce the rule uniformly and consistently It really feels like I was targeted specifically because my app was popular and youve had years to go after other violations EDIT Ah man was really hoping for an answer Is the front page still limited to a random sampling of  of your subscribed subreddits  if gold I always find this a frustrating limitation of reddits technology as I feel like Im missing items from subreddits I care about unless I slice them up into many different multireddits Why does the official Reddit app not support the Reddit video player Any time I click on a link that contains the video player I get sent to the Reddit mobile page and a popup saying how much better Reddit is on the Reddit app YouTube videos work better than Reddit videos on the Reddit app Even Twitter videos work better on the Reddit app than Reddit videos do Edit I updated the app and videos from vreddit are playing now rather than showing me Reddit mobile and suggesting I use the app Over the years Reddit has grown from small groups of people submitting content to subs and sharing with each other in a series of available public forums to a number one site on the internet Now in addition to private parties sharing what they love we have corporations political figures and media outlets using this as a social media platform not just as a means of contracting with fanscustomersconstituents but as a means of pushing an agenda While the web traffic is appealing I have to ask Is this in line with the original vision for Reddit Is this how we can expect the future to be or is there hope of some change to the way Reddit is used by those with money to influence the content on this site Interested in hearing the impact of all and popular now that it has been well established Any thoughts on that Did it achieve what you hopped any headlines positive  negative impacts  Edit grammar Will the search function ever improve Dear uspez  As a frequenter of many different subreddits some of which are based on opposed ideologies I must ask how are you planning to deal with subreddits that automatically ban users based on their participation in other subs On more than one occasion Ive received messages from subreddits Ive never heard of simply for commenting on a post in an unrelated subreddit This practice violates Reddits guidelines and discriminates against users based on ideology Can we expect any form of help in keeping Reddit one of the few remaining sites dedicated to neutrality Will there ever be any improvement to the messaging system on Reddit Or prehaps a text formating bar for typing on mobile deleted Hiya Spez Does Reddit have any plans to stratify  and fix  the way moderators work  The moderator hierarchy is currently top down which means one stoneddrunkcranky mod can effectively mess up all mods below them I would recommend you think of making permissions more granular than the  categories that exist full access config mail flair post wiki There should be a provision available for mods below to nuke mods on top or change their permissions if such permissions have been granted to them and so on It will make mod lists far more equitable in nature and reduce the pressure on admins to step in an fix issues  Additionally why does Reddit administration disappear on weekends Facebook and Twitter are said to be hiring mods and you can view a Facebook mods profile herehttpswwwtheguardiancomnewsmayfacebookmoderatorsquickguidejobchallenges Why doesnt Reddit think of doing this  hiring sitewide supermods who arent exactly admins but not pleb mods either to step in and stop blatant vote manipulation like the sock guy or dox and stuff This is especially necessary on the weekends when it is hard to get any response from admins Ive seen calls for hiring supermods on a few of these threads and the admins are kind of mute about this Im not sure what you think of this so please let me know Why is rFreshModels NSFW child porn content and its network allowed to exist on this site They have toddlers on their subreddit header and posts like thishttpsiimgurcomjJaDjpg are currently on their front page And were supposed to believe them making comments about six year old little girls like Shes just so compact and beautiful isnt sexualizing them in any way What about the girl in the pic I linked What sort of comments are they making about this child that looks barely old enough to start school  So cute   Something about this makes her look so grownup   Her eyes are mesmerizing   Cant stop gazing into them   She looks so cute sitting there Maybe a little bored though Looks like her mummy left her watching the bags while shes trying on clothes   Wish I went to her school   Perfect   Amazingly cute People cant post pictures of adult women to sexualize them without their permission so why can they do it with children EDIT It looks like the sub I linked has been banned now but the rest of their network like rFreshDancers rFreshGymnasts and more remain up in case their main sub got banned EDIT I guess theyre scared because theyre quickly setting all of their pedo subs to private Mobile user here Are you guys looking to implement more detailed subreddit info on the mobile app When I go onto a subreddit Im currently unable to view the subreddit rules etc and a lot of times have my posts removed because of my lack of information Thank you How are you preventing Russian bots from meddling with the reddit experience Do you ever sit down and think God what did I just get myself into I asked this questionhttpswwwredditcomrmodnewscommentspbzupdateonsitewiderulesregardingviolentcontentdovvyns on the other thread but did not get a reply so Im reposting it here  So I have a question about this as a mod of rchangemyview Our current rules prohibit threats of violence against any individual user of Reddit We expressly do NOT however ban people from posting views which might express sympathy with racism or violence against generalized groups We take the position that we would want to help people holding such views to change those views But that requires that we not prohibit their mention Would this require us to change our rules to prohibit such content When reddit video was announced I know several people brought up concerns of youtube videos being stolen and uploaded to it stealing revenue from the creators You guys didnt seem to think that would be an issue but there have been several posts that made it on the front page with this issue They were uploaded to reddit video and unattributed Opening yourselves up to DMCA stuff doesnt seem like a good idea What are your thoughts and are you guys doing anything to prevent this Why was it only in the last week that the new policy on violence was instated What is the process like for considering and implementing newchanged policies Why arent alpha testers getting responses from admins I asked what the goal of the redesign is and the question went completely unanswered Sowhat is the goal of the redesign What makes it a success Without a goal were all just yelling out suggestions pretending to have opinions that matter Im new here so Im sorry if this has been explained and I missed it but what is the goal of the redesign As a web developer with  years of experience it makes me nervous to see a redesign project without a clearly defined goal Did a pointyhaired bosshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPointyhairedBoss just walk in one day and announce a redesign What goal determines that the redesign is successful Without that were all just a bunch of chiefs shouting out suggestions What are your thoughts about ugallowboob  Do you think that it is a big step on Reddits side of him getting a job by having the most karma Why does reddit allow the blantant censorship at rbitcoin  Censorship stats for September httpswwwredditcomrnoncensoredbitcoincommentsnfseptemberstatspost Hey uspez I would like to ask in accordance to your healthy community guidelineshttpswwwredditcomhelphealthycommunities there are moderators you would personally attack and ban redditors who they dont like There is a rIndia moderator who has been persistently been doing this I have compiled it here httpsnpredditcomrindiadiscussioncommentsmsrtpersonalattacksareallowedwhenrindiamods Can you elaborate if this is unhealthy behaviour or not Thanks deleted When will the recent rule changes against glorifying violence etc mean a ban on rincels You simply cant defend a sub that not only apologizes for rapists but encourages rape The sub is a stain on this site and everyone who comes here edit hi rincels Looks like you got cucked by chad again edit people are asking for examples this is some I found within  minutes of searching Just read the sub and it will speak for itself httpsiredditlwuofvvmnzjpg httpsiredditkywgpkzjpg httpsireddithkiojepvwfzjpg httpsiredditzidlyszpng Thanks for coming on I appreciate reddit for being open to discussions There are some subreddits in particular I find censored for interests of certain individuals In this case rbitcoin is being heavily censored to enrich a select few and is actively hiding comments deleting them and banning open discussions What are your thoughts on subreddits that have mods actively censoring the entire discussion and keeping redditors from having all the knowledge they need and having the open discussion that are needed Thank you and have a great day Why is a group of squid not called a squad deleted What is being done towards karma farming accounts Im sick of seeing the same post from  months ago posted over and over in  different subs from the same user with over  million karma who pretty much exists solely for that reason deleted  Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content you mean the one youre not enforcing Check my recent modmails to rredditcom Apparently a guy using multiple alts to spam an entire modteam with kill yourself is aokay with you guys as despite an admin dealing with him all his accounts are still active Or the accounts in one thread harassing a user telling him to drink bleach and other fun stuff Despite all these accounts violating your revised policy on violent content using alts to harass somebody pointing where all the users are coming from a specific thread in a different subreddit and an admin reviewing it you guys are perfectly content to not action the accounts under your new policy despite happening after the policy was implemented So when are you guys actually going to enforce your policy outside a few token bans to make it look like youre serious Do we have to use profile pages I really dont like them Feels too much like social media which i actively stay away from Hi Spez Is there any possibility there could be stricter guidelinesguardrails on bots within subs Its a minor issue but I frequent a lot of subreddits and I see bots that are increasingly generic and unnecessary popping up Just speaking personally its a little annoying to scroll through a thread for only a few posts before seeing a main post followed by a bot followed by Good Bot followed by a bot followed by people summoning all sorts of other bots through otherwise basic text inputs It takes away from the focus of the thread and encourages derailing discussions and it only gets worse when theyre heavily upvoted by other botstrolls to make them much higher than they need to be I do block them but people keep making more There are bots that pop up now when you use I am in your post as some sort of dad joke It would be nice if these types of automated systems were approved first before being released on your site In regards to the site wide rule changes we keep seeing Reddit acting in reaction to things when they receive a lot of publicity but when the publicity fades away subreddits and users who were removed are back under a new name As noted on the modnews posthttpswwwredditcomrmodnewscommentspbzupdateonsitewiderulesregardingviolentcontent by ugrickit herehttpswwwredditcomrmodnewscommentspbzupdateonsitewiderulesregardingviolentcontentdovjxcp and followed up with uimnotjesus comment herehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfpdaxtimetotalkckbgavcontextckbgav this has been a cycle we have been going through for years Can you talk to specifics on why this time will be different Specifically the kinds of resources you are dedicating not just in a push but consistently throughout to continue enforcement of these rules Hiring people and dedicating their time to this seems to be the only way to accomplish this I know you have done some hiring in this realm but we still seem to be stuck in this cyclical nature BTW I am fully aware as Im sure you are that trying to enforce these standards is akin to a Kobayashi Maru The harder you squeeze the more adamantly the elements you are trying to remove from Reddit will fight back The more lackadaisical you are to the various violent contentthreats on the site the more negative PR and general user complaints you receive I wish you luck in your endeavors you will need it What is reddit doing to find and shut down toxic communities before they rise to the level of media prominence Spez are the prizes from the Conan photoshop battle still at Reddit HQ or are they lost in the wind Another selected winner and I have been having quite the trouble figuring out whats going on on that front after the original admin who messaged us about our addresses suddenly lost their adminship Edit apparently there are at least three of us experiencing lack of communication in this ushiruken udomdomburg  and myself Edit  Got a response while writing the previous edit which is now somewhat

EVERY YEAR since  trying to get me sitewide banned I have thousands of screenshots that should lead to this mans own personal banning and his lolipedophilia nfsw subreddits Not to mention my beloved subreddit he made rlukecis has been permanently banned by your mod team for no reason other than harassment harassment has not taken place on that place since  I believe and it was all just random joke and memes about soarels degeneracy I only post jokes and memes your mod team seems to think it is all hate speech I do not agree I believe your team has been misled and subverted by convert soarel dogshit claims and his cabal of loli pedophile ring of autism that cannot be left to stand I will now provide proof and evidence of his absolutely batshit insane Incel ideology mixed with feminist agenda Here is a link httpsdrivegooglecomopenidwUZetJiDsAzJEPmPKwlXYJTdY also your admins specifically uOcrasorm never replied to any of my pleas for help which I sent tens of and have had over  people ask the same thing On top of this ust  has been banning me nonstop from rshittydarksouls after removing me as a mod because he just doesnt like me after I had served faithfully for a very long time I really hope you guys can contact the owner or top mods of the subreddit and restore me as mod and remove him for he has abandoned his duty and has no care for the subreddit only contempt EDIT ST has doxxed me given out my locations ips and banned me from multiple discords and left my own please help deleted Ive been using Reddit for four years now It is really starting to annoy me how obviously its being gamed by large corporations Any platform that attracts nearly  million individual users is going to attract their attention as well and you frequently see posts pushing stealth advertisements Heres a picture of my cat Please do not mind the overly visible ColaFlavored BeverageTM logo in the background or shills manipulating upvotes in the thousands I understand it is not trivial to combat this but I would still like to know if Reddit is doing anything about this at all It is affecting my trust Spez is there any chance that a subreddit whos moderators are dedicated to pushing a particular agenda and censoring posts they disagree with be fixed For example rIndias moderators have a track record of consistently removing any posts and comments that exhibit the current government in a positive light Considering the amount of social media agencies working for political parties it is possible that some of the aforementioned mods might be paid to indulge in the above activities While I understand that we are free to create new subs I think that the importance of the subreddits name is also a key factor in attracting users  my point is that even if I were to start a subreddit that would not censor discussions politically most of the users on the original sub would never hear of it To summarise does Reddit have any policy to remove abusive moderators especially on subreddits which attract a large amount of users Have you considered updating the search function Maybe its better on PC but on the mobile reddit app its a struggle NSFW posts also are not displayed when searching on mobile Probably similar to folks bringing up rthedonald here but I feel the need to bring attention the rincels The mods have a history of banning people who oppose anything being said on there Theres no constructive conversation going on there to deal with the extreme view points shared on there It its an echo chamber of toxicity I dont think they should be outright banned as Im all for less censorship but they HAVE to be kept in check And that should fall on the mods But doesnt Idk what do you think Hi spez I was initially in support of the country specific home page but over time Ive come to change my mind The subreddit rIndia is really toxic and its as bad as thedonald being on the front page all the time Can this no longer be a default option but rather optin Thanks Why are the rest of the social media companies being called before congress and not you Surely youre not saying Russian trolls werent active on reddit Hi Spez Im curious if there will ever be any changes made to the way Reddit handles PMs and messages in general the current system seems fairly outdated Are there any plans to optimize this system along with profiles in general And if so what sort of timeline can we expect What  of usernames are in fact bots would you say Why are Russians and Trump supporters moderating rBulgaria That is fucked up They ban for everything they dont agree and dont answer any mod messages This is the subreddit of my country removed As a top mod for many subreddits I keep needing to rearrange the order of the mods below me Presently the only way is to remove all the mods and readd them in the way I want This takes a long time since I have to wait for each mod to readd themselves I know admins have the ability to rearrange mods without having to wait for users When can we top mods get something additional mod tools to simply this process  Please remove riceposeidon from rall or maybe reddit altogether Its a whole sub dedicated to abusing and bullying a streamers girlfriend and this week has taken to spamming porn Its toxic  You owe the community an explanation as to why thedonald is allowed to continue to operate after another one of reddits famous clean ups Thanks Edit  seeing as this is gaining prominence perhapswe can talk about rfreshmodels and why reddit is ok with paedophilia Edit by rall I meant rpopular However uspez has chosen to pretend that I edited in my second question for some reason To clarify I did not HerehttpsgredditmediacomhQTceWlZLiVRIZODcAICSTusrVrKbjSlQIgifwfmmpmpfragmentedfalsesdfbeaadcfbfe is what it looks like in action Edit change in link to mp Edit  For those of you with RES use this linkhttpsiredditnbxbvukzywgif In the past when it came to controversialillegal content youve stood on the premise of we arent hosting the content just pointing to it Does this meaningfully change your content strategies andor policies Is there a planned retention policy Or is it an as long as reddit has the money to maintain the servers the images will stay forever kind of deal Is EXIF data stripped What has changed which made you want to do this yourselves Some random questions  apologies if these are asked  answered elsewhere or are blindingly obvious if you use the feature on a desktop Whats the copyright deal when uploading to reddit images Can they offically be republished by others By Reddit Whats the copyright deal if you get complaints Ie a company says its their picture What if the uploader disagrees Can images only be viewed via Redditcom or are you planning a twitter cards style embedded situation etc You said images will be deleted if the post is deleted Can you delete the image separately from the post Do you do any smart this is the same image as that duplicate managing  if so what happens if one post is deleted Any support for keyboard shortcuts when navigating through galleries Makes it much easier for onehanded navigation You know in case of severe injury When I share a reddit image with my friends I usually just right click it and copy image address  with imgur it worked perfectly but with these reddit uploads it copies this huge string httpsiredditmediacomkWAkhVHjbSwxCewogwdNcAzjYPreupOMpngwsdabebeefcbbec Why is that Can we have it fixed Make them scalable Thats the most annoying thing when I open one of these links RES allows me to scale with the mouse images but not these reddit hosted ones deleted deleted Imgur mirror httpiimgurcompDgONNpng Why is the snoo wearing a German football kit Are GIFs converted to WebMother HTML format or kept in their original gif format Seems like this will be pretty costly to maintain With big increases to expenses whats Reddits plan to increase revenue correspondingly deleted How does Reddit have the bandwidth capability for this when it barely has it for the normal text demand from its users I dont want to see the Reddit unable to connect message more than the usual  or  times a day Well Id like to give some feedback Whats up with the color fidelity and compression From this submission I made about a photo I took in Japanhttpswwwredditcomrpicscommentsmqfitookapictureofaquietstreetatnightin the originalhttpscstaticflickrcomekjpg and the compressed rehost used for the thumbnailhttpsiredditmediacomQMHUGPgRFeVItvdpwpBLiNZbocvdyDgFcRUjpgwsacddfdaba Notice the way dialed down yellow for instance By the way I never permitted that rehost when submitting a flickr image to rpics Im not annoyed that it was rehosted Id just like there to be a heads up when that happens And Id prefer for the color fidelity to be at least somewhat more similar Beyond that thanks for the image hosting service Its neat to see that the hosting will be done at reddit instead of the typical imgur Their pushing the imgur app to mobile users has been quite annoying  edit for those interested heres the full size uncompressed imagehttpswwwflickrcomphotosnoaceulemans direct linkhttpscstaticflickrcomfdbojpg  Flickr does a great job of hosting images at full resolution but can be a bit annoying to navigate deleted How will copyrighted images be handled When will NSFW be expanded into Yay Imgur has become the same bloated hosting site that uMrGrim was trying to replace Any plans to allow image uploads more generally For example to post an image as a comment cant resize image by dragging it  sucks e i feel dumb for many reasons one of them is maybe because its something that RES do and not Reddit What if we want to share an image elsewhere httpsiredditmediacomkWAkhVHjbSwxCewogwdNcAzjYPreupOMpngwsdabebeefcbbec isnt exactly userfriendly As long as using the direct image link is standard I like this I hate browsing nondirect Imgur links on my phone Any way to post albums planned for the future Can someone explain why I cant drag to resize with RES on images hosted using this whats the difference between ireddituploadscom and ireddit Not necessarily your guys fault but any ireddituploads image cant be resized with res and makes me not click on them deleted deleted It would be awesome if Alien Blue got an update to support long press thumbnail viewing for reddit uploads Considering AB is no longer under development how could we make this happen Any chance of uploading a gif and then posting it later I usually upload all my new gifs over the weekend and post them throughout the week Without that feature Im not sure this works for me or most gifmakers Hi Im not super technical so I dont know the details of whats actually happening here but Ive used Hoversee for ages and cant imagine browsing reddit without it now The only thing is it doesnt work with the reddit uploads only imgur and it does struggle with gfycat too Is this something that could be looked at this end or entirely Hoversees problem Thanks Will this lead to banning competing hosts Great feature One small concern Why cant I resize it by clicking and dragging in the browser window I can do that on almost all images but you guys are displaying them in some way that the browser doesnt allow us to dynamically resize them This seems like a good place to ask this Why do I get URI signature match failed or Unauthorized when trying to view these links in my phones third party app or the browser Strangely doesnt happen with the image linked here explaining the changes  Let me drag to scale the image like Imgur allows  Let me rightclick copy image link and embed it on forums elsewhere like Imgur allows The only complaints I have at the moment are that the images arent scalable and the links dont turn purple or seen after you view them in RES Fix these two things and there you go SFW Oh boy There is going to be a big debate about what is NSFW because of this Just host all content that isnt illegal and make it easy on yourself Reddit Also RIP Imgur Does your image service provide a way for the image uploader to change his mind and delete the image from your server at a later time Does your image host allow hotlinking from sites different from Reddit The only problem with this that I have is that the images so far cant be opened with Hover Free the free hoverzoom extention thing will this be updated Clicking on a Reddithosted image will take you directly to the conversation about that image Can we have an account option to not do this and instead take us to the actual image Not everyone wants to read the comments some of us just want to look at pictures The only reason Im not happy for this is because I can usually hit the save image button on alien blue of I see a picture I want to keep but with the new reddit hosting it wont save it so I cant save any pictures An image of Snoo with various items including hair a soccer ball and wearing a shirt Snoo is saying  Hi everyone  A few weeks ago we began testing image uploading on Reddit Given high demand were expanding the feature to all SFW communities that allow images     Starting today when you create a link post in a participating community youll be able to upload an image on desktop    Upload images up to MB and gifs MB directly to Reddit when posting   Clicking on a Reddithosted image will take you directly to the conversation about that image   View Reddit hosted gifs inline within Reddits native iOS and Android apps     Please give it a try and post any feedback you have We would love to hear how we can make Reddit even better for all of you PLEASE make your hosted images work correctly with RES As of right now images show up as videos and they can not be resized Its very annoying and is detracting from the user experience With RES and imgur hosting you can expand the image from your home page and click and drag to resize Do you plan on ever copying this feature for ireddit links I wish the links for these ireddit images would turn purple when I expand them on the frontpage Why the fuck would you encourage mb gifs Do you just hate your own bandwidth It doesnt work on all mobile apps for example BaconReader Turn on IPv on your cloudflare please No thanks Dont need you guys being able to censor more than you already do you scumbags With imgur Dog pictures looks very cute is this new format going to affect the cuteness of the dogs Edit  Gold the same day that my previous gold expired Thanks reddit you are awesome i always knew dogs are the best Im not sure if its my version of RES but I cant easily resize these hosted images Any change that can be looked at That German allegience Have you considered hosting images via their MD hash value in order to potentially save huge amounts of server space edit a word My only question Are the servers ready Out of interest how much might this affect reddits server costs It seems like reddit had a pretty sweet deal by only having to serve the revenuegiving html pages and having imgurcom handle the expenses of image traffic Especially since most images are opened inline Also most importantly are you compressing pngs into jpgs or recompressing jpgs at all Neat Good job gu Wait what about SRS Could you explain this  You began to implement this the same time you let out the official apps and strangely a lot of apps cant or have trouble loading things with redditupload alien blue baconit readit Are you trying to force people to use your official app with this kind of move  Thank god now we wont have toxic imgur comments on pictures we upload as someone whos workplace has imgur blocked nice A very big problem I have with reddit image hosting is that some of the URLs are excessively long I mean URLs like these httpsiredditmediacomQMHUGPgRFeVItvdpwpBLiNZbocvdyDgFcRUjpgwsacddfdaba  it requires the entire thing You cant strip the s part Its impossible to use these in texts or instant messages I noticed the image in OP is httpsiredditlasmnloxpng but sometimes the only URL I see is the example I gave above and its very cumbersome Cant drag and resize reddit uploaded images in RES Im not going to use it until they fix this Imgur mirrorhttpiimgurcomZxkJCljpg for those who want it Not that its probably your fault but the link doesnt show as purple when I look at it inline with RES Why are the randomlygenerated URLs so long For example httpsiredditlasmnloxpng It appears youre using  random lowercase characters  numbers in the file name but do you really need         possibilities You could add uppercase letters decrease this to  random characters and still maintain    or  trillion possible combinations That way the URLs would be shorter and easier to remember and copypaste Can Reddit ditch its scrolling signup window of death What a terrible idea httpsmredditcomrassholedesigncommentsoimdoscrollingthroughredditsortconfidenceutmsourcemwebredirectcompacttrue Any plans for steering wheel support Can someone share an ELI background on why Imgur is being ditched Any word when clickdrag to enlarge via RES will be supported Or do you not give any fucks about that Thats pretty cool I have some questions about privacy Are the images hosted directly on reddit or you can have acess from outside Ive seen some people on imgur accidentally uploading public pictures of personal things like NSFW things and getting bashed on imgur for that Also I dont know if you could delete your pictures without an account  Are uploaded images now directly attached to your username so to delete a photo you would delete the post What about reposts Its a shame I cant clickzoom them with RES like I can with Imgur Reddit images URLs suck Where imgur has a nice short URL Reddit uses this crazy long string Makes it tough when copying and pasting Is this about that reddituploads shit They wont load on my phone I just get a blank page that says unauthorized Will you fix that When I tried this with a gif two weeks ago I noticed that  My gif was absurdly low quality for a while after posting I mean gigantic clouds of discoloration  frame per second maybe gigantic blocks of distorted pixels etc The quality got better after a while but Id rather have it sit through a processing page first and post at top quality than have it posted immediately but look like crap for a while  You cant drag to resize I miss that feature Lots of people talking about various little problem  missing feature All I can say is that we should expect reddit to expends  fix these stuff slowly Dont expect too much Having said that This is totally a right step I cant understand why Reddit relying so heavily on rd party sites for so long Overtime all rd party will fall to greed Not saying Reddit wont but at least reddit can control its features Great I look forward to reddit finding new and innovative ways to allow users to provide information that will be immediately censored by the mods I cant resize any reddit picture with RES they all show up as videos and the window cannot be resized Would it be possible to add fake image extensions to the URLs Without an image extension imageacting extensions like HoverZoom dont act on uploaded image links You had  requests from the UK Govt Are you able to say whether you complied fully with the requests eg you were requested but ultimately did not give information and are you able to say more on each case  Request  A company Company A issued a subpoena to Reddit seeking private account information about a user who made a post on Reddit that was critical of a company related to Company A Company B The post was based in fact and expressed the users opinion about Company B Reddit objected to the subpoena including on First Amendment grounds and Company A filed a motion to compel Reddit to produce the users information Reddit fought the motion and the Court ruled that Reddit was not required to produce the users information How fucking crazy is it that a company actually tried to go to court over someone being critical of that company Is there any way for users to determine whether a request was made for information pertaining to their accountactivity The request of user account information seems to have gone up yeartoyear Do you feel it will continue that trend through  and beyond   request   request   request Hey uspez What exactly is an Emergency Disclosure Request Also  Request    A litigant issued a subpoena to Reddit seeking his or her own account information  Reddit advised that the user could request that Reddit provide them with their own information directly The litigant subsequently withdrew the subpoena lol Edit a word I have a question regarding the safeguards you have in place generally speaking when it comes to illegal content on Reddit Im not very fluent in the law but are you a mandatory reporter in that should illegal content be found on your site you are responsible for reporting it to the appropriate authorities If so how do you go about handling that Reddit is very large so Im assuming there would be automatic reporting If this is the case how do you reduce false positives If not how do you handle such a large load What is Reddits official position on providing user data to advertisers and other data aggregators What type of data and methods of data collection are considered fair game and which are currently in use  RealTime Monitoring Orders In  Reddit received one order to conduct realtime monitoring of the frequency of a Reddit users communications in the form of a Pen Register  Trap and Trace Order A pen register is a device or process which records or decodes dialing routing addressing or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted provided however that such information shall not include the contents of any communication     USC   Reddit complied with this order Someone really wants to figure out how Gallowboob can post as much as they do Any update on FA for accounts This whole talk about privacy reminded me I havent heard anything in a while If someone were to anonymously post the copyrighted recipe for mulan szechuan mcnugget sauce and you received a request from the copyright holder to take it down would you comply Reddit objected to the remaining  requests for the following reasons  Request   A litigant issued a subpoena to Reddit seeking his or her own account information  Reddit advised that the user could request that Reddit provide them with their own information directly The litigant subsequently withdrew the subpoena That one gave me a bit of a chuckle But maybe that poor soul was just pissed that theres still no data liberation tools of any sort that were talked about many years agohttpswwwredditcomrideasfortheadminscommentstaieverwonderedthedataliberationpolicyofredditcgicdf I guess subpoena counts as an offline system though LOL I know reddit admins sometimes take action though they wont say what when they encounter suicidal users on their platform I wish you would include whenif you notified authorities for those users in your transparency report I think it would be beneficial to see that deleted Thank you so much for taking part in the Facebook amicus brief earlier this year I knew one of  targeted users and the whole things reeked of BS Thanks for standing your ground The more transparency the better uspez thanks for posting this A question on the requests for user account information The number of requests went up from  requests to  which is quite a jump Why is it that these numbers increased so much from the previous year I know Reddit is growing in users but is it that much or are sites like Reddit being used as evidence more in court cases Out of curiosity is there any reason why so few of the requests for user account information from foreign countries were denied Not that I am complaining at all I like that the number is so low Of the  million users of this website it is quite impressive that only around  requests came in Do you expect these requests to continue rising over the years What can we as users do or know to have a better peace of mind when it comes to our privacy on Reddit Not necessarily looking for advice on VPNs or the other wonderful info available at rprivacy  Thanks again for the transparency and answering any questions you can Have a great day The post and subreddits were blocked from Turkish IPs Does anyone have links to posts that are blocked by country That seems like it would be interesting to see Request   A litigant issued a subpoena to Reddit seeking his or her own account information Reddit advised that the user could request that Reddit provide them with their own information directly The litigant subsequently withdrew the subpoena Hey bud you know you could just ask nicely  Turkey  We received  requests for the removal of one post and  subreddits which contained material that fell under the scope of obscenity in the Turkish Criminal Code which in turn constitutes grounds for a website to be blocked under the Turkish Internet Law The post and subreddits were blocked from Turkish IPs Can we get a list of the subs blocked in Turkey Edit I was PMd saying that r gayporn is blocked but going through other major subs I cant find any other ones Can we please get a reply on this one uspez Edit  I went through redditlistcoms nsfw list and checked like  more subs found  more r gaypornhunters and r twinks I see a pattern Edit  TurkeyBlocksorg articlehttpsturkeyblocksorglgbtisectionsdisappearasredditcomplieswithturkeycensorshiporders deleted How do you plan on improving communication with mods and general tools in the near future generally curious on what might be in store that would make our lives easier A company Company A issued a subpoena to Reddit seeking private account information about a user who made a post on Reddit that was critical of a company related to Company A Company B The post was based in fact and expressed the users opinion about Company B Reddit objected to the subpoena including on First Amendment grounds and Company A filed a motion to compel Reddit to produce the users information Reddit fought the motion and the Court ruled that Reddit was not required to produce the users information Wow that kinda shits really insane to me Good Guy Reddit deleted I find it hilarious that Russia and Turkey sent multiple requests for taking down content as if the duplicate requests were gonna make you guys change your minds Why when I look at reddit on my phone does it remind me every few days that I could be viewing a mobile version Why cant reddit take a hint the fiftieth time I decline Since Im working on making our monthly report for rpics now have you seen the small reports we write up each month I like these logs from reddit and hope reddit moderators like myself will start their own small scale efforts to increase transparency At home edit link to our February reporthttpswwwredditcomrpicscommentswzumfebruaryrpicstransparencyreport Question if hypothetically at some point I wanted to remove all my personal data from reddit is there any way to do so So far Ive seen scripts that automatically removeedit all your posts but is there anything else to make sure you guys remove the data from your servers Can it even be done or are you legally obligated to keep data a certain amount of time Thanks for keeping Reddit mostly anonymous thats the main reason I signed up Thanks for your hard work Now if only rpics and rfunny could be undefaulted How many tries did it take you to post this uspez Reddit is borking all over the place today Also no national security canary year as well as opposed to httpswwwredditstaticcomtransparencypdf It also disappeared last year For your reading pleasure on what all this meanshttpswwwredditcomrworldnewscommentsctkzredditdeletessurveillancewarrantcanaryin deleted Re the Section  case for which Reddit and others filed the amicus brief is there any more recent news about it I cant find anything since January but then it wouldnt surprise me if such things just move that slowly Section  is the reason the web as we know it exists and as a nonAmerican I am constantly disappointed that my own country is so happy to shoot itself in the foot by not having a similar law Australia but really it could be any other country So Im pretty keen to keep track of how that case progresses Im especially glad to see no request for information from the Indian government especially now that digital freedom of expression is such a hot topic Thank you for the disclosures No canary  uspez I am very happy and thankful that reddit releases these reports and fights for internet rights and transparency I have a small concern and Im sure you will be able to provide a satisfactory answer Earlier this year there was an incident involving the editing of reddit post data by superusers There was a lot of fallout but some users were concerned this kind of thing may happen again What steps has reddit taken or policies put in force that would deter such action in the future Understand again I do not mean to be critical I am only looking for an answer in the name of transparency and hope you do not take offense to my inquiry What is Reddit doing in the fight for Internet privacy in the light of recent ISP rulings Thanks for doing this What constitutes an emergency request Do you mean like someone is missing and the authorities want info on that persons account or is there more to it deleted uspez of all people Why dont you publish what everyone really wants to see Stats on rplace httpswwwredditcomrplacecommentsbbplacehasendeddfsbnq Can we please just have a filter that filters out all political subreddits rTheDonald doesnt annoy me because its Trump it annoys me because its politics I dont want other people shoving their political opinion down my throat The kind of political discussion that happens on Reddit is not the kind of political discussion I like engaging in rpolitics is stressful to read rTheDonald is stressful to read I want to wipe it all and click on cat pictures I come to Reddit to destress I have specific subreddits I go to for debate but I dont go to rall to find that kind of stuff I go to those subreddits If it werent for specific subreddits that give me things I cant find elsewhere on the Internet I would have quit Reddit by now The constant political anger just isnt worth it Political posts inevitably get more upvotes than they deserve because people upvote them for visibility  rather than because they like the post This is nice and all but it doesnt solve the problem It just means I have onesided political debate clogging up my feed rather than an rall which is free from that full stop So was rpopular an active subreddit before this or was it reserved ahead of time what subreddits are the ones that users consistently filter out So just to confirm the point of this is to basically have a SFW rall without those spam subreddits and no need to keep filtering new ones Good stuff Subbies not included in rPopular  Please reply here with subs I am missing A list from last weeks annoucementhttpsnpredditcomrmodnewscommentssghbintroducingpopularddewoh   rTheDonald  rEnoughTrumpSpam  rOverwatch  rGlobalOffensive  rleagueoflegends  rtrees  rDotA  rsoccer  rSandersForPresident So why still have people autosubscribed to the  defaults anymore If Im used to seeing rpopular as a logged out user then I would create a new account and instantly see an entirely different page than Im used to which is jarring Why not make rpopular the default for all newly created accounts from now forward and only change that or better yet have it be a toggleable option once they actually manually start subscribing to subs for themselves Im thinking that logged in users should have a nice visible switch at the top of their front page to toggle between popular and subscribed Then you can eliminate the whole concept of defaults entirely Edit To clarify it wouldnt automatically switch your front page to subscribed once you subscribed to anything It would stay as rpopular until you manually switched it Wheres rmildlypopular with posts with a few upvotes but not too many Why have default subreddits at all Why not just make rall function as rpopular  A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter out of their rall page So rtheDonald then Got it When will this be available to view for mobile users Im using the official iOS Reddit app and am unable to go to rpopular as it doesnt load Edit Same applies to the mobile browser version  the defaults have received a disproportionate amount of traffic and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit We therefore are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching rpopular which like rall opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page As I scroll down rpopular all I see are posts from subreddits with  subscribers How exactly does this allow for smaller subreddits to gain more traction  Over the years Reddit has grown up with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities each with enormous reach and great content Consequently the defaults have received a disproportionate amount of traffic and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit We therefore are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching rpopular which like rall opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page How exactly does this help new communities As far as I can tell its just rall a few subs While I like the move I think for transparencys sake itd be good to have a list of subs being filtered deleted How are posts eligible to show up popular First a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place Post from the following types of communities will not show up on popular NSFW and  communities Communities that have opted out of rall A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter out of their rall page So besides having enough votes to show up on the front page how are posts eligible to show up on popular Say I also want to get access to more diverse subs but dont want to sift through rall  is it possible to subscribe to rpopular and have it filter my subscribed subs automatically This would allow me to have the occasional crop of new subs seep through and broaden my horizons while still maintaing the core of my feed So now we just need runpopular should still be NSFW free cause of reasons Finally anyone can be popular Will it be possible to selectively choose which subs are filtered out I love the idea of a clean rall with less politics and low quality content but Im a gamer and Id like to also browse subs like roverwatch and rglobaloffensive both of which were filtered out of the popular list Will I be able to include posts from subs that didnt make the popular list in my rpopular EDIT Also Some subs specific to certain games were included in the list rCitiesSkylines But it appears that some of the most active gaming subs are not included rleagueoflegends rglobaloffensive roverwatch rRainbow rDotA rhearthstone etc Is it possible that game specific subs with less activity rCitiesSkylines rzelda are included in rpopular because they dont show up on rall enough for people to bother with filtering them deleted   What is thishttpspastebincomGuViF What is the purpose of rPopular It seems like it is essentially rAll but the Admins and Reddit at large are now just editorializing what they want users to see Better yet its done with no transparency Thus we are seeing what the Admins with some unknown filters applied see as Popular Seems fucking stupid to be quite honest  A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter out of their rall page will not be included coughtdcough Why not release the list of subreddits banned from rpopular Will rpopular change its filtered list periodically I dont like seeing rpolitics in my feed and had to filter it out of rpopular because this new algorithm seems to favor it being on the front page more than in the past If enough people filter controversial subreddits like rpolitics will it become removed from the rpopular site for everyone Im on mobile and rall does not show up Pls fix A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter Is this abuseable Can large subreddits coordinate their users to individually filter out other subreddits causing them to be added the popular filter I dont see the point of have any politically themed subs in rpopular A lot of users are outside of the US and all of the political subs are in some way narrowly sided Is there a graph of the most filtered out subreddits Rpolitics should absolutely not be on here It is just as politically biased as the campaign subs In fact I think we should take all the political ones off of rpopular All you have to do is filter out rpolitics and rthedonald and the front page for non logged in users will be  more enjoyable I was excited for about  seconds until I loaded up rpopular and the top  posts were from rpolitics and rmarchagainsttrump Come on do what you said you were going to do This should be a move to make reddit bearable not just filter down to the opinions you want to push deleted Ah so a place where you can filter out all the stuff you dont want to hear or see Got it now the illusion of rpolitics threads being the collective opinion of every reddit user is complete all other voices are filtered out automatically Time for the shitstorm about subreddits listed as consistently filtered to begin TIL rpolitics is not a consistently filtered subreddit  Remove all political subreddits from rpopular  This would beneif nonAmericans redditors Ive seen nonAmericans redditors complain about American political crap which is a valid complaint As an American if Reddit was based in another country I wouldnt want to see their political crap either so I understand how they feel  This would be a simple way for people to ONLY see political subreddits they want to see A person could visitadd rpopular then visitadd specific political subreddits they care about  goes to rpopular rpolitics link is above the fold Nope rpolitics isnt filtered out Um This doesnt seem to work If I may make a suggestion Add all political subs to the ban list Will the list change if people en masse take a sub out of their filter Can you instead filter out all the subreddits that are plagued by onesided political circlejerks Every subreddit on my rall shitlist is there because theyve been taken over by one American political ideology or another and as a nonAmerican reddit user Im tired of seeing all the political bullshit especially now that your election is long over Reddit admins please filter out all of these subreddits from rpopular and maybe you will have an actual good feature that will be conductive to positive user experiencehttpimgurcomHPOTLb EDIT This is just my shitlist and is far from comprehensive My point is rpopular should not include any subreddit that doesnt enforce antipolitics rules rvideos and their strict enforcement of R is a perfect example of a sub that does this well and should be a model for subs that should be included on rpopular Oh God the first two links are from rMarchAgainstTrump and rpolitics Please let us filter things in rpopular Ok so if Im getting this straight this is really a feature aimed at new users considering you stated What will this change for logged in users Nothing and if thats the case I think it would only make sense to bar off all political subreddits If someone is interested in discussing politics they can do the small amount of leg work to create an account and seek out those communities When you dont bar off political subreddits you are likely going to turn away half of the people who are interested and retain only those who agree with what they read This creates more of a polarization in your user base and widens the gap of difference between the users which is really bad for a forum that is meant to encourage discussion Another big concern I have is in regard to an issue Ive noticed with the implementation of the filter feature I love the ability to filter out content that I dont want to read but often times especially with the political subreddits you see new ones being created as a way to get around the filter People create a new sub or use one that has a very small community or little to no activity and mass upvote a post on it to get it on rall The way I see this being a problem with rpopular is that right now rpopular is essentially from my understanding an SFW version of rall with admin decided filters Could a sub that is filtered not just create a new community and do this same practice To finish up here I have two things to say  Theres no way that you didnt forsee a ton of questions about why rpolitics is not filtered out but unless I missed it you dont address this concern that so many people in the comments have been expressing I understand that you said the subs that get filtered on rpopular are based on a handful of subreddits taht users constantly filter out of their rall page but it seems difficult to believe that rpolitics is not heavily filtered What would help is if you released statistics on which subs are most filtered or not or otherwise found a way to be transparent about this situation  I would dwindle down the number of default subs there are It can be a little overwhelming Perhaps just have a handful of defaults that are more generalized eg music askreddit ama and then let people choose more based on interests such as gaming nature politics photography readingwriting music etc Right now it seems like suddenly thrusting  communities upon a new user can be a little overwhelming Please just change this to a page where there are no political subreddits Go to the popular page top posts by hour DOMINATED by rpolitics How is this creating a way for new nascent communities to compete with the larger more established This all seems like a ploy to me Probably to distract us from the fact that in  The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted  ft through an announcers table  ITT why is my brigading trolling subreddit that everybody hates not in rpopular  A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter out of their rall page AKA Anything that goes against out personnel views Congratulations only a few hours after you institute rpopular it already gets topped by a focused political subreddit that hasnt even existed for more than  days and has a tiny sub count This is a complete joke httpimgurcomaDNoyl deleted deleted Sounds like a crappy way to have an admin created AI show me what the admins think is popular content You could have modified rall to be a better rpopular with just a few minor tweaks One toggle to showhide NSFW communities Even that could default or be locked off for loggedout users Better filtering Why do I have to filter rblackpeopletwitter rwhitepeopletwitter and rbikinibottomtwitter How about letting rtwitter do it all Add another operation like rtrump or rhillary and get a whole bunch of wildcards filtered out If anything what is needed is rrelated A sub that uses community meta tags to display top content from subs with the same tags So eg someone subscribe to rcats meta cats will get a ton of rstartledcats raww and MM others Last a combination filter of the two So rcars filters out any sub meta tagged with car related posts  And now that Ive had a day to browse rpopular I can make a more objective comment about it It sucks It doesnt consider community size when judging popularity Ill never browse the popular screen Its just a vehicle to display all the top posts from the default subs and a couple other extremely large popular subreddits that the admins didnt add to the excluded ie stuff admins hate list ie a screen to deliver a lot of the shit I filtered off my rall page Can we please get rPolitics off of rpopular It tends to be just as bipartisan and annoying as all the other politics subreddits that were targeted and just as annoying to see on the front page If youre going to filter all the conservative politics subs off this page thats fine but please do the same for the liberal ones as well so we can just have a nicer site lol of course rpolitics is in there This isnt a very good thing If you had an algorithm that decided what to block and what not to block then I would understand but the fact that rpolitics is still on rpopular is proof that youve handpicked the blocked subreddits This means that you now have a way to control what nearly all of your users see while being able to tell any who oppose the idea that they can just browse rall instead knowing that very few people are engaged enough to know or even care that thats an option I like the premise but the way you went about doing this is giving yourself far too much power over what your viewers see Its not quite censorship but its pretty darn close Oh thank god Nothing more embarrassing than telling people about this great new site they havent heard of called Reddit then a few days later having to explain no you can filter the subreddits and not make it total shit Its crazy how rpopular is far worse than rall now It has more antitrump leftist garbage then rall Good job guys What a fucking joke So filtering doesnt work on rpopular at all I have rpolitics filtered through RES and the regular website itself and  of the popular  last hour content in rpopular is all from rpolitics Amusingly enough its worse than during the leadup to the election There are SEVENTEEN posts from that shitreddit on the top for the last hour Thats why I filtered them in the first place I used to hit the top page for the last hour to see whats new And it updates all the bloody time Now its fucked Both on rall and rpopular So adding the ability to filter specific subreddits out of rpopular might be something you guys want to look through Otherwise its going to become rpoliticslite Heres a list of politically biased subs that are on rpopular  rMarchAgainstTrump resist rBlueMidterm rDrumpf rpolitics Thats only after looking through the st page just filled with antiTrump left leaning subs This just once again shows the admins have a political agenda Cant this system be gamed to censor certain subreddits  Find subreddit you dont like  Create army of bots or encourage your community to filter that subreddit from rall en masse   It will not take long and they will delete rall mark my words and rpolitics is not commonly excluded Yeah ok man rpolitics post is on the top of rpopular You cant convince me that rpolitics isnt a highly filtered sub Why isnt that garbage sub filtered out Why is rmarchagainsttrump allowed If you cut out some specialized political subs please cut them all out I know rpolitics is theoretically neutral and not taken out but these antitrump subs are absurd now If TD goes so should these other ones I would say that if you want this to not be editorialized then you should remove rpolitics and other subs that lean heavily in only one direction Otherwise its just more filtering of subs that dont meet the admins approval and lets face it you guys are well known for censoring subs that arent leftist In regards to rPolitics Im a Liberal and this shit has gone on long enough even for me Its clearly not even attempting to hide its Left leaning Bias A sub with the heading title of POLITICS should have Impartiality as a TOP priority I used to come to Reddit for news and still do when major events happen around the world Its more up to date than the media and you can get pics words and updates from people actually there without any blue or red lens and a patronising anchor I know its all the rage to forget that impartiality is a key part of our democracy these days but that doesnt make it any less true The only people being hurt by this are the sane Conservatives and Liberals who would rather hear either a combination of both points of view or ideally an impartial one As it stands rpolitics absolutely fails in this regard Those mods should hang their heads in fucking shame Like many others around today they are giving Liberalism a bad name Edit Wow ok this blew up a bit Thank you for the gold kind stranger x Yes this is an alt account Yes I am indeed a Liberal All I can give you is my word so take it as you may My eyes are dark brown too if you really need to know Having a Liberal majority userbase is not the issue its the control over what that user base is exposed to and the best way to enforce impartiality is to simply not enforce a bias Centrists please dont feel alone I feel we are still the majority We just lack competent leadership and people are getting a little crazy right now in its absence Clever way to get those sweet rpolitics propaganda posts back to the top of the default frontpage I find it disappointing for a few reasons  Political subreddits  why include these at all rpolitics is basically an article format of renoughtrumpspam rimpeachtrump is obvious  Specific game subreddits  either include the popular ones or dont include them at all rforhonor rwow and rhearthstone are included in popular but rleagueoflegends and rscape arent  Same with sports  rsoccer is not included  Algorithm seems just as shitty as it has been for the past two years when I select rpopular I keep being redirected to rpolitics edit httpiimgurcompcFWBnJpng rpopular is worthless if rpolitics isnt filtered usimbawulf you need to poll how many Redditors want politics removed from rpopular I can already hear rthedonald raging that this is somehow a conspiracy against them deleted So basically its like making rpolitics a default sub again while simultaneously censoring rthedonal  got it GET RID OF ALL THE POLITICAL ONES FROM POPULAR There shouldnt be Any form of politics on popular Unless rpolitics is filtered from rpopular this will obviously be a source of ridicule for reddits admins usimbawulf and uspez you guys fucked up plain and simple attempting to facilitate the white washing of decent news I use this instead of goodbiasedpropaganda ect Yes this site is exponentially bigger and wilder than you could have imagined but that should not mean sacrifices to the integrity of my own choices You dont get to tell me I can have it one way then backtrack after you see its not what is best for your team Mainstream media is doing this and getting dumped in favor of alternative media ie podcastsreddit like platforms YouTube stars When you commit the same actions as the mainstream media that we forcefully pried from our lives you are doomed to fail People in general dont like subterfuge your teams abundant use of it shows your lack of caring for actual freedoms You should be ashamed of your actions  Yeah popular why not just use rpropaganda  Why cant I access rpopular on the mobile app Thank you for making me my own sub  Finally the recognition I deserve If you guys filter out nsfw and  subreddits why is there amateur porn on my popular feed wait why the hell is rpolitics on rpopular D Edit And WTF and Political Humor This cant go well What an absolutely bullshit of a sub Without filtered rpolitics its just propaganda version of rall if yall will make rpopular not have rpolitics then it would work A handful of subreddits that users consistently filter out of their rall page So people dont filter out rpolitics or is that an exception This honestly would have been great if you just did it the way you described instead of keeping the spammy political subs you agree with and blocking the rest Diverse content my ass you liar And yet rpolitics is still there Shocking  In all honesty rPolitics is probably the worst spammy sub on here that does nothing more than promote anything negative against Trump Its not about politics anymore because there is hardly any actual political discussion that happens there outside of whatever adds to the echos and the ONLY time you do find differing opinions is when you are forced to sort the thread by controversial Im all for TD not being on there but the spam that comes from rPolitics is just as annoying and stupid as rEnoughTrumpSpam rAntiTrumpAlliance rImpeachTrump rTheDonald etc etc etc deleted Sounds good Ive never been much interested in rall because it seems to always have content from the same old subreddits and narrowly focused politically related subreddits   hours ago by simbawulf so please tell me how is rpolitics not narrowly focused politically related subreddit Go take a look at it Its  liberal anti Trump article spam Okay I can believe that TD is being constantly filtered out But you want me to believe TwoXChromosomes isnt as much Or other politics subreddits Polish digglike website Wykop yet the biggest social news aggregator just filtered out EVERYTHING that is political and puts an  on anything that is NSFW  that way they cant be accused for taking sides in politics or whatever New users dont see politics UNLESS they tick it out from their settings What you did was filtering NSFW and TDlike subreddits out of the feed  thats the only difference from rall as far as I can see If you want to be perceived as neutral webpage Id suggest you go the same way rather than take ANY side in this I think reddit is pulling a fast one here there should really only be these three views rall  absolutely no filtering or of any kind literally the most trending posts of any and all subreddits Default landing site rpopular  just like rall by default but with the ability to filter specific subreddits or groups of subreddits all political all sport etc accessible without signing in Subscribed  just like rall but only subscribed subreddits The notion of default subreddits and Reddit deciding what most people should or shouldnt see is very telling SoYou use rpolitics as a sample of what will be on there and then say spam will be cutUhh nope The fact that rpolitics isnt one of the excluded subreddits really says a lot about how biased the admins are Could we maybe get the statistics on which subreddits are filtered consistently Please remove rpolitics from rpopular What part of the current Reddit population are you intending on losing with this additionshift Have you accounted for the fact that these moves may come across as censorship and may cause users to go to less moderated sites Why isnt rpolitics filtered out too They have almost as many annoying posts as rTheDonald Get rid of rpolitics you fucks Oh cool guess Ill go check it out aaaaaaaaand weve already drawn a giant dick I just put a blue dot down and now someone put a pink dot next to mine For some reason this was the most special thing to happen to me this week Okay I placed a block Now I will proceed to completely forget about this thing only remembering when people post screenshots of the various penises and

thishttpbpblogspotcomUyWfKbUdzoUadknIacWIAAAAAAAAGhwKqYVyqzQWAUsmegamangunpixelartpng at  if anyone would like to help Edit Now at  there was a site that i saw in a VSauce video that did something similar a huge text editor i dont even think that it had an end it just generated more space as further down you scroll and everybody could type realtime it was SO BEAUTIFUL to follow a line that somebody drew all the way down you could read all the thoughts that other people had like where does this line end and is there even somebody reading this it had something magic then i found a girl that made some bunny footprints i dont know if it was a girl but she wrote her name once in a while and it sounded pretty girly and it was so cute how you had to scroll for hours to follow the path of the bunny and she build him castles and forrests and all that stuff with some dashes  and underlines  and some of these things  it was like a little fairy tail but a few hours long after a few hours of scrolling i think it was h i found the end of the bunny footprints and saw how she was working on new footprints to continue the bunny adventure i started writing with her while she was doing more footprints and she answered after every few footsprints it was so romantic and beautiful i kinda fell in love with a person that i didnt know anything about just because the whole scenario was so unreal we were somewhere in an infinite texteditor where the chance to scroll down for hours and find somebody writing stuff is pretty small and we were kinda alone and we wrote in the middle of the night while she was doing bunny footprints come on hollywood there is potential for a movie then i had to sleep i never followed the bunny path down the text editor again because that would mean that i had to scroll for h again i probably could have open the websites source code and change a paramether to skip all the scrolling but im not smart enough for that kind of stuff if you read that bunnyperson i miss you you and your beautiful bunny castles that enlighted my night in the darkness of the infinite texteditor edit the site was called httpwwwyourworldoftextcom Im not ready for this

every announcement turns into TD complaining about how theyre so oppressed lol So is this dropping defaults completely then deleted Ive already managed to snipe one of these and subscribed to animals being jerks To unsub I have to go to the subreddit and do it there Feature request A second Click of the check mark that appears after subscribing unsubscribes you from that sub Is there an easy undo button if I accidentally click on it It seems like a hassle to unsubscribe from something if you screw up and have to load the subreddit up to unsubscribe I like it but I REALLY dislike that  icon its really distracting The worst part is that subs youre not subscribed to are in bold and in a darker shade of blue bringing your eyes to the subreddit name instead of the rest of the post Edit thanks for the gold and have a nice day anonymous  I felt a great disturbance in the defaults as if millions of mods suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced Too bad nonEnglish speaking country subs are now no longer geodefaulted theyll hardly ever show up on popular nor are they included in the discovery tool So rtheNetherlands after our Canadian friends the biggest country sub on reddit goes from automatic subscriptions to being completely invisible to new dutch users You know what kills user experience Horrible search Ive been on reddit for way to long and I can never find crap deleted Can I turn off the subscribe button I find them intrusive theres a reason Im not subscribed to those subs Oh and theyre on rall too Can we have a minus button to filter the subs I dont want to see some foreign language subs or rpeoplefuckingdying etc The  was rapidly taken up by porn and political subs Can we please get more than  exclusions from rall at least for reddit gold members Feel free to look at my exclusions  they fall into a few major categories sports memes etc but there are so many subreddits popping up for each that I cant exclude them all with only  exclusions Really subreddit categoriestags would be far better so I could exclude NBA team subreddits instead of excluding them individually Thanks for this update usimbawulf At a little more granular level am I correct in my understanding of the current flow of information UserLanding if directed to wwwredditcomLanding if directed to wwwredditcomrpopularLanding if directed to wwwredditcomrall  No Accountrpopularrpopularrall Brand new userNew user tutorial page to guide to subscribe to at least  subredditrpopularrall User subscribed to at least  subredditReddit home as it is now that shows a multireddit of up to  subreddits they are subscribed to at a timerpopularrall Will rall still be a thing but not advertised I dont see it in the top bar as shown Many years ago we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site Strange Ive been here  years mostly surfing logged out to avoid the echo chamber effect and the quality of content of the front page is the same trash we used to make fun of ifunny and all those other vapid sites for So Ive tried to combat that by falling into my echo chamber I tried to avoid  the thing is it seems like the new users in those subs came to reddit for the shitposts that cover rpopular and now there is a real quality issue in subs that have always attracted people that want to read a long article learn something just for the sake of learning or any of those things with more substance than a jpeg of a frog with some text overlaid over it Let me be clear this is not a response to reddit being hyperpoliticized I personally see value in it and am stimulated by it this is purely a response to the very apparent change of feel to the site I understand if your target market has changed so will you just be clear with us is the goal of this site just to produce the most clicks now or is there still some interest in being an effective and efficient online information sharing community or honestly any care to what kind of community you are creating Where do I put my Status Guys END THE USER PROFILE THING Wonder how this will affect subs that have been relying on the karma from being default without trying to moderate in a way that encourages quality content Looking at you rpics rgaming rfunny etc I might ask is there any chance that spammy political subs will be taken off of rpopular to make the browsing experience a little more Tolerable So one the one hand this is neat Hopefully it will be an improved experience for users allowing them to find the right niche on the site On the other though Id like to raise a major concern I have from the Moderation end namely regarding views and visitors This is potentially a HUGE change in traffic patterns for many subreddits and as abouttraffic remains broken Mods dont have a good way to track that impact The implementation of Views on threads is a start but short of painstaking manual tabulation that serves little use for a macro view of traffic changes This has been a known issue for a long time and I have heard in the past that it is being worked on but there has been no explicit timetable on the fix and it very disappointing to see something like this get rolled out before traffic monitoring for moderators is working properly So when will abouttraffic be working properly Whats with the adshttpiimgurcomOiOiRApng How long until you enforce the vote manipulation rule Day old subs with  subscribers keep using bots to push posts to the front page to bypass filters and not a peep had been said by the admins about it Damn there goes my dream of rIsItButter becoming a default as it rightly deserved Can we expect filtering from rpopular anytime soon The million antitrump subs are just as terrible as the Trump subs at this point please make it easier to filter out subs from rpopular im so tired of having to constantly see hitler and school shooting memes Will Reddit ever implement any transparency for subreddit modding Currently a mod can delete and censure any opinion they disagree with and claim that theyve never deleted anything Will a subreddit log of deleted comments and banned users ever be available Why is there admin feedback on every top comment except the ones regarding political spamming of rall and the censorship by rTwoXChromosomes So new users will think this site is an antiTrump circlejerk or a prowhite nationalist circlejerk Awesome The default subreddit rTwoXChromosomes recently implemented a mass banwave of users if they posted on other subreddits the TwoX mods dont approve of This is a direct violation of reddits community rules httpsnpredditcomrCommunityDialoguecommentsirwqsohereswhatsreallyreallyreallygoingon All attempts at communication with admins regarding this issue has yielded no reply Can we get some form of acknowledgement that the admins are aware of this issue nbsp EDIT more detailshttpsnpredditcomrRedditCensorscommentscmpwrtwoxchromosomesproactivelybanningagain How do we get spacedicks to the top And suddenly s of default mods just cried out in pain Excellent The best way to kill the toxicity of the default subs is to get rid of default subs I think this is a step in the right direction but the emphasis on subreddit signups on rpopular tells me that reddit is stuck on an old and I believe incorrect model of site usage Ill explain For loggedout and new users you want to present your best guess for what subreddits an average user will want to see Landing on rpopular is exactly the right thing users see every subreddit except those that want to be filtered and those that users filter above some rate Using blacklists instead of a whitelist plays to reddits strength the amazing variety of communities Another strength of reddit is the rate at which novel communities form and rpopular allows viewers to see new communities as soon as they become popularwithout admin intervention This leaves what subbreddits to show loggedin users Without user intervention this should still be rpopular after all its your best guess and you dont have any extra information yet Right now the model appears to be  sign up  while browsing rpopular subscribe to lots of subreddits  switch to redditcom at some point This has the same problems for loggedin users that the old frontpage had for nonloggedin users even with dozens of subscriptions it only covers a fraction of the site and it doesnt react well to new community development It also creates a huge barrier to entry creating a decent subreddit collection might take dozens or hundreds of clicks I think a better model is to encourage users to begin with a good starting point rpopular and then gradually modify it to fit their tastes by adding and removing subreddits Adding is a nobrainer a users subscription to a sitewidefiltered subbreddit should cause it to show up on rpopular for them anyway Subtraction presumably requires more work but I think it should be a core reddit feature Subreddit filtering should be promoted to the same prominence and usability as subreddit subscription the same list should filter both rall and rpopular it shouldnt be limited to just  entries and it should have the same UI as for subscription a filter button both beneath each post on rpopular and on each subreddit page and a central page to manage a users filtered subreddits In this model subscribe links beneath each post on rpopular arent nearly as useful theres never a reason to switch to redditcom so subscription does nothing to subreddits a user is already seeing on rpopular TLDR Im proposing the following model  New users go to rpopular before and after signup  Users remove subreddits from their rpopular by filtering from links below each post on rpopular  Users add sitewidefiltered subreddits to their rpopular by subscribing from links on the subreddits homepages Can someone explain to me the purpose of rpopular As far as I can tell it acts as a strictly worse rall Its rall minus the customization and by having some subreddits that might interest you like league of legends fex off by default If you had a better search functionality you could ask them what they like and then recommend to them subreddits based on those likes The  limit on subreddits you can filter is far far too low Does the tutorial page have a yesno option for if youre just creating yet another porn alt so you can be directed to quality NSFW subs instead of having to sift through all this other junk Insert question about FA here about time Isnt rpopular just reddit without thedonald Holy fuck rpics and rfunny are finally undefaulted I never thought Id live to see this day From my point of view rpopular is evil Too bad popular has been spammed by dozens of filter evading subs These subs pop up and are pushed to the top by bots faster than they can be removed The inline subscription buttons are also on rall is this intended They are very distracting and overwhelming doesnt fit in with the style of the page Please unbold it removed The BOLD is far too much for the inline subscription buttons on rall or rpopular It draws your eye more than even the submission titles themselves Please tone it back significantly or better yet give options to customize how it looks deleted because TD runs scripts to exploit comment history in an effort to threaten doxxing  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk rpopular is reddits censored sub how big was your sample size for extremely positive results Fucking finally no more US politics spam when I open reddit Will people who are already signed up be grandfathered in and still have all the defaults subbed to So this is how the defaults dies with thunderous applause Love it Love it But alright Ill ask Can we get a popular for NSFW subreddit For research this would be a version of popular for only NSFW subreddits not a combination of both Will the in line subscription buttons work on the mobile app Well shit this explains so much Im subscribed to so many subs I have no memory of signing up for This is great news Good subs have gone bad because they became defaults and others never should have been defaults in the first place because of divisivespecialized subject matter This is really cool But I have a question is it possible for us already existing users to unsubscribe from the earlier default subs or do we have to do it manually ourselves The inline subscription buttons are REALLY obnoxious on rall They really pop out more than anything else on the page Hi My problem with rpopular is that there are a lot of low quality subreddits and clone of thems There are like multiple subreddit about animals For example I want to read more quality subreddit science programming etc But popular subreddit at least most of them are gifs images and memes The subscribe buttons and bolding in the list is way too strong Its distracting You need to tone it back down Doesnt needed to be darkbolded Reddit should add a feature when signing up that says something like what are your interests you type in sports favourite bands movies games etc and the site recommends subreddits based off your interests to get you started Would be cool to showcase unpopular but devoted subs that dont have a lot of foot traffic but have consistent postings You had to do this a few hours after I signed up and unsubscribed from almost all of them didnt you yeah but when will you fix the search bar Create a politics tag like spoilers or NSFW and require all politically related posts to use it so I can filter them please Suggestion  add an import from other account feature for people wanting to play around with alternate accounts but dont want to resubscribe to all their favorite subs CTRLFd to see how many instances of Trump I could find in this wasnt disappointed Its my new game  I find a post that has nothing to do with Trump and see how many times Trump pops up then I drink I developed cirrhosis of the liver exactly  months ago  I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of power hungry controlfreak moderators suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced I fear something terrible has happened ObiWan Seasoning So I dont have to keep unsubscribing from twoxchromosomes every time I make a new account now This look really cool A couple of questions  Will the subscribe buttons only show on actual unsubscribed subreddits I know there was a bug with user profiles where it wasnt accurate because of the  sub limit for the page  Will previous default subs be considered subscribed automatically Or do we have to subscribe to them manually now  Can you add rDCFU to the recommendations in the tutorial page Im asking for a friend of coursehttpiimgurcomXJEpqvgifv Interesting Id like to see how this changes the reddit experience for the positive and the negative This is coming from a default mod though As a default mod its been a pleasure Its hysterical how the admins arent replying to any of the top comments asking if anti trump subreddits will be filtered out but will reply to a comment thats newer and is all the way at the bottom How do you verify whether a for instance gonewild post is actually voluntary or if its a different person posting images without permission Subreddits like rdoppelbangher had consensual porn between licensed actors Why has it been banned just curious Can you explain why they were the same rule to begin with and what lead you to split it into two rules Clarification request Pornography created legitimately with a model release and distributed under a Free content license Someone posts it to reddit without the performerss permission Is this a violation If the poster is or is not the producer of the content If the performer does or does not explicitly ask for its removal including fantasy content eg stories anime So all hentai subs will be shut down Because  of hentai portrays people who look too young  or someone who appears to be a minor This wording includes a good number of  year old pornstars Piper Perry Emily Bloom and Lucy Li come to mind Will posts containing younglooking porn stars be removed TLDR One of our subreddits hit the mainstream news and is getting negative publicity This hurts our bottom line so we are banning it What about images of dead babiescorpses and harming animals on rnomorals NSFL warning   subscribers and counting Edited to add Reddits content policy  Do not post violent content  httpswwwreddithelpcomencategoriesrulesreportingaccountandcommunityrestrictionsdonotpostviolentcontent  Do not post content that encourages glorifies incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people likewise do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals We understand there are sometimes reasons to post violent content eg educational newsworthy artistic satire documentary etc so if youre going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear If you dont want these things on your site thats fine its your site but dont lie about why you are removing them If you wanting a more welcoming environment youd get rid of the sub Reddits of dead animals and fights You just are jumping on the celebrity faked porn bandwagon so you cant be held accountable and the fact that more and more people are hating on anime because it sexualizes teenage fictional characters Its ok if you want to get these off your site but dont lie about why anime Man faces  years in prison for downloading Simpsons pornhttpsnewsavclubcommanfacesyearsinprisonfordownloadingsimpsonsp Author Neil Gaiman had one of the best responses to the  case saying that the court had just inadvertently granted human rights to cartoon characters and that the ability to distinguish between fiction and reality is I think an important indicator of sanity perhaps the most important And it looks like the Australian legal system has failed on that score It remains to be seen how a US court will react during Kutzners January  sentencing In the meantime if you value your own job resist the temptation to Google Simpsons porn right now Or if you do stick to the HomerandMarge stuff we guess What if its involuntary pornography over  anime characters Its not my thing nor Neil Gaimans apparantly but I cannot see the common sense in some reddit rules treating fictional characters as real people and not others Im all for protecting minors but that policy is SO broad that it comes down to basically admin discretion which is a recipe for disaster Is Harry Potter fan art of Ginny kissing Harry fully clothed now sexualizing minors Even if its just an illustration of an actual scene in the book Teens have sexuality and its not wrong to write and read about it otherwise you need to burn all copies of Judy Blume and the many many MANY other fictional depictions of teen sexual awakenings and romances As written here the policy is so broad that it could be interpreted to ban this kind of content Seems like something that exists but will not be enforced For example probably half of all anime has some sort of sexualization suggestive content of anime girls under  most likely more You may as well just delete ranime in its entirety if these new rules were actually enforced I feel this is going to be like how self promotion work Where technically its in the rules but  is overlooked EDIT ranime mods have confirmed they are aware of new rules and are attempting to work with admins for clarification so they can apply new rule to their sub So when should ranime and all its related subreddits expect to be shut down Its so ingrained in Japanese media that unless youre watching a shounen geared specifically towards the western audience you have a  chance to see something the rules now prohibit you from talking about And even then the chance is still very present Typical pr bullshit Theres subreddits for dead corpses and animal abuse but because thats not in the news theyre allowed to continue and entertain the sick individuals who go there on the regular Deepfakes was cool but i didnt see any underage or potential cp on there obvs if there was the posts should have been removed Ultimately Spez and co dont give a fuck about making Reddit a more welcoming place otherwise they would ban numerous other subreddits that incite violence or show abuse or vulgar images of people andor animals Also theres plenty of other fakes subreddits that havent been banned yet They just wanted to remove anything that could make them liable as it was involving celebrities and getting national attention  want to make Reddit a more welcoming environment for all users Ill take bullshit for  Alex Yikes posting anime content is going to be tricky uh Whats next banning games that promote murder There is a huge difference between fantasy and real life watching anime doesnt make you a pedophile just the same way playing video games doesnt turn you into a sociopath I know rule creation is hard but I feel like reddit admins like to play in the gray area of rule creation too often With that in mind I need some clarification on what is or isnt involuntary pornography Both of these were reported recently as such What say you reddit admins  httpswwwredditcomrJoeRogancommentsvbarcthisistheidealmalebodyyoumaynotlikeit  httpswwwredditcomrJoeRogancommentsvllikeadoctahnsfw With the rule being so subjective will mods that ignore involuntary pornography reports from users because weve deemed it to not be involuntary be punished for doing so Your definition of involuntary pornography is way too loose if you include faked shit By that logic you might as well ban rphotoshopbattles since none of the people in those pictures consented to being photoshopped either Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor  including fantasy content eg stories anime Lets light a candle for our fallen brothers  ranime ranimeirl ranimemes  My stance on this I dont particularly support it but it is a drawing after all No one gets hurt from it even if its creepy and weird Theres a difference between imaginationfantasy and real life Most people have had some weird fantasies before in their life but that doesnt mean that theyre going to act on them in real life or that theyre mentally ill Something that helps separate this fantasy and real life apart even more is that lolis prepubescent characters in mainstream anime look and act nothing like actual children Child pornography harms children while these lolis only harm the social life of the person watching it Ah good I was just thinking the other day that its been too long without the Mods rolling out another rule theyll never properly enforce just to stifle some bad press I was getting worried about you guys I got banned from rredditrequest for trying to get an admin who was working in there to remove some revenge porn that reddit was hosting for over a year it was used as a background of a sub dedicated to the victim I followed him around and kept replying to his posts and got banned but nothing was done until I called raldi former admin and asked him to do something Please note the victim was IGNORED by admins for a year before I took action So how about you unban me from there and show me how much you care about revenge porn edit plural typo Im all for the rule change but it sure smells like a bullshit cover to avoid bad PR from rdeepfakes If you guys actually care about enforcing this rule why didnt you ban any of the other yearsold communities that clearly fall under this rule such as rcelebfakes or rfuxtaposition deleted Welcome to an Admin shitpost Where sorting by controversial does nothing How is CP policed through the subredditslike what happens if something is questionableon the fence I would hope the rule would be remove first then allow but with verification Banning subs for peoples weird fetishes about celebrities because its creepy and the bad possible implications of AI but dont ban hate speech dont ban the promotion of violence dont ban the promotion of stealing I guess thats what happens when Pornhub PR makes you look bad I rarely ever post on here anyway except for comments but Im curious Would involuntary pornography include a drawing someone made of someone else For example I have a very graphic picture saved on my phone that someone had drawn of Trump and Putin giving each other hand jobs Would that fall under involuntary pornography Looks like Reddit is preparing to become a more marketable social media network Cleaning up and clarifying your TOS in preparation of a big product strategy shift is pretty common in the tech world You need something to cover your ass when you attempt to change user behavior and expectations after having spent years convincing them this was the place for them to be I wish them well but well see how Reddit manages to execute on this pursuit of advertiser friendliness Maybe they wont make Reddit into the emptycarbs brandfriendly buzzfeedpowered content platform but given thats where the money is Maybe Im too pessimistic  this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor or someone who appears to be a minor do not post it while the good intentions for these  lines are fairly benign it creates a fairly easy system to systematically ban anything for any reason if a child is involved the legal student in me begs for clarification and concision These PR attempts are getting predictable You only gave a damn because crappy clickbait sites like The Verge hammered away at deepfakes Now they get to write more articles about their battles for Societys morals and their defense of Hollywoods shitterati Meanwhile truly vile subs like nomorals and arguably worse ones to actively exploit women are just fine even after being complained about Just fuck off Spineless PR bullshit If you wanted to ban deepfakes to avoid negative press just do it without this theatre And of course youre not going to answer any of the upvoted questions around it specifically Its completely legal to Photoshop things or fake picturesvideos as long they arent presented as real and no profit is made It was a niche sub and no more unwelcoming than hundreds other nsfw subs   Reddit prohibits the dissemination of images or video depicting any person in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct apparently created or posted without their permission Does mean that xrated subreddits will no longer exist because there is no way to prove they were posted with permission Im thinking of things like hold the moan realgirls etc  giving human rights to fictional characters You need to be psychologically evaluated for this decision I think you have trouble discerning between reality and fiction Heres some stuff that may surprise you Star Wars didnt actually happen dont worry there arent a billion zombies walking around outside your office eating humanity and there isnt a supernatural notebook which kills people based on their names being written in it Holy shit This thread basically turned into I dont like this sub please ban it and the admins actually are Some of these should have been banned long ago but the deepfake stuff Whats going on here Are we allowed to just ban any old sub now This is a pretty slippery slope Obviously cracking down on child pornnudity is great but the fact that this extends to animegamesfantasy is questionable We seriously need to learn the difference between fictional charactersdrawings and actual real people Characters dont have feelings there is no consent because they arnt real This is pretty much the whole video games make people violent bullshit all over again Someone looking at loli shit isint going to make them a pedo we shouldnt try to keep arguing that fictional characters are real and should be protected Hmmmmm A few days ago you ban subreddit that have stayed rational and civil but have naughty written stories and today you come out with this rule You havent even banned subreddits which do the most harm Fuck off with this more welcoming bullshit Ever time you twats make a PR move I want to shit on my phone because thats basically what Reddit is A steaming pile of SHIT Once voat gets its shit together Im saying adios to this trash including fantasy content eg stories anime that encourages or promotes pedophilia child exploitation or otherwise sexualizes minors Its like video games promotes violence all over again Why is rshoplifting still around despite the fact that its encouraging breaking the law This is really stupid Obviously CP is terrible and should be banned from this site but what concerns me is the rest of the sentence including fantasy content eg stories anime that encourages or promotes pedophilia child exploitation or otherwise sexualizes minors Depending on the context this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts This wording is very vague and leaves a huge gray area So are you going to ban anime because some anime kind of sexualize minors Why does it matter if theyre not real What if they look like a minor but are actually a  year old dragon How do you determine what promotes pedophilia and child exploitation What do you mean depending on context You cant enforce this and shouldnt be trying Please focus on the real fucked up shit that actually hurts people If I go get a job at Kotaku or Salon and write an article or two about how Reddit encourages murdering animals or being as autistic as humanly possible when it comes to the treatment of women will you actually consider doing something about the subreddits that may actually effect someones life outside of the site instead of purging some random communities that have existed for years and years because theyre incredibly loosely related to some new bullshit controversy that no one will remember in a week Thats not mentioning the subs that have actively been participated in and encouraged the type of rhetoric thats lead to a man killing his own father Truly nothing can be done about places like that I understand Dont like fat people though None of that Want to get your dick hard looking at someone that looks like someone else What a monster Why stop at porn I mean anything that could even slightly be considered sexual assault or inappropriate should be banned Heres a great examplehttpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsvyuhitookgradphotoswithmyboyfriendofthetime Look at the way theyre rubbing together non consensually DISGUSTING Im unsure how a broad set of rules like this benefit the site as a whole It seems that you appear to just be giving yourself more broad powers to ban any sub you disagree with It is clear that this is a change caused by some celebs lawyer getting in contact with Reddit and you guys making a kneejerk response however what are the applications for this rule with for example hentai Yes No Up to us and what this one particular mod gets upset by Yeah this is a well thought out plan I dont like censoring I never have if its not illegal then leave it Edit I also am really concerned with this comment  As we have said in past communications with you all we want to make Reddit a more welcoming environment for all users We will continue to review and update our policies as necessary The point is for users to define their own boundaries for content thats the whole point of subreddits By banning subs for not having the content you think the average ie most profitable user wants you simply reduce the quality of the content for the masses It isnt for you to show a user what you think they want to see it is to determine what they want to see and show it preferentially Is it okay to put Nick Cage into nonNick Cage movies involuntarily deleted You ban rdeepfakes for fake porn But let rwatchpeopledie share videos of people horribly dying Outstanding work Hypocrites Rip ranimemes ITT  Why are you banning rdeepfakes when sub is still up Ten minutes later sub is banned So the target is rdeepfakes or other subs like rcelebfakes What about subs like rdirtywickr There are people actively trading pictures of young girls They dont even try to hide it Young Taboo No Limits trade ulandoflobsters deleted Is this going to mean that the same Reddit mandated nonsense that goes on in rArt where the nearest hint of nudity not actual nudity and not actual photographs  but if there is even the idea that a woman is potentially naked in an image it will be deemed NSFW will spread to other subs Marking everything as NSFW kinda defeats the purpose no I refer to posts such as This onehttpswwwredditcomrArtcommentsqclbuntitledjadghorayebphotographyutmcontentcommentsutmmediumfrontutmsourceredditutmnameArt where the mods decided to tag it as NSFW because you couldnt see if the featured woman was wearing clothes or This onehttpswwwredditcomrArtcommentsqjvgpudiziaveiledtruthantoniocorradinimarble which is a marble statue of a woman covered in a veil but is not showing any nudity Quoting one of hte rArt mods We used to barely put the NSFW tag on anything except explicit pornographic art We figured its an art sub If youre subscribed here you should be ready to see some art in whatever form it is  You know what happened Our subreddit almost got banned The mod team was adamant about not wanting to be perceived as prudish by our users through the overuse of the NSFW tag and the admins were adamant we used it more often  Guess who won that argument The people who own the website We capitulated right before they either closed the subreddit or kicked out our entire mod team and replaced us I thought most people on here had the common sense not to post underage material anyway On the subject of involuntary porn does this affect the posting of photos of swimsuit or nude models type of material or clips of sex scenes from movies hentai source film maker animated material that stays legal and above board This doesnt seem well thought out and more like damage control for rdeepfakes Kind of disappointing guys Can you please ban rannouncements I find much of the content offensive to humanity and theres a huge discussion about the sexualization of minors taking place as we speak Thanks edit looks like rannouncements is still up As we have said in past communications with you all we want to make Reddit a more welcoming environment for all users WELCOME TO FACEBOOK GRANDMA rbraincels literally advocates for rape and murder of women including minors Are you going to be addressing their sexualization of minors I suggest a division of nsfw content from porn subs and from normal subsI wanna browse nsfw in subs like askreddit but not porn subs I love how this is basically all just lawyerspeak for Update on the banning of rDeepFakes and rCelebFakes because we were getting negative press Reddit prohibits the dissemination of images or video depicting any person in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct apparently created or posted without their permission including depictions that have been faked For clarification where is the line and who draws it Particularly in regards to fake depictions I mean NSFW Eline Powell in Game of ThroneshttpsgfycatcomAfraidMessyFoal The first sequence of that Gif is a pretty blatant fake outrage and  despite the fact that its in a play within a show  it also constitutes the majority of exposed by other people mocks Blanket ban then for safety Litmus test These lobstershttpsiytimgcomviHLEqWEmaxresdefaultjpg are mating theres no indication of if it was voluntary pornography or something that was supposed to be kept in the privacy of the tank Does it violate current sitewide rules Or is ulandoflobsters going to admit to being one of the lobsters we want to make Reddit a more welcoming environment for all users Yeah right Except the hundreds and hundreds of user types that you dislike But i guess everyone doesnt include those you dislike Is there a master list of all the subs that have been recently banned I know a bunch of Darknet subs got banned recently but I missed the announcements about it What about taking photos of people in public while theyre sleeping and posting them here so millions of people can point and laugh Is that still okay We need clearer guidelines on what sort of involuntary photography is acceptable and what isnt  a more welcoming environment for all users Translation try to create bubbles similar to Facebooks Remember keep the web safehttpsboygeniusreportfileswordpresscomfreethenipplecampaignfacebookinstagramjpgqualitystripallw  including fantasy content eg stories anime wait how does that work anime characters dont have real ages Way to not just address your problem This clearly is just a DIRECT response to rdeepfakes nothing more or less This site is ran clearly by pussies Really disappointed with this clearly PRdriven decision Im all for the banning of legitimate sexualization of minors All for it And I think Reddit has been doing a standup job of getting rid of that from their website But you must be seriously daft if you cant distinguish the difference between reality and fiction It has been proven time and time again that fiction rarely has damaging affects on reality It was proven in the massive video game scandal in the early s too when outraged parents picketed video games like GTA for their clear glorification of murder Yet as many many cases have proven at worst these games prove to be outlets at best they are a fun pastime Banning art is absurd And while it is reddits right to refuse any content on their website Id hope to see a little more intelligence from the staff Truly disappointing Especially when according to reddit Thishttpswwwredditcomrgurotop is okay Really Graphic glorification of sexual violence is okay But just because one thing is a bigger taboo in one culture makes it banworthy This is PRdriven hypocrisy Either NONE of it is okay or ALL of it is okay You dont get to pick and choose what art you get to censor Well you do but its just hypocritical as fuck  Overall super disappointed with the reddit staff Id hope for more intelligent thoughts on these issues as we dont live in  anymore where GTA was a controversial game  welcoming environment for all users even those who encourage politically charged reallife violence Can an Admin tell us if this celebrity consented to the current top post in rfunny httpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsvyuhitookgradphotoswithmyboyfriendofthetime deleted We try not to sexualize Annie shes young How come you guys dont ban rNomorals Is the page linked all over reddit going to get updated Specifically httpswwwredditcomhelpcontentpolicy Id honestly never even seen the pages linked in OP until this post edit just noticed it got added thanks admins AKA Deepfakes is getting popular lets define the rules to stop it deleted The good Going after the disgusting pedophiles skirting around the rules to exploit and hurt REAL human beings The bad banning SFW clothed depictions of anime girls because some fucking moron thought it was pedophilia Pictures are not real human beings and do not have rights All studies and evidence heavily imply that lolicons do not go on to become pedophiles nor is there any proof that this stuff grooms and conditions people Its sheer pseudoscience Weve had this argument with violence in video games violent films etc and it always ends the same way Fictional media does not influence real world actions unless youre already insane and cannot distinguish between reality and fiction If you want to ban NSFW loli because it poses a legal risk to a lot of people living in uncivilized counties where drawings can get you imprisoned thats fine But banning SFW anime because it has an unsexualized character that looks young is fucking insane Posting a WORKSAFE picture of two anime characters kissing or hugging should not get you banned If this is the direction this site is going then Im finished with it Start focusing on the real problems instead of scapegoat artificial issues generated to distract from the very real and growing issue of political violence being advocated and organized in this website  soliciting lookalike pornography This means asking which pornstars that look like x celebrity is against the rules Why I thought this was going to be related to my CEOP report that I made upon realisation that rratemeteen is basically a virtual peadophile ring I had an account with over  karma that I had to removedue to posting on what I thought was a safe sub for teens to rate one anotheras rrateme is for over s What I actually got was several older men messaging me asking for nudesblowjobs and other sexually ecplicit thingseven though it was crystal clear I was fifteen They told me I was sexymy legs were hot and wrote in detail the things theyd do to me Upon further inspectionI realised this sub wasnt for teens after all If you look at the top posts of all time youll see its all underage girlsmany photos looking like theyd unknowlingly been taken off facebook where older men would talk about how sexually attractive and vunerable they are This isnt helped by the fact the old moderator of the page was called something along the lines of uchildporn And in all honestyI feel exploited I have no idea what those men did with my photos I shouldve checkedbut im young and I took the safe community for teens subtitle as gospel Get rid of this sub reddit Please Before other young girls get taken advantage of just like I have been So deepfakes gets banned because you dont want heat from celebs but animal cruelty in rnomorals gets to stay up Nomorals should be banned immediately If you feel the need to change rules at will why is your moral compass saying rdeepfakes is bad but not rnomorals Also please ban powermoderators and Reddit will be great What age defines a minor as this changes by country and local law For instance the age of consent in several countries in the EU is as low as  In the US it varies state by state between  and  This is just the western world there are some outliers in Africa and the middle east and far east where the age of consent is lower still deleted Why didnt you just try turning it off then back on again Thanks for the informative update It always makes things less frustrating to have an idea of what is going on I was stuck in a loop Oh Reddit is down Ill just go on Reddit That happened more times than Id like to admit deleted Its a lot better since I joined last year I understand some of these words EDIT I understood all of these words  Thanks for the karma The fact that Zookeeper lives in the Amazon now This entertains me greatly Reddits uptime is nothing compared to where it was a couple years ago When I received a Reddit is down message yesterday I think that was the first time I had seen it in several months A couple years ago it happened several times a day Cheers on the improved stability Also thanks for the explanation Interesting to hear how a large website is managed Whoever was doing all the migration stuff or at least watching it How bad was that stomachdropintoapit feeling I accept your apology I love you ugooeyblob  was a hoax perpetrated by our government My post mortems are usually to a CEO not an announcement on one of the viewed sites on the web I dont envy you Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations Does that mean till now engineers did things like this solo Oh Reddits down lets check Reddit to see why Made me realize just how much Im reliant on this site I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for the very detailed explanation and for the transparency you have provided regarding the recent situation I dont use Reddit in a commercial capacity Its just for fun and entertainment Some downtime doesnt bother me in the least when it comes to nonbusiness critical services I wish some of my businessrelated service providers would be as detailed and transparent as you have been You folks set a great example for others deleted All that matters is everything is back up and working Thanks for continuing to modernize reddit  now what do I do with this bigass pitchfork               Without Reddit I didnt know what popular opinion I needed to affect on Facebook It was social hell As a software guy let me say that this is probably the most important thing  Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations  Some people hate pairing but for risky ops jobs you really want at least two sets of eyes on every problem If youre not pairing during development at least you can code review You cant code review ops changes to a live system You also want to loudly announce every change youre making so that if shit hits the fan other people can read through your announcements and help try to figure out what went wrong Explaining what you did while youre in a panic sucks you want the explanation to already be out there Is the autoscaler a custom inhouse solution or is it a productservice Just curious because Im nosey about Reddits inner workings  our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it Sounds like Chef or Puppet did its job First Harambe now this I think its time we got rid of these zookeepers edit i expected a lot more upvotes for this little bit disappointed in you guys tbh Reddit was down the whole european timezone deleted  Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once This is a top lesson Ive learned in my career  Rate limit all the things  Automate all the things Definitely in that order Never code an automated task without a rate limit because youre sitting on a task designed to destroy everything If it needs to be instant it should be a toggle that can be reverted If its not revertible then a special flag like clowntown that clearly signals You better be able to explain why you did this should be tied to the action and again never automated Im betting the gotcha here is a periodic run of SaltChefPuppet that said Whoops this thing isnt running Here it goes  which brings us back to defending the massive termination with the rate limiter Its really refreshing to see some transparency from the admins after downtime like this You guys dont need to post anything really but its really appreciated to know what happened why it happened and what youre doing about it I do have a question Will this migration have more servers in Reddit to prevent any more messages saying like Reddits servers are full Sometimes I wonder why Reddit doesnt have more servers  never happened So obvious question here howwhy did the autoscaler restart itself Has it reached sentience Is the autoscaler the singularity Acknowledgement of a problem in a timely manner Thorough explanation of said problem Straightforward summary of how they plan to prevent said problem Bananas This is madness I finally had to break up with my fiance because we realized how terrible we were for each other once we no longer had an easy reliable platform to spam each other with the same cat pictures weve already seen all day   Edit lol holy shit thanks for the gold Rock on guys Sounds like the sort of thing that would happen to me All kinds of automation and management software to make my job easier and then it bites me in the ass If you guys ever need another engineer let me know  RIOT Edit Checks date Dammit I missed it again Puts back pitchfork I cant believe youve done this Thanks for the public post mortem Theyre greatly appreciated in the Ops community as they make us all just a little more knowledgeable Would you mind going into a little more details about this because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it Just curious what happened there I feel like you guys get forced to publish these analysis as punishment  We use a system called Zookeeper NeverForgetHarambe For future reference ugooeyblob can you please use UTC timezone when posting case studies It would make my Day if an admin replied to me Why did you move away from Zookeeper  Is the new system way better  Are you sure nobody plugged something in wrong at Reddit HQ httpiimgurcomTGAwqvhjpg You seem like a really neat person Thanks for being you How I read this In

and talk with my father He seems like a nice guy I was forced to watch Netflix without browsing Reddit I actually understood the show Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new more modern infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldnt get confused about which servers should be available It unexpectedly turned back on at PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it That sucks I work in IT and things dont always go as planned Thanks for the thorough post mortem and the hard work So Zookeeper caused a lot of this Mustve been Harambes zookeepers trying to cover something up  It unexpectedly turned back on at PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it Dont you hate it when your systems work as intended Im chuckling because for the longest time one of our systems never caught our manual

well seems like it was working but now is broke Mods please put up a messaging explaining that it isnt working and has been taken down temporarily Gonna have a lot of WTFs otherwise Be good to each

gonna take me hours to figure out wth is going on isnt it As part of Team Periwinkle I hope they dont let those Orangered folks muck this up this blows I want to be a part of this but I dont know what

but maybe it will make someone day a bit better than how mine started i have no idea whats going on Im here for the karma Hopefully its a machine to fix this horrible mobile app A machine for the glorious Separatist Alliance To surpass Metal Gear I must know I must know Wait why does it say community unavailable Is that the joke Is the joke that its not a real thing and people just talk about like its a real thing My head hurts and in a little nauseous I might need a nap When are you going to ban thedonald Or does reddit enable far right extremism How do you comment on other peoples comments on mobile dont mind me just getting some karma so i can post my meme Thanks I hate it Can we please get rplace and rthebutton back These last two April st subs have been weak as shit Why though I dont get the appeal at all all Ive seen are random combinations of gifs Its like a shittier visual version of raskouiji without a question this makes me not want to use reddit anymore Big ahert fard Yeah can you unban rWatchpeopleDie though Do you have any plan to include a spoiler tag for comments Or an NSFW tag for comments I think both could be pretty useful Is this the spoiler tag thats been used in rmovies for a while If so then kudos It looks pretty nice Forgive me if this has been addressed before or I missed it but is there anything planned for spoilers that are actually included in the title of the post I know it may be kind of silly but there have been times where a title itself was a spoiler and I read it without knowing I use a Chrome extension called Unspoiler that blocks out certain keywords and allows me to unhide them Something similar to that might be cool Thanks for the work youve already done I am definitely a fan Edit HereshttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailunspoileroookgbbhgojdebhnmkmhgfagoiknifgihlenUS a link to Unspoiler in the Chrome Web Store if anyone is interested in seeing how it works Edit As I said to uZagorath below I also think it would be great if the spoiler tag placed on the title blocked out the spoiler and users could modify what the tag itself would say It would be helpful if it said something like SE Spoiler and users would know to avoid it uGraklingHunter brought the top all time post in rWarframe to my attention and it implements spoiler tagging titles tastefully It would just be made better with the ability of descriptions I hadnt watched the episode where they created spoiler tags yet this post needs a spoiler tag Awesome This is an awesome addition upowerlanguage THANK YOU twinervouslaughFinally dont have to wonder why there is a NSFW post in a sub for a kids show Ive made that misconception so many times I wonder if rd party apps will have spoiler functionality else I will finally have a reason to download the official one Now for the hard part getting people to actually use them Could it be possible to customize the SPOILER tag to write information about the spoiler Example If someone posts a spoiler about the  season of GOT the spoiler tag should say SPOILER S so that people who are currently watching season  can view the spoiler Otherwise they could think that it is a spoiler for season  Does this mean anything for the spoilers that the mods put on the flairs in rchan In before someone asks about when we get spoiler support in comments with a universal consistent formatting Is there any way using RES or Greasemonkey to turn that off The whole click to see spoilers really ruins usability during sport events in some subs since every single post now requires an expando click and another mouse click to view it The worst thing is the click isnt stored so every time you visit the page the spoiler alert shows up even if youve visited the post before Please I love spoilers is there any way I can get rid of the antispoiler blocker It feel like something my adblock should take care of for me Will there be a way to turn off this feature on our end so we dont have to do extra clickthroughs if we dont care about spoilers Thats great but I think spoiler tags for comments are needed much more There are already several ways to mark a post as a spoiler including the word SPOILER but theres no reliable way to do that for comments Dont suppose theres an option to disable the hidden posttext I mean if I click on a post that has the spoiler flag on its link then I know what Im getting into Please add the option to opt out of this feature or at least supress click to see spoiler  I know its a spoiler I already clicked Huh a rKingdomHearts shoutout in an announcement post whodve thunk that Its been in effect on rbreakingbad and it is one of the best changes Reddit has made since Ive been a user I love it  OP can now mark their post as a spoiler Can mods mark a post as a spoiler Or what about allowing users to vote a post as a spoiler in case the mods are all sleeping andor jerks Spoiler alert Good work by admins Now we just need the NSFL tag to differentiate between sexy NSFW and gross NSFW Now we just need yall to kindly split NSFW into NSFWNSFL like weve been asking for for years I would absolutely love to be able to completely filter out NSFL from my feed How about tags to differentiate between NSFW nudity NSFW language and NSFW graphic imageryNSFL I guess this is a good start Gendry is in the boat with Nymeria right deleted Hooray for universal functionality Coming never in an Alien Blue update Just in time for the new Zelda game Im glad this is becoming an official thing now I know of a few subreddits that rejiggered the NSFW tag to stand in place of an actual spoiler tag so its good to know that we can actually mark spoilers now while still having use of the NSFW tag Would you please bring back the old system for expanding and shrinking comments on mobile It is really annoying to try tapping a link only to open and close a comment  times I havent seen this mentioned yet the spoiler tag is basically invisible using RES night mode Just checked out the examples and the SPOILER tag is barely visible on desktop using RES night mode This isnt a big deal for text posts since there is an additional click through but for images it is extremely easy to miss Thanks for the new feature hell yeah now rsquaredcircle will be less nsfw I thought these were already implemented Already broken by RES night mode The spoiler tag is practically invisible Could you introduce some kind of WYSIWYG editor like a lot of VBulletin forums have Ive been on here a few years now and I still find the formatting markup to be extremely counterintuitive Can you make a different NSFW flair for pornographic posts I would like to be able to specifically filter just for out porn from my rall feed Ruminating on the whereabouts of Gendry in rgameofthrones I havent seen more than a handful of Game of Thrones I have no idea who Gendry is However based on what I know of the show I am very confident in saying SPOILER Gendry is dead Please let us turn this off If I click on a spoiler post I know its going to be a spoiler I can read All this does is make a few of the subs I frequent an irritating unreadable mess I dont care one iota about spoilers either way Where is the option to ignore the tag and always show everything Yes This will be super useful for rstevenuniverse Thanks Super random and maybe nitpicky but would you guys consider adding a minimize feature to the list of filtered subreddits from rall Every time I go to rall on desktop now Im immediately reminded of all a bunch of hate subsetc that I want to hide from view because theyre all listed in the sidebar I find that I only really browse all on mobile now because of this Now we need a way to distinguish between NSFW as in porn and NSFL as in beheading Amazing feature I think no one likes spoilers This is great Would there ever be a possibility of an NSFL tag as well Because Ive clicked on a few links that saw NSFW thinking that its just porn nothing much and its a picture of a dead baby or something Aww no more surprises at work I can barely see the spoiler tag since Im using a dark theme Does this have something to do with RES or reddit itself httpiimgurcomUnwrJApng What about the spoiler posts that hit rall from the random subreddits based around that specific spoiler Will those still be glaringly obvious as I read through titles and hit a spoiler It works on Relay Yay Have you thought about implementing a way to censor spoilery text on post titles Because even if the pic is pixelated if the title is something like when Character kills Othercharacter it wont serve much raceattorney has that function on their CSS I really want to like the iOS official reddit app but having NSFW content thumbnails randomly pop up while browsing rall is a dealbreaker for me especially if Im trying to be discreet showing someone something on rall There needs to be a thumbnail option in addition to Always Show Never Show and Community Default to have NSFW thumbnails interactively displayed spoilered or only displayed when its opened Hint how WP Readit does it Also comments not loading is a bummer otherwise the app would be good No support for Alien Blue I thought it was an official app deleted  Getting excited about the long awaited Japanese release of rKingdomHearts  Final Chapter Prologue Im fucking dead nail on the head right there Can I turn off this feature Id like to see spoilers just as I turn off blurring nsfw posts You missed the opportunity for this post to use the spoiler tag about the new changes Good work Any plans for an NSFL tag Im unspoilable do I have the option of turning it off sitewide Is there a specific NSFL tag I hate that redditors are abusing the NSFW tag for NSFL content You expect to see boob but instead you see goreblood  Gives Admin Gold Is Admin Can we get a permanent spoiler tag for anything posted on rThedonald Stating Most of this shit posted here is false believe at your own risk I dont mind spoilers I can and want to be able to read spoiler regardless of the subjet Can we have options like for NSFW posts and show the thumbnail for a spoiler post  Thanks Who thought it was a good idea to not have an option to disable spoilers Or who forgot about such an option Either way that person deserves a paddlin Can we get the option to turn this off Very cool Looks like RES is not yet updated to work with spoiler images but I imagine its just a matter of time deleted Can we get a better block user tool next Id like to be able to filter out all people who post to hate subreddits Thanks This is great to see I hated not having a clear distinction between NSFW and spoilers This is a huge win for regular discussionbased subs Im having some issues with this in rrunescape On that subreddit the feature was not enabled by default I enabled it and it works but as soon as a moderator posts a thread with spoiler in the title the entire feature turns off EDIT Seems to be fixed now I like the implication on it Can we get a different color for nightmode Yes finally i was tired of clicking on NSFW links and seeing harry potter spoilers instead of porn what is the culture industry  Is there a way to view a subreddit without the spoiler posts even showing up Something like httpnsredditcomrStarWars Doesnt work in Bacon Reader worked in Relay for  seconds then Relay crashes Oh well  Other users can then decide whether or not they want to view the post Do we now have the option to always see spoilers or never see spoilers like we do for NSFW It will be annoying to the people who dont give a rats ass to spoilers if they have to click one more time on each individual post Can we have more specific NSFW tags like gore  nudity Any plans to make different tags for NSFW and NSFL content How do I use one Ive been seeing and occasionally using spoiler tags on reddit for years Im so confused that this is new Is it that I was using some subreddits custom implementations and now there will be a standard Shout out to rasoiaf which has the best spoiler system and anti spoiler culture Ive ever seen online or at least did back when I used to hang out there Spoiler tags never worked once youve disabled subreddit styles so Im looking forward that those get included on a base level i think you should add a NSFW tag list option so we know if its nudity or just blood or something weird etc yeah this is going to make things so much better now adress the censorship and the stealth editing So much fanfare for something so trivial Is there any chance you all will lift the ignore subreddit limit for rall It gave me an error when I went to add probably the th sub to it almost all are Porn subs Is there a way to blur NSFW content on the android app Many a time I will be browsing rall and certain NSFW subreddits appear and sometimes in classpublic its weird So is there still no way to disable it the way several of us asked for during the test  Ruminating on the whereabouts of Gendry in rgameofthrones And spoiler for those without HBO Now Thanks admins I myself have worked out a perfect solution to avoid spoilers on a race weekend I dont come here Seriously I always dl the race so I can get the Sky feed Also because I am married and have children and responsibilities I usually am a day behind and am unable to watch until late at night Sometimes I can watch The F Show and Qualy by Saturday bedtime otherwise I watch as much of the rest I can on Sunday night Sometimes I dont complete watching the race until Monday night But usually from the beginning of P on Friday until I have finished watching the race I am never here After I am done of course I am here for days LOL Steven Wow I guess you could say this isrevolutionaryredditlutionary Is there any way to turn the spoiler tags off I really dont care about spoilers and would appreciate not having to have the extra click when viewing posts good idea in theory but it requires that everyone viewing a particular subreddit wont spoil stuff and will use the spoiler tags and there will always be that one guy that goes omg did you see when blah blah blah without the tags ruining things for anyone reading regardless imo the best way to avoid spoilers is toavoid subreddits discussing the content its a good idea in theory but everyone has to avoid posting spoilers and people enjoy trolling fanbases ie the guy yelling snape kills dumbledore at a harry potter line Is this an unironic use of culture industry Yea these are pretty much invisible in RES night mode and I never want to get blinded by white backgrounds even though I have flux Ignore this post BRING BACK ELLEN PAO PRAW  supports marking submissions as spoilers for anyone who is curious  pixilate the preview image Why is there no way to opt out of this I dont care about spoilers and I dont want to see a pixelated image Now I might miss something Id want to see because Im not going to bother with a blurred image gfycat wow I dont get it  I dont see a HOW TO anywhere here That should be at the top Ugh You set it AFTER you post really AFTER This is a long time coming Thanks guys What about SRS s Cool When are you guys going to revert back to showing approximate upvotes and downvotes for comments instead of just net upvotes Also Ive messaged the admins at rredditcom about this before and got no response so Ill ask it herewhy havent you guys disabled downvotes for the first hour or two after a submission is made Manipulating the content on any subreddit is probably trivial right now for anyone with  sock accounts and Tor One or two people could just camp out on any subredditprobably even defaultsand manipulate the whole thing just by mass downvoting any submission they dont like Nice Wait the admins play Kingdom Hearts too If so Reddit just became x better Its about god damn time it only took you guys a decade Glad its live for everyone now Hopefully you also add the comment spoilertag feature soon And for those who keep asking for an NSFL tag read the rideasfortheadmins FAQhttpswwwredditcomrideasfortheadminswikifaqwikiwhydontwehaveansfltagF and ukemitches linked commenthttpswwwredditcomrideasfortheadminscommentssrjnnsfwisredrightandbrowsingisgreysomakecbxa  Stop using NSFW as boobies Its not It means for one of a variety of reasons this link has a higher than normal chance of getting you fired from work if your boss or IT catches you with it  If you want rboobs or rboobies go there If you want rpenis go there If you want something else theres probably a subreddit for that too We dont need NSFW NSFWman NSFWwoman NSFL reallyNSFL reallyreallyNSFL tags Its too subjective and implementing it codewise isnt going to get everyone to get on the same page Discussing the rStarWars universe at length Following Worlds in rleagueoflegends Ruminating on the whereabouts of Gendry in rgameofthrones Watching the showrunner get involved in the fan theorizing on rwestworld Getting excited about the long awaited Japanese release of rKingdomHearts  Final Chapter Prologue Speculating on the upcoming season of rtwinpeaks If you put a  in front of the r it will automatically form a link to the subreddit in question without the link having to be inserted manually like so rStarWars Can we please have a feature to filter all NSFW subreddits out of rall Spoiler Thanks YES My favorite showsmovies can just be ruined by other asshole subreddits anyways though  Just in time for the playoffs I always watch my American football on a Wednesday night and a few results always get spoilt Love this thanks Can there be a thing for people writing the title of the media they are spoiling Awesome I am happy this suggestion made it to implementation Is there a Todo or suggestion list for site wide changes I cant believe you didnt use a spoiler tag for this post Neato Just to satisfy my curiousity is this similar to the ability to sticky for mods and to enabledisable inbox replies Just press the button and BAM spoiler screen Thank you How does this look in the frontpage view OP can now mark their post as a spoiler Can mods also add spoiler tags after the post has been created Is there a way to migrate the entirety of a subs NSFW posts to spoiler posts This would be useful for subs that used NSFW for an unintended purpose Woo Finally They realize the pants werent magical at the end and the middle sister dies Today was a good day rresidentevil needs this right now Thank you a ton  looks to be a good year now This will be very useful Thank you Tammy memes on rrickandmorty Sincerely a mod Well if theres one thing I knew you guys would be experts at its spoiling things Orange s Will this be retroactive Will this work on alien blue Ive always planned on holding on to this app until its pried from my cold dead hands but I dont want to see spoilers everywhere on my front page Sounds cool I dont really know where to ask this question but Im wondering  how does it work that a persons post has for example k upvotes but on his profile it says hes only got k karma overall no we wanted spoilers for comments not threads get it right Awesome feature Thank you I always like new features like this one but as you continue to improve the site how will you balance feature bloat on a website with this many users Now only if you could teach people that a lot of things are considered spoilers that they dont think are spoilers didnt work LOL luv u guys Hmm I thought this would be like a unified spoiler tag for posts so every subreddit doesnt need a different spoiler code Is this just the nsfw tag but different text I definitely clicked the picture to see what was behind the spoiler filter So Im seeing NSFW images in the thumbnail now Itd be nice if those remained hiden deleted That Rock and Morty post on rgaming still pisses me off I cannot wait for this in OPM He was dead was normal and was his father Any plans for spoiler tags that actually blur the title of the post That seems more useful More often than not the title IS the spoiler This is excellent Now I no longer have to try to figure out whether something is actually NSFW or if it is a spoiler post Is there a way to reset the spoiler tag Ive read the spoiler then I click on the link for a friend but dont want them to read the spoiler So I push spoiler tag below and it resets Oh cool Im still on alien blue Will this work for me Only text posts are hidden for me image posts are just shown Im guessing thats a bug given that image posts are shown to be hidden too in the OP Can we get a tag to know when a post is a gif o a gifv Is there a way to disable this ii Foreign Requests NonEmergency In  Reddit received  requests for the production of user account information from foreign governmental authorities excluding emergency requests Reddit did not comply with any of these requests I noticed that the specific foreign governments are unlisted in either the posted summation above or the actual Report Is there a legal reason why the governments were unlisted Wouldnt transparency be better served by saying X from Canada Y from the UK Z from Russia and  from Vatican City or something like that Hi Spez Copyright seems to be a big issue for many large websites especially YouTube and I see daily posts about YouTube acting unfairly It looks as though Reddits DMCA requests are increasing exponentially It looks at though each request at the moment is viewed manually Im concerned that as the rate of requests increases this process may be automated and the human aspect of the reviewing process eg Fair use may be lost Whats in the pipeline for Reddit for this requests According to the transparency report  posts were blocked in Turkey in response to a request from the Turkish government more than any other country Were these posts blocked in Turkey for being critical of the Erdogan regime Just out of interest From the perspective of a large company how difficult haswas adapting to the EUs GDPR regulation been Years ago I got into the habit of messaging reddit admins whenever I found people selling reddit upvotes or accounts The handful of times this happened I got a quick reply and you guys seemed to appreciate and intervene Sometime in the last few years I stopped getting replies Also I started seeing a ton more upvotes being sold and a very obvious manipulation of the front page  just google how I bought my way to reddits front page there are literally dozens of articles and videos of people repeating the same experiment That being said what steps are you actively taking right now to make sure reddit is a manipulationfree zone Im not talking troll farms pushing a political agenda Im talking about your average Joe buying  upvotes for a few bucks Hi Steve Im one of the authors on the recent CSCW paperhttpswwwccgatechedueshwaruploadseshwarnormscscwpdf studying moderation and community norms on Reddit Im glad that our paper was useful to explain Reddits multilayered architecture for moderating content and the norms that develop Look forward to going through the transparency report in detail What are you planning to do with the money youve recently raised Besides keeping Reddit running I assume are there any specific goals in using it Hi Steve What do you have to say to the members of the Reddit community who have expressed concerns about Reddit taking on Tencent as an investor You said you received  request to remove content from a governmental entity in the United States Can you be a bit more specific as to what topic this request was concerned with I try to understand what content might warrant this outlier Why do I have to optout of the redesign over and over again And which moron came up with it anyway Question a bit offtopic What is Reddits stance on subreddits using bots to autoban users for participating in certain other subs Will any actions be taken against that or is it allowed  In  Reddit received a total of  request to remove content from a governmental entity in the United States The request was for the removal of an image and a large volume of comments made underneath it for potential breach of a federal law As the governmental entity did not provide sufficient context regarding how the image violated the law did not provide Reddit with valid legal process compelling removal and the request to remove the entire post as well as the comment thread appeared to be overbroad Reddit did not comply with the request I really want to know which post this was Thanks for the update Spez Why do you think there is such a large increase in requests from last year Will you ever modify or remove content to appease your new Chinese overlords investors Can you commit to never doing so Who are you selling my data to and how can I know who you are selling my data to on an ongoing basis When are you going to address the astroturfing Its just like porn  you know it when you see it But every time someone suggests a post is an ad because say its a new bride eating a beautiful Big Mac in her wedding dress posted by a  day old account that is only responding in emojis a mod will claim that the conspiracy theorist has no evidence Its getting worse every day and the recent Gallowboob  Netflix post was an extremely visible episode e New LogohttpswwwredditcomrHailCorporatecommentsamgkrnetflixpaysugallowboobtoadvertiseonredditstJSPSAEWshdef e Heres a fresh example  month old account with  lifetime comment posting a feel good story that happens to mention CVS httpswwwredditcomrMadeMeSmilecommentsaqwgthisguyknowshowtocounthisblessingsstJSSQNHshbfd But nothing suspicious about that of course How can governments request specific user info Do they somehow get access to an individuals username and proceed from there Why havent you banned uGallowBoob Why are there subreddits that will automatically ban you if they detect you commenting in an entirely different sub about an entirely different topic no matter what the comment was Why are power tripping mods not being punished as much as they realistically should be What if anything are you guys going to do about the obvious bought and paid for posts and upvotes on many default subreddits that are advertising products blatantly as opposed to going through the normal channels of advertising on this site uspez whats the status on title editing that I asked you about last year Reddit youve lost credibility when it comes to transparency How about you take action against power abusing moderators of subreddits Reddit moderators has been accused of partisanship and censorship by many users for months now I get it that subreddits are owned by moderators and they are moderated by their rules But that policy doesnt suit for country subreddits when you set country based subreddit as homepage of Reddit based on IP addresshence geolocation of user Im talking about rindia here There is extremely wrong going on at rindia  Moderators have been banning people left and right without any explanation When the reason is asked then those people get muted for  hours  Moderators have been deleting posts and comments which dont align with their political narrative The posts and comments get deleted who disagree with them  Meta posts are not allowed One cant write anything about rindia or its moderators in rindia  Users are shadowbanned  Mods and their favorite users break rules all the time and they do not get banned Their posts dont get deleted  Mods do indulge in witchhunting Many users were banned just because they participated in other subs other than rindia Isnt it withhuntingstalking  Many users have been banned for a very generic and polite comment While other users openly break subreddit rules and Reddit sitewise rules and they were never banned Many users openly call for violence on daily basis They never get banned Those users have posted violent comments called for genocide and massacre and made very vile racist and bigoted comments and they enjoy free pass there Note In one the cases one moderator messaged a user and told himher kys I hope you know what it means  Unfortunately those moderators have been appointed in rworldnews too And the same tactics are applied there Many Indians got banned for very generic comments Im sure many Indians contacted admins about it a lot of times but never reciprocated That makes me think if you guys are not serious about it or admins themselves are part of the ecosystem to silence one side to propagate the political narrative and agenda by using tools of censorship Note  Reddit removed the data of traffic of rindia from the public after the revelation that more than  traffic comes from outside India Why you needed to remove the data That arises the question on your companys credibility on transparency hi Steve can you tell me more about this subreddit httpswwwredditcomrNIGGERHATE thanks  United States Governmental Removal Requests NonCopyright In  Reddit received a total of  request to remove content from a governmental entity in the United States The request was for the removal of an image and a large volume of comments made underneath it for potential breach of a federal law As the governmental entity did not provide sufficient context regarding how the image violated the law did not provide Reddit with valid legal process compelling removal and the request to remove the entire post as well as the comment thread appeared to be overbroad Reddit did not comply with the request Which post Ban uGallowBoob he is profiting from actively censoring over  subreddits he currently moderates and is a megalomaniac who thinks he is some sort of god Cool Why is uGallowBoob allowed to accept money for posts The current methods of reporting users to the admins is understandably quite lacking If I find a bot account thats clearly reposting all I can do is leave a comment informing others and then not much else Ive seen it stated elsewhere in this thread though that theres an email to contact and so Ill be looking into that but it should be made clear on the site for those looking for it And beyond bot accounts human accounts of people severely abusing the system Namely uGallowBoob but there are many others like him Moderating over  subs and blatantly removing comments critical of him and using moderation powers to steal OC and ban the victims and breaking not only subredditspecific rules spam namely but sitewide ones as well I find it quite disturbing that someone with the amount of power he has has been allowed so long to thrive and make money from his abuse deleted The current options for reporting issues to the admins leaves much to be desired especially when its time sensitive Using the httpswwwredditcomreporthttpswwwredditcomreport form is nice but results in automated messages devoid of context making it difficult to keep track of which issues have been handled by admins Modmailing rredditcom is vastly superior in this regard but the lack of a structured reporting system makes it less streamlined and yall are clearly pushing us away from it The response rate for both is slow at best The lack of any rapid response support from the admins was quite obvious this past week during the latest witchhunt against Gallowboob Not everyone has access to admincomms and even then its no longer a reliable method of contacting the admins What are yall doing to improve the reporting and prompt handling of issues And dont you dare fucking say machine learning So about GallowBoob or whatever anything you are gonna do to him for abusing of his mods power  why havent you banned ugallowboob  hes exploiting his powers every day and thats clearly against the rules Can you clarify what qualifies as sexual or suggestive content involving minors after the uholofanlife ban and unban He posted your response to the unban but it was unclear if the image was determined to not violate that policy or if he was let off as a first offense You did a good job defining minor but I still do not know if girls standing in swimsuits is sexual or suggestive I play a lot of Japanese games where they occasionally release seasonal alts of underage characters in swimsuits or even towels in normal poses Could I be in danger of violating this policy by posting official artwork of characters from rated T games Edit to clarify I am only talking about drawings that do not expose or outline anything inappropriate not real pictures of children You can look at uholofanlife as an example uspez  Im not as smart as anyone else here but Id love to know whats your opinion on users such as GallowBoob WhatTheFuckKanye dickfromaccounting etc Everyone says theyre karma whores who repost content and get paid from it such as Instagram meme accounts And is this how you envisioned  years ago Are you planning any transparency around bot and troll infestation Some reddits are riddled with bad actors and are becoming unusable EDIT I am very disappointed my question was not addressed deleted when can we download all our user data saved comments posts and mails into a zip file Hey free rwaterniggas Its about damn time we start holding these horrible over zealous sub mods accountable There needs to be a way to remove admins from a sub What are you going to do about ugallowboob and other powerhungry mods This might be a little bit controversial but why does some mod called gallowboob or something get away with breaking so many rules of Reddit Ive only started to use Reddit actively from last year or so so Im uninformed on his role here but it seems almost everybody hates the guy Its always interesting watching these Admin qa sessions pop up on reddit because the first say  answered questions are usually highly upvoted softballs then the following  questions are actually good and usually go unanswered probably because they hit a little too close to home and then the bottom is just littered with nonsensical shouting But the best part of the whole thing is because the QA or Announcements are usually on top of the front page  All of the people who have been tranquilized by and live within their personally cultivated frontpage are so innocent and out of the loop when they start reading through the questions there is almost this noticeable realization the site that theyre on is actually full of hate speech trash mods and an overall rhailcorporate mentality If it wasnt so sad it would be beautiful Keep doing these QA sessions along with your announcements and reports uspez I think it really helps shine some light on the parts of Reddit people have for whatever reason chosen to ignore Im fairly new to Reddit and I am VERY impressed with this report and the discussion concerning it Ive been on the internet since before there was a WWW and Ive never seen anything like it Actually telling users whos bugging you for our info and your responses to said bugging How radical Ive been around long enough to know that I shouldnt post anything anywhere that I wouldnt write on the back of a post card but Im still fascinated by actually seeing the volume and the process Many thanks to the Reddit staff for all their hard work Hi spez the subreddit rindia for much time now has been censored by the mods They have absolute control over not just this but other subs such as rworldnews  Any dissent is squashed and pro India comments and posts or anything going against the views of the mods or anything reflecting a pro right bias are immediately removed This reflects badly considering how it is supposed to be the national subreddit for India and its citizens Also please refer to rindiadiscussion for more examples on the mods dictatorial activities Edit Please also refer to httpsmediumcomkrantikaarirhowindiasbiggestsubredditisbeingsilentlycensoredace Edit Also there have been documented cases of people calling out for the deaths of certain right wing please dont be biased when I mention the right Your political affiliations shouldnt matter much in a discussion about freedom of speech also in India the Right and centerright is much more socialist than the american left party politicians and supporters I am not sure if they are deleted by the mods or not but it just goes on to show the toxic and fiercely anti hindu and anti nationalist environment that they have curated in the sub Examples available on rindiadiscussion Edit We support free speech but its really at the behest of the mods and we really cant do anything to enforce it How do i get the mobile site to stop asking me to download the mobile app with a popup every time i open the site or open a new post It gets annoying to close I dont want the app Ive considered coding a plugin that specifically blocks your site from asking if i want the app Please remember that ive already told you a few thousand times i dont want the app and that ive closed every dialog asking me to download or try the app Please stop Hi spez Would it be possible to move the feature for reporting violent comments directly into the report button the same way that you report comments for breaking subredditspecific rules I find comments threatening direct violence disturbingly often and unless Im missing something I find I have to go through several difficulttofind links in order to track down the form to report it Not only is this a hassle but the amount of time and dedication it takes to hunt down the form is kind of concerning given the nature of the threats that I sometimes have to report and every time I run into this issue I cant help wondering how many other users have had the same experience and either were unable to find the form to report the threat or were discouraged by how onerous it is It would be great if something could be done about this What happened to rwaterniggas rwaterniggas bro Bring back rwaterniggas From a subreddit moderator  Accusing other users of being shills is against not only our rules but reddits terms of service So is this saying that Reddit has builtin protections for paid users operated with the intent to steer discussion based on an agenda Hi spez someone just posted the following and I reported it Id like to know why your staff considered it not actionable Youre on my list now kike  you ugly deformed freaks need to get owned a th time Your people are like cancer and will be extracted from LA to NY to Tel Aviv the jewish race will cease Whats up with that shady Chinese investor money Why did you ban rwaterniggas Spez you allow incest subreddits but not a bit of water drinking I bet your piss is yellow Interesting No one gives you  million and expects nothing in return  How do you feel about becoming a major influencer in helping sow division and hate in America today Hi spez unban rwaterniggas and ban actual bad subs can you unquarantine rwaterniggas rwaterniggas Why tf did you ban rwaterniggas Hoo boy this is gonna be a shitshow Im just wondering why youve closed down subreddits that help people watch sport if theyre living overseas but those that promote violence against women are still standing Circlejerk is going to have a field day Itll be interesting to see if the quality of text posts plunges as a result  Due to various shenanigans and low effort content we stopped giving Karma for textposts over  years ago And now reddit is completely void of both shenanigans and low effort content s Im a bit concerned by this honestly The number of subreddits I know of that specifically moved away from allowing link posts and switched to text in order to prevent karma seeking  and now those subreddits have no recourse to prevent karma seeking I have a solution though  subreddit opt out Karma only applies to the subreddit itself for page display purposes and does not contribute to individual user scores edit Gold  Thank you kind anonymous stranger  This feature works really well lets fuck it up Women of reddit what is the best way to make sure that raskreddit is  the same fucking questions on repeat instead of only  July   the day shit posting won  Textposts make up over  of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept textposts Because of this Reddit has become known for thoughtprovoking witty and indepth textposts and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys Because people dont use them to get karma I dunno I kinda appreciated text posts for the fact that the posters werent clawing for karma and just wanted to share something Honestly the more I think about this the more I think its a horrible idea unless you guys give mods a way to control it Like how about the following subs  rrelationships  rshowerthoughts  rLifeProTips  rAskReddit  rexplainlikeimfive  rtifu You are encouraging people to spam and post loweffort content to these subs in an effort to just get a lot of karma Theres a huge builtin audience for subs like that and people are going to abuse the hell out of it I get that you guys want to encourage good content and reward it but Im not sure that this is the best way to go about it  Textposts make up over  of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept textposts Because of this Reddit has become known for thoughtprovoking witty and indepth textposts and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys The entire point of having text only posts in a sub is to prevent the hordes of karma farming posts and to keep post quality high This is going to mess us up so bad  Shitposting is going to be so much worse now RIP textbased subreddits Have you consider giving mods the option to decide what kinds of posts if any give Karma in their subreddits EDIT Also how come we only find out about this when the change is already done This is a huge change it could potentially ruin many big subreddits and you dont give their mods any time to prepare for it I think that has been a mistake As a moderator for rAskReddit and rIAmA but this doesnt affect there as much PLEASE make this optional I remember when textposts gained karma and it was a total nightmare for us We will see a mass influx of loweffort  catchy posts that are designed to get upvotes Its going to be lots of shitposting Text posts improved BECAUSE they didnt count for karma People making texts posts did it for the content and not internet points The main reason for the removal was the new influx of Upvote if posts The entire front page would be full of them Those arent as possible anymore with the absence of rredditcom but it shows how giving text posts link karma can devolve the content into crap Were already talking about how to harden automod to help us out but well likely need more mods Well also have to deal with an influx of modmail from people who will get upset at us for removing their post that was going to get so much karma At the scale were at we WILL feel the heat for this and as someone who remembers how things were back when reddit was even less mainstream than today I dont see how a bigger audience is going to make this less of the karmagrabbing shitshow than it was before Im really having a hard time seeing the benefit of enabling this The points dont really mean anything and this just incentivizes the people who DO care about meaningless points to try to gain karma It doesnt really reward good content and the shit content it garners is why the points were removed in the first place Edit Its already started  httpsiimgurcomZnKaaVvpng These are just the ones mentioning it Its not even counting the ones taking advantage of it Edit  Also to add this is quite a huge change to dump on moderators without any heads up whatsoever Its not cool to make us scramble to react to something that has an instant change on the types of users  content we receive and directly impacts our moderation strategy Im sorry but this was a solution seeking out a nonexistent problem Theres a lot of subreddits that are designed around the idea of text posts not giving karma to prevent a lot of loweffort mess from clogging up the works This was an unneeded change There will be ZERO benefit to this as the only thing that will change is rewarding people for bad posts which will now unfortunately climb in number This either needs to be reverted or more power put into the hands of the mods by offering them a way to disable karma gains on various types of posts in a sub This really doesnt feel very well thought out Saying it now the overall quality of text posts is going to go down the usage has matured and theyre now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content Are you SURE that hasnt happened because theres no karma involved and the writers are only writing for its own sake Im not  Due to various shenanigans and low effort content we stopped giving Karma for textposts over  years ago  However over time the usage of textposts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit And the ONLY reason they matured and became original is because they no longer generated karma meaning only people who really cared about what they were writing as opposed to whoring karma actually used them Honestly this is a terrible terrible terrible idea Did I mention terrible Be prepared for the flood of obvious shitposts and if you think there were shenanigans  years ago just think about how the current crop of shenaniganisers can ruin this for everyone By my calculations well be giving away an  million karma daily increasing the K karma supply by over  With the effect of fractional repost karmawhoring this will easily double the K karma supply and lead to rampant karma inflation As a result the mods of rCenturyClub should seriously consider pinning the entry threshold to a less volatile currency such as the ZWL or GBP This is really fucking stupid without the addition of an option to disable Karma for text posts in a subreddit Yes theyre just silly internet points but that has never stopped shitposting and karma whoring And thats fine and dandy for a very small set of subreddits that thrive on shitposts raskreddit but I think most subreddits are going to suffer because of this I thought reddit was supposed to be helping moderators by giving us new tools and making our lives a little easier This is pretty much the exact opposite of that This would all probably be no big deal at all with the inclusion of an option to toggle the feature off for a given subreddit But as it stands this is just asking for shitposts and karmawhoring  Due to various shenanigans and low effort content we stopped giving Karma for textposts over  years ago Why do you think this will be different now Part of the reason text posts have generally become higher quality is because you dont have low quality posts trying to get karma Why add karma to them They worked as is This is a silly change You mean all the quality content that was done for the love of it now gets to be CopyPasted a week later for  upvotes rAskReddit is gonna be a karmawhores paradise now that you can get link karma On ranime at the moment we require a lot of the karma whored content to be posted as self posts so that theyre not farmed This allows users to still post those forms of content if they think theyre worthy of posting but stops the subreddit from being flooded by them for karma  and makes it so that we dont need to outright ban those forms of content to keep that from happening This change would ruin that entire line of moderation At the very least maybe making it optinoptout for subs would work That way self post only subs would still be able to generate karma for their users while subs that use self posts not giving karma for moderation purposes would still be able to function without having to ban all those types of content outright Please dont Do this Nothing good will come out of this It works so why change it Youre undoing a successful measure to stop a program Wanna guess what happens next Even with something as insignificant as text posts history is gonna repeat its self Plus on another note barring all of that it kinda ruins texts posts to an extent now knowing that people are just gonna post popular things for katana Todr No Bad Admins Over the years since we disabled karma for text posts we noticed something amazing happening  content was inexplicably getting less shitty So naturally we decided to bring the karma back Yet again Im amazed by the dazzling brilliance of the reddit team Stay clever you guys Not sweet now its more difficult to sort the wheat people that engage in communication from the chaff gallowboob people that dump  picturesday on the site But hey guess itll make things easier on those forresale accounts they can just clump up in loweffort circlejerk subs and run up their scores easier When people speculate about what reddits digg moment will be this was always one of the leading contenders in my opinion Also not even a headsup to mods of selfpost only subreddits This isnt just minor Automod adjustments I suspect reposting of toprated old posts is going to skyrocket eg rjokes I just want to mention how much this absolutely FUCKS moderators of small quality subs that have textonly rules specifically to avoid karma whoring garbage You have just changed the rules that have allowed some of the best quality subs You know not the shitty defaults to exist Personally I think my redditing experience is going to be a hell of a lot worse and all I do is comment and selfpost What is the end game here What do you hope to accomplish All I see is a way to fuck over subreddits while degrading the quality of submissionsto gain what I see no benefit Can some subreddits still turn karma for selfposts off It really helps drown out some of the more loweffort karmawhoring Benefits Less low effort memes the karma whores wont need to bother anymore Good thought provoking content will be rewarded in places like rAskreddit or rELI Less linking awful websites for information that could have just been copypasted as a self post Negatives Low effort click bait questions will probably take over in places like rAskReddit Shitposting in subs such as rCirclejerk rTheDonald ect will generate the most success Reddits top users will be shitposters Off season periods in TV show subreddits will be hell on earth More so than usual Lying Theres going to be so much bullshit on subs like rTIFU It already happens enough I cant imagine it with the bonus of Internet pointzzzz Although this could make users less naive and more attentive in seeking out lies Other thoughts This post has a lot of up votes how convenient rconspiracy will be on this deleted                                                                                                                                Have you thought of allowing karma on a Sub by sub basis Like mods could enable it So raskreddit could not allow karma on self posts but raskhistorians could Or something like that  Textposts make up over  of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept textposts Because of this Reddit has become known for thoughtprovoking witty and indepth textposts and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys And now theyll become karmagrabs just like link posts thanks to this so farsighted decision I have a few questions regarding previouslymade self posts  Will karma be granted retroactively If not the following questions apply  What about new upvotes on an old post  What about new downvotes on an old post Could you end up having a net loss of karma from a post that got tons of upvotes simply because someone downvoted it after everyone stopped upvoting  What if someone who had upvoted your post before it gave karma removes their upvote now Would it take away karma not having checked to make sure any was given If so this sounds like an oversight  If it does check to make sure karma was given previously before removing it then what if someone reupvotes your post immediately after unupvoting it Would karma be given then I know several subreddits have gone the route of text posts only simply to avoid the draw of getting linkpost karma for submissions Though the karma is just internet points it drives certain users to make loweffort shitposts which increases the workload of mod teams trying to maintain a decent community so going textonly has been useful for certain communities What was the discussion like internally for how this change would alter the balance of text and link submissions and how it might change the tone of text submissions in those communities that rely on them Oi uFuckBlueShells  Demand your K for sorting out the grilled cheese fiddlers I honestly wonder sometimes if the admins even use reddit Their decisions seem so out of touch with reality it is hard to comprehend I think this will backfire This is gonna hurt subs that rely on relative quality texts posts like rshowerthoughts and rwritingprompts I hope Im wrong though Hooray for even more ways to shitpost for karma At last My time has come Does this mean that old or archived text posts will have their karma value rolled into our karma I ask because my subreddit has a combined karma requirement in order to post and Im wondering if I should reevaluate the limit ITT Reddit admins are out of touch with channel mods make site worse for everyone edit httpsiimgurcommuJiBpng So About that keeping moderators in the loop on upcoming changes I have to bring up every single time Sure would have been nice to be able to give input instead of having this just sprung on us Please bring back the visible up votes and downvotes for each comment It was much nicer to see a controversial comment with lots of ups and downs instead of a  How about going the other way around and getting rid of cumulative karma altogether No idea why anyone would care about how much karma theyve accumulated for any legitimate reason and getting rid of it altogether would undeniably lower the amount of low effort karma grabbing nonsense and reposts Youve got this all backwards In a lot of subreddits I mod we require images to be put in self posts because they are quick karma grabs Is there any way that something can be done to compromise on this issue that I know a ton of subreddits will be dealing with What about self post only subreddits that are set that way to avoid going the way of something like rfunny Ive found that these subreddits are much more enjoyable because everyone isnt trying to get a bunch of karma For those interested in some Reddit history Textposts were originally made as hack by Reddit users before being ratified by the Reddit admins as an official post type udeimorz wrote an excellent history of textposts herehttpswwwredditcomrhelpcommentsbmylwhatdoestheselfinforexampleselfhelprefercjqk upowerlanguages karma grab of the century  Enable karma for self posts  Gain absurd amounts of karma on original announcement post  Community outcry  Make another apology post still accruing mad stacks of karma  Eventually disable the feature  Laugh all the way to the karma bank RIP raskreddit How much sex and buttholes are normal for boobs Whats the worst time you sexed when you should have blowjobd Is it normal to have a penis lol penis For the good of reddit I cant stress how important it is that this be optional and determined on a subreddit basis Subreddits which foster OC in textposts eg the Star Wars or Game of Thrones subreddits in which great fan theories are posted may be allowed to award karma because text posts that are upvoted are hopefully high effort and contribute directly to the community Subreddits such as AskReddit and IAma where the comments make the post should not award post karma because the submitter  while important  only provides a conduit for great content in the comment section which is then rewarded with comment karma two questions  Why wouldnt this be retroactive It seems like itd be easier to just make it so  Will there be an option for subreddits to choose whether or no self posts give karma Itd be better for some subreddits to be able to do so  or maybe let mods mark text posts as highlow effort or something with a default setting for their subreddit Id love to see karma listed seperately  Txt link comment Ah well Good in theory as it gives those like over rice meltdown and broken arms sweet juicy karma for their greatness Terrible in practice because a shittonne of textpost shitposting is rocketing RIP in pieces moderators Why not retroactively allow past text posts to add to users karma It seems that there are  years of people posting quality selfposts Why not reward them by making a simple code change to add up all past post karma and apply it today Its essentially retroactively giving them credit for something youre saying they shouldve deserved I cant believe its been  years I was here when text posts gave karma and Im still here I dont get why people actually care about their karma but I think a good compromise would be users being able to waive karma for any post and this being shown with a symbol next to the post Mods could then still enforce no karma for images for example with Automod Maybe a kudos system would be good where users can upvote a post but choose whether or not to contribute to karma though this may just be complicating things So this wont be a retroactive change correct Mainly just curious since I personally havent had a massively popular self post I dont think this is a good idea Some subs are filled with textpost spam and a lot more text posts are low effort compared to link posts Does this mean uLumpawarroo will retroactively get his  karma points for his masterful post that blew our minds subsequently causing us to question ourselves search our feelings and then find acceptance If not theres no justice Does that only apply to new text posts or will existing comment karma be moved into post karma Let the COPY PASTA WARS begin Sweet Even more ways my lurking self wont get karma What why would you do this There are whole subreddits built around textonly posting to keep karmawhoring out of the picture Im one of the mods over at rworldbuilding We have tons and tons of really excellent content thats just walls of texts or interesting writing prompts But from time to time well also get just swamped with maps because theyre a pretty easy source of karma Im excited to see some of our writers get a bit more credit then they used to for their text no disrespect to our many fantastic artists though this is scary self posts are the only safe way to interact with toxic comunitys can you add a method of having a post imune to affecting the cost of some karma and a need for pre aproval some comuntys particuly any programing comunity give   karma per post from replys alone compared to  karma i have from the comunitys i regurly interact with if you add self karma and merge it with link karma one wrong post could wipe out a months worth of karmatwords a positive user i love the change it just needs less riskyness Fuck karma who gives a shit Can I make a suggestion Can you exempt rannouncments from your  minute front page switching up algorithm I feel like announcements post should be stickied to the top of rall and redditcom for hrs if youre subscribed to the sub I only found this post when I went into incognito to switch to my porn acc This is not the st time this has happened I think this is a misstep I think the major reason that text posts have been so thought provoking is because the lack of karma points removes any perverse incentives associated with making text posts just for the sake of points Adding karma back to text posts wont get rid of the thoughtful posts it will just bury them under an avalanche of tripe The same logic for removing points from text posts  years ago still applies now  Would textpost karma count as link karma comment karma or a third type  Please give subreddit mods the optout ability Everybody wants that  How far back will posts be retroactively given karma Isnt this kind of counter productive subreddit opt out PLEASE make it optional i loved text post no karma ill miss it i hate the karma system What a terrible fucking idea The entire reason people make good self posts are because they wanted to just talk andor karma whore in the comments Now people will just post random bullshit to try and get worthless numbers What a terrible idea And given the admins terrible mod relations you wont implement an opt inout system for your shitty idea So much for worthwhile self posts deleted welp thats it everything we know is wrong rCenturyClub just imploded Karmawhores and reposters rejoice Time to go to rcirclejerk Shit posting mode engaged The entire point of selfposts is that they show that the information posted is for a reason and not just for karma Why make this change to a system that works pretty damn well right now This will drastically alter the content in selfposts and ONLY in a negative way Fuck this When did yall motherfuckers start capitalizing reddit Its just reddit What the fuck happened yall are just doing this so that you can get that sweet karma from these Admin posts Dont lie uGallowboob is dying from excitement DAE hate change Like a lot of people I strongly disagree with this This is going to highly burden the moderators of any sport or esport sub with karma grabs for post gamematch threads becasue a lot of people will now post the thread in the hope of gaining useless karma As it stands now before the change in rsmashbros and rCFB for example there are already multiple people trying to submit selfpost no karma post game threads now it will be significantly worse As someone who has put a lot of effort and time into several selfposts it would be nice to be recognized however the no karma for selfposts system has allowed selfposts to flourish as a mechanism for actual discussion and great ideas instead of being a quick grab attempt for fake internet points Can you do something about sponsored posts botupvoted posts and posts made by bots to advertise Why has sub traffic gone private for nonmods I used to be able to go to rsubabouttraffic but now I get a dead page my only question is with this profile thing are you pushing for all that continuous internet identity crap that facebook and twitter and everyone else are doing because i would hate that i use this username for porn a lot of porn a hell of a lot of porn and venting i dont want to live on a reddit where my porn enjoyment affects my employability in the nonporn sector spez dont do that social media shit please keep this is a news and niche subject site Geospecific versions of Reddit seem weird and almost scary to me fencing off different parts of the world seems like it may create echoboxes similar to what some more vocal subreddits do already edit Added a word to create more clarity Please stop forcing my iPad Safari to the mobile site This just changed recently and I despise it IPad isnt a mobile device with its  inch screen I have to redirect to the normal site constantly Its maddening Im never using an app I just want the actual Internet as we had forever until a few months back Thanks Hola uspez I find it very hard to believe that Reddit will remove profiles among other features but namely profiles once theyve been implementedeven if they receive negative feedback The feedback collected thus far has been overwhelmingly negative and yet Reddit seems to have doubled down on the idea To be blut what gives The response to this seems to be Dont worry youll like it once its done and thats a bit concerning if it represents the companys decision making process You might as well say Were going to make major changes wether you want them or not but your feedback can help us make these changes as painless as possible This is not how to constructively use feedback What is driving these more controversial changes in the first place Clearly they were not asked for and have in fact been heavily criticized Is Reddit the company the only one actually invested or interested in these ideas at all Because a very small minority of users seem to be supporting this I would assume at least to be honest I actually have yet to see anyone happy about the idea of profiles Is that what we can expect from Reddit in the future Company always trumps unanimous user base I dont mean to be too outlandish but that seems to describe the current profile situation fairly literally Further why are you jumping straight to Youll like this feature Why not start with Do you want this feature Or even better Are there features you want Because people like Reddit For the most part they dont want it to change It seems counterintuitive to assume they want change and what changes they want nbsp I hope this doesnt come off as too critical Im being as genuine as I can and would very much appreciate a response if possible Dont get me wrong I like Reddit And for that reason I think I speak for many users when I say that there is no need to fuck with a winning formula New is not always better The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads holy shit please dont try to serve me relevant content based on information youve gathered If I want to see a subreddit Ill subscribe to it Please dont turn reddit into a pushy site that shows you what you think youll like rather that what youre subscribed to I hate Twitter for showing me what I missed and tweets that people faved not retweeted or popular tweets from people I dont follow Its annoying as hell Great Can you make it remember that Ive declined reddit mobile about a hundred times now and make it not ask me again Every time youre asked about this you just show that its possible to view the desktop version but dont address the fact that you cant stop it from asking you again This is so frustrating Address it Will the mobile web site be receiving a redesign as well What do the Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams do I heard about the redesign its said to look like facebooks News feed or Twitters timeline Is this true Because if you want to destroy Reddit then this is how you destroy reddit It works brilliantly well theres no need to change it at all How do you enforce something proactively rather than reactively Is this catching abuse before it is reported Im desperately hoping for a Minority Report system of mods in a paddling pool Did you guys feel like talking to senators changed any of their minds Edit Ive decided to never post on announcements again Reddit stop the name calling stop the dick measuring and have discussions on why you think your side of the argument is right So sick of blah blah racist conservative blah blah stupid libtard Well heres something your all assholes Edit youre all assholes Hi spez Youre talking about community hitting their stride but I think you lost your Director of Community within the last couple months From what I can tell he was a wellaccomplished guy so I found that strange Most importantly from our perspective he was very transparent especially with the mod teams Can you comment on whether or not youll be continuing the outreach and transparency that we enjoyed under AchievementUnlockds community leadership Does this mean youre going to begin phasing in a more curated front page a la FB Because plz no And if Im reading it wrong my apologies An early version of the new design which we saw during our interview looks similar to Facebooks News Feed or Twitters Timeline A neverending feed of content broken up into cards with more visuals to lure people into the conversations hidden underneath FB and Twitters timelines can you even call them timelines if they arent organized bytime have been heavily criticized and rightfully so Why redesign the front when the vast majority of users are completely happy with it Just skimming this heres what I got  reddit irl meetups around the country  closed another round of funding  referred to reddit as the product  phasing out Do Not Track  ourtrust  safety and antievil teams Sounds like something straight from Mark Zuckerberg This feels a little bit like Reddit is about to jump the shark Can you explain why there is a need to phase out Do Not Track Unless it somehow causes undue hardship on running the site I cant see how this is not just a means to grab info You could easily support both DNT and the new privacy controls Whether or not others use it shouldnt impact your choice to support it unless there is clear impact on site operations or some other reason not to deleted Will there be a classic Reddit option to optout of the redesign I hope for the best but cant help imagining hardcore redditors like me ending up disappointed with it I just cant imagine a design that is at the time not ugly and densefunctional Could you PLEASE please please make the geospecific view an option and not the default I use to love to see all kinds of new videos when I went on Youtube Now I have to go in private mode to see videos outside of what is similar to what I looked at previously Even then the language preference still limits my view I love that reddit doesnt limit what I see and that the frontpopular page is a reflection of its entire community not just the posts similar to the ones I looked at previously Please please please for the love of God dont pull a Digg  This means were catching abuse earlier and as a result we saw over M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period As a mod all the mods Ive spoken to recently say theyve either a stopped trying to report spam to the admins because nothing happens with most of those reports anyway after the recent loosening in spam what you consider spam or b stopped trying to report most rulebreaking because it now takes so long to get an admin response for most issues by that time the reports too old to do anything meaningful about You can say average response times are going down but thats not a good measure of how tickets are being responded to Your presentation of this as a win rather than a huge negative is just another step in continuation of the rapidly deteriorating relationship between admins and mods Its no wonder so many mods express frustration about the lack of understanding from admins about the needs Whats up with that terrible change to the reports system to make it a terribly cumbersome process that simultaneously encourages people to block people to create their own echo chambers I get that youre launching a bunch of changes without hearing user feedback because you wouldnt have changed the feature releases due to feedback anyway Thats fine not leading people on But reddits corporate voice feels less and less sincere The sites users can tell deleted Wheres the Canary Clause A nugget of wisdom from the infamous Digg v redesign if your new system is a buggy widely hated train wreck that destroys the site archives and betrays the users DONT make it technologically impossible to revert to the old designhttpswebarchiveorgwebhttpatomizedorgtheycanEtgoback Thx for everything you guys have been up too Im quite new to Reddit but I fell in love with it since day  I do have a question who invested the millions and millions in Reddit and did they have requirements This is probably not public information but I think its really interesting Hi uspez With the closure of rspam is there any sort of status on getting mods the tools to fight sock puppets Its still a huge issue in AskReddit and several other of the big subs As helpful as the team has been when we modmail them spammy users the sock puppets are just to plentiful to realistically send them all over Also mobile mod tools please Pretty pretty please I have a question about spam When I use the new report button and select This is spam does that go to your spam team or to the subreddits moderators I ask because there are many subreddits created by spammers to post their own links One example of many httpswwwredditcomrUFCLivetv  A different question about the front page algorithm and moderator abuse As I understand it the front page algorithm is designed to keep subreddits from dominating the front page The more posts a sub has on rallhot the more difficult it is to get a new post there However moderators have found a way around that By removing other posts their sub has in rall they can very quickly promote a new post to the top of reddit You can see an example of this by looking at the moderator logs of revilbuildings and compare to the created timestamps of the subs top posts Is this seen as abuse by Reddit  Still Spez says making money is not our top priority estimating the company spends only about  percent of its resources on its advertising business Huffman declined to share revenue totals The company is also not profitable uspez Im happy for you all but I do not understand your world at all haha Hey Steve In the last round of funding redditcom committed to return  of the value to the community Weve long been trying to find a way for the community to own some of reddit because it is your contributions that help to anchor the site and give it strength Weve actually discussed possible ways to do this for years  Alexis Erik I and our backers at Advance parent company of Conde Nast have tried to come up with creative ways to do it but they never worked out or ran into legal obstacles We think weve come up with a way Led by Sam the investors in this round have proposed to give  of their shares back to the community in recognition of the central role the community plays in reddits ongoing success Were going to need to figure out a bunch of details to make it work but were hopeful Well have more specifics to share about it soon but in the meantime we wanted to mention it here It looks like the cryptocurrency approach had a lot of hair on it but the commitment to do so is out there Where does this stand Contractually and inprocess uelquesogrande Youre seeing fewer mod reports because people are giving up getting help with your new spam rules I reported a guy that posts nothing but blogspam from his own domain many a day which is literally hope you define spam on your support site Answer Weve sunset our spam policy please contact moderators of communities in question Thats why youre getting fewer reports lol Seeing you talk about it as some kind of achievement is just frustrating  Specifically were phasing out Do Not Track which isnt supported by all browsers doesnt work on mobile and is implemented by fewif anyadvertisers and replacing it with our own privacy controls So youre basically saying instead of doing what your users are requesting when they send DNT youre going to just ignore it in lieu of settings that more people will forget to set so you can better monetize their usage of Reddit I mean the excuse youre giving is total bullshit why not just come out and say youve got too many people sending DNT and in a favorable regulatory environment for ignoring it you choose to do so as part of raising revenue going forward Sort of makes all the posturing about Net Neutrality being about your users pretty weak Can you elaborate on M fewer reports With spam shutdown of course reports will drop Is anything being done about the uptick in useless bots throughout the website No community seems to be safe from this recent trend of annoying bots that just repost memes or inject unwanted nonsense into a conversation every time some trigger word is used in a comment Someone in the community created ugoodbotbadbot in an attempt to rank these things but even that has become ripe for abuse and it has no power to enact punishment on the worst bots Some days it feels like Im reading more botspam than actual human input Any chance we can get a sneak peek at Reddit A while back during an AMA you said you would look in to having intraReddit links made on iredditcom or redditcomcompact stay on that version of Reddit instead of popping over to mredditcom I believe you even said that was one of the few changes you personally were still qualified to make Is that something that is possible to do  Were creating more geospecific views of Reddit Please no That is a slippery slope that only leads to censorship and echochambers I come to Reddit because it aggregates content from the entire world If I wanted only local news Id read my local newspaper Im far too late for this party as I am always but Ill ask anyway Is Reddit no longer staying open source And I dont mean that as in you can see our code hosted on place which is also a concern for me as the current state of the master branch is broken in numerous places tests failing continuous integration dead though thats not your fault Travis changed and isnt processing triggers properly on package install and the stable image group has issues with inconsistencies in its python binaries however it is fixable if you guys wanted to but also taking issues and pull requests with actual consideration and consistent scheduled even if infrequent activity Congratulations on the funding What will this money be put towards this applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit some of which ad blockers dont catch Im sorry does someone want to elaborate on how Reddit follows me when Im off Reddit Im aware its possible certainly not that it was standard practice though deleted  An early version of the new design which we saw during our interview looks similar to Facebooks News Feed or Twitters Timeline A neverending feed of content broken up into cards with more visuals to lure people into the conversations hidden underneath That makes me nervous Please dont turn Reddit into another shitty social network We have a lot of perception debt Huffman said from the companys San Francisco headquarters Reddit feels old We dont want to be associated with old We want Reddit to be more visually appealing he explained so when new users come to Reddit they have a better sense of whats there what its for Ill agree that maybe reddit feels a tiny bit outdated but it doesnt feel old It feels efficient It feels like I can get exactly what Im looking for without ever being distracted or frustrated You want something that needs a makeover Look at the Filmtrackscom forum Scoreboardhttpwwwfilmtrackscomscoreboard Reddit doesnt make me hate it the way the Scoreboard does Any chance the APIs will change significantly in the future The concern is reddit pushing its first party apps and web interface could this mean new features being released that arent accessible via API I love my third party reddit apps please keep the API fully featured moving forward please stop reddit from automatically going to the mobile version every time i go on my ipad  Snapshots  This Post  archiveorghttpswebarchiveorghttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsqptzwwithsomuchgoingonintheworldithoughtid

archiveishttpsarchiveisLxK webcitationorghttpwwwwebcitationorgtxBNBZB I am a bot Informabotsuki  Contactmessagecomposetormabotsuki Im sorry but I like many are firmly against the geospecific version of Reddit Many of us fell in love with Reddit primarily because it was global It didnt matter if you were in India like me or France or Korea you saw what was going on in the world The problem that many of us predict is that we will see Reddit become just another Facebook with all new users succumbing to the ecosystem The key ideal of Reddit is that it helped expand the minds of many who came here We all changed our opinions as we interacted with people throughout the globe and expanded our horizons into things we normally would Ill be honest uspez Many of us core users are afraid that new features like removing CSS Reddit profiles and geo specific frontpages will keep users firmly limited to their own ideas and thought processes and change the uniqueness of each community I was ambivalent to the first  changes but this is one where Im legitimately concerned Also theres the problem of new users being turned off by the echo chamber I for example rarely visit rindia despite being an Indian living in India Will I be forced to see political posts and the general flustercuck of my region Because if that happens Id rather just switch to Facebook Key thing is IMO you are limiting the kind of Redditors that made Reddit great in the first place and instead inviting more and more of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp An early version of the new design which we saw during our interview looks similar to Facebooks News Feed or Twitters Timeline A neverending feed of content broken up into cards with more visuals to lure people into the conversations hidden underneath Oh perfect you guys wrote your own Obituary sourcehttpswwwrecodenetredditfundingmillionvaluationstevehuffmanalexisohanian  Our Community Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams are hitting their stride For the first time ever the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive This means you stopped dealing with spam bots since you completely gave up on dealing with spam lately  Otherwise can you at least revert the reporting system to be more streamlined The current system pretty much encourages people to not give better reports or to ignore users or unsubscribe users I dont want people constantly ignoring each other If they are not seeing the bad users theyre being reported less which means we mods dont see them as much We want to stop the rule breaking not hide it behind an ignore wall Also unsubscribing is pointless since if theyre reporting they clearly want to make the subreddit a better place Assuming theyre not someone Id report to the admins for report abuse  This means were catching abuse earlier Why you guys constantly not reacting to the actual literal death threats coming from rphysicalremoval and rthedonald Because those subs still exist after so many death threats have poured from them Heck the phrase physical removal is a death threat spez what are your thoughts on communities such as rShoplifting being on reddit Hi spez Do you think there is something wrong with the sorting algorithm for rall and rtop As an example today a self post with k upvoted  hours old about a moderator passing away was only th on rall httpiimgurcomyYmdfpng and th on rpopular while other posts with k upvotes at most topped the queue httpiimgurcomqcJcwpng I realize a certain subreddit abused stickysself posts to cheat the rall algorithm during the election but I would suggest that the algorithm is now broken in the other direction if a post with k net upvotes such as the one from earlier about a moderator sadly passing away is ranked lower than some  hour old posts with k upvotes Cheers We have a wildly popular web site Lets change it fundamentally just to stay busy What could go wrong I understand if some tweaking is necessary but Reddit is fine as it is And since other similar inquiries are still going unanswered Ill ask again why profile pages This is the most disappointing development plan Ive heard WTF do you guys want to be Facetwitgram for Were here specifically to get away from that selfcentric heyeverybodylookatme crap Currently the only place that is welcome on reddit is in rAMA Ive always loved reddit because it isnt about who or where you are Its entirely about what you post and what you say You can make a comment and get a reply from a housewife in Spain or a crackhead in Detroit or a professor of astronomy or a priest or a cop or a yrold high school student it is the ultimate melting pot where all opinions are presented side by side and given an equal chance to be heard regardless of who the person giving them is Channeling people into profile pages will ruin that conversational melting pot forever And changing content based upon a users region is really a massive disaster IMO I want reddit to be an unfiltered international discussion place to make snarky comments about Putin and have Russian folks reply I want to hear opinions about how assbackwards the US health care system is from the rest of the world which has managed to avoid the greedy profiteering that we embrace Please dont ruin these things just to stay busy or make  more money Id back paid subscriptions before Id get on board with what youre proposing I feel like we should get rid of advertising as a cultural media concept It creates tons of wasted space and personally the more I see an ad the more likely I am to boycott that product or company Plenty of companies who dont make garbage products seem to be doing just fine without wasting everyones time Its an expenditure which helps nobody Certainly not the consumer who is expected to pay for ad expenses at the end of the day Do you think you can work more to stop upvote bots Diggv was the day I joined Reddit Take care with Reddit Will you do anything to start actively enforcing the no asking for upvotes rule Its getting ridiculous  Reddit We see what you did there Hope it doesnt turn out like that other four Will there be a setting to make it so reddit only tracks for ads on reddit and not allow it to track what you do off of it The video push is obviously for ad revenue and to keep users on the reddit domain But why does Reddit NEED to have a video experience Does reddit think they can be a better provider than youtube or vimeo or streamable Why cant your DNTalternative be used with DNT simultaneously Sure the whole ecosystem needs to buy in So unless theres some prohibitive cost preventing you from staying in the ecosystem why leave and hurt DNT overall Didnt the idea of geospecific reddit views receive overwhelmingly negative feedback Doesnt look good guys if youre going to ask listen Id rather you just not even ask than pretend to care to sate us Are we going to do anything with vote brigrading from some particularly large subreddits Or is that what this AntiEvil team is doing We have reddiquite and everyone should have to abide by it How the hell do you secure funding when rthedonald and others are still around Insert mandatory discussion about whether or not there actually is going as much going on as we think or that it is just the fact that we just have more information input these days Congratulations on the funding The traffics is also very nice greatly enjoyed the suddenly higher counts D Are you guys ever going to at least acknowledge the ridiculous amount of shilling and sockpuppeting going on on Reddit Do the investors you meet ever bring up the fact that Reddit is now the host to the largest gathering of white supremacists on the internet See reuropeannationalism rwhiterights runcensorednews rdebatealtright and many others As an example  here is one example of many from the top mod of runcensorednews on jewish people I am a Jewish nationalist first and foremost but Jews are white so naturally I recognize the logic behind white nationalism Jews are not white you fucking k Stop being a fucking leech for once in your life httpsnpredditcomruncensorednewscommentsavgjewishmilitantsseekwhitenationalistalliancedfjmr Any plans to improve the search engine I have a question about the search function on Reddit it seems it isnt working as good as it used to Any plans on making this better  they typically did this by posting real reputable news articles Those BASTARDS Why dont you publish the full list of those accounts with a special tag for easy identification Lots of nasty arguments can be prevented So on what scale exactly does Reddit start to view something as a troublesome coordinated interference rHailCorporate for instance discusses content that seems to be to be people acting as unwitting advertisers for a product An example of a legitimate case of thishttpswwwredditcomrEyebleachcommentszwlblittlehedgehogcamper where part of an ad campaign developed for Coleman ended up close to the top of rall because it was cute and shared on rEyebleach as a nonad isnt an inherently bad thing But what about posts or even groups that seem to gain just as much traction out of nowhere for other similar reasons seemingly spontaneously Look at rKeanuBeingAwesome Created  months ago right before concrete news started to trickle out and rumors started to form surrounding Bill and Ted Face the Music officially announced to be in preproduction on May th  Even in the welcoming post after the sub was formedhttpswwwredditcomrKeanuBeingAwesomecommentspobzkwelcometorkeanubeingawesome the top comment was about how many posts had been popping up on Reddit which were clear promo shots The promo shots at the time were so prevalent on Reddit that somehow the sub created to share similar pictures started trendinghttpswwwredditcomrtrendingsubredditscommentspucntrendingsubredditsfor in  hours and already had almost k subs And sure enough it continued to trendhttpswwwredditcomrtrendingsubredditssearchqKeanuBeingAwesomerestrictsron on two other months since Its even had an AMAhttpswwwredditcomrKeanuBeingAwesomecommentschpnhiimgeemaliklintonidirectedkeanureevesin with a director that worked with Reeves on Daughter of God Now the reason I brought up that sub particularly is that back when this sub and all the Keanu Being Awesome pictures first started suddenly popping up on Reddit happened to be exactly when one of the original writers Ed Solomon openly said they were struggling to come up with the funding to make the movie happen Studios werent convinced the film would release well in theaters both internationally and in the USAhttpwwwdigitalspycommoviesnewsabillandtedtitleplotkeanureevesfacethemusicmovie Sorry for that link being annoying it was an exclusive interview Does Reddit regularly look at stuff that suddenly gains traction to see if theres manipulation happening Even if it isnt some conspiracy or ad campaign aimed at shaping public sentiment even if its just the internet being the internet suddenly turning things into memes does Reddit care enough to investigate trends or sudden interest regularly for potential manipulation Again back to that first Welcome To post I linked although the by a huge margin most upvoted comment was about how many obvious promo shots were going around there did seem to be a lot of genuine excitement around the creation of the sub Im not suggesting that the entire sub is one giant ad campaign to help make a Bill and Ted sequel happen but using that sub and how quickly it started trending as an example does Reddit care about people manipulating what Reddit users as a whole see Whether its a single ad or an entire community where does Reddit draw the line from this could be the internet being the internet and start thinking this could be manipulation Just to be clear Im not asking for a specific linenottobecrossed or for a list of things you look for but what can Reddit users do to keep an eye out for things that might not be genuine good faith interest With the sub I mentioned for instance it could be entirely good faith from the community thats interested in a celebrity that seems to be a genuinely decent human being It could be mostly that but sparked off by a PR firm with a targeted ad campaign It could even be in its entirety a PR run effort What can Reddit users do to actually determine whether something is on the front page because people care or because people were paid to care On our end we just cant know without Reddit stepping in and actually investigating because no matter how fishy something looks maybe we just dont get it Thats the internet for you Also on the other end what is Reddit doing to stop censorship Its one thing to look at stuff that suddenly pops up with a hint of suspicion but what about the stuff that just doesnt get discussed because all discussion surrounding it is quashed in its early stages In the most popular newsworldnews subs for instance there have been more than a few stories that just kept being shut down as they were happening where all threads discussing it were locked and taken down and one comment after another deleted Is Reddit doing anything to help deal with this On the one hand maybe some subs are under moderated and they need to lock down threads to deal with a huge influx of people surrounding an issue because of the large interest in the story But if thats the case surely making discussion impossible and deleting one thread after another is the wrong way to go about handling it whenever people actually care On the other hand if its not a lack of moderators but specific moderators trying to control what people are allowed to discuss or care about intentionally stopping some stories from being discussed isnt that a big issue that Reddit should know about and take action to prevent Maybe thats okay on small subs where the rules clearly state to avoid some types of content but on large news subs people arent allowed to discuss news Especially when dealing with large default communities when does Reddit view selectivity in content as an issue of manipulation rather than a general trend in ideologyleaning within those communities and what can regular users do about it if they think there is some kind of manipulation going on TLDR  Sorry for the wall What can Reddit users do to help prevent manipulation What is Reddit doing to help users identify manipulation What is Reddits stance on the potential of manipulation when dealing with sudden trends and with sudden silence This post right here is gonna be looked at when people go back to view how the downfall of Reddit started Obviously its started already but this post by the admins saying anything against the US governments wishes is basically considered bannable is just ridiculous No wonder TD is still around Im just curious whats the difference between this and people from other countries just posting their opinions on the internet When does it become an Influence OperationTM  Why does this just seem like clever marketing  Technical markers  not the content that was the target here  behaviours of the accounts collectively This doesnt look good on Reddits part What possible technical markers exist other than accounts being registered under the same IP and repeatedly interacting with each others posts can definitively suggest that they did not for example belong to a small group of activists in Iran trying to highlight activities that the US would rather not be highlighted This looks like political steering to me Even in the FireEye report it is suggested that this influence is being used to demonstrate the poor actions taken by Saudi Arabia the US Israel et al of late With this in mind these actions look more like a coverup or an attempted one at least and less like management of rogue accounts You know what could change that Utter transparency Hiding behind closed doors does not help matters What would help is independent users of the site either verifying or vilifying these actions based on concrete evidence And yeah I realize a trusted reporter system may cause some casualtiesrBestOfReports Remember everyone report  super mega ultra downvote Thanks for protecting us from checks notes reports of civilian casualties in Yemen I dunnowhats the problem with accounts posting real news articles Just because they align with something shouldnt be grounds for suspension alone Some of the examples of odd news links appear as outliers Shouldnt people be left to discern what is true or not Trusted Reporter System is how Digg died Also  were censoring reports from legitimate sources that publicize civilian deaths in Yemen and are admitting that the system may cause some casualties Strange how the comments in here sway more in defense of free speech and not banning conservative platforms Wish the rest of Reddit reflected the same organic comment sections What really rubs me the wrong way about this is that it feels like truth is being used as a weapon Youve said that they were posting real reputable articles to change public opinion Does the value of this information change based on who says it If the information is true why does it matter who says it The argument that these account are being banned for coordinating seems lacking as well Im sure at this point most political groups in the United States have people trying to change public opinion on social media Are these accounts being banned as well What about a Canadian group trying to change NAFTA opinions Or a UK group trying to change brexit opinions Where is the line between acceptable forms of influence and inauthentic influence What differentiates these accounts from any account or group of accounts that holds a specific opinion on a set of matters and participates on Reddit as a function of that opinion Isnt Reddit about sharing and influence Im not defending anything this group has said or done especially as I havent got a clue what these accounts were posting Rather Im just trying to understand how you draw the line in what you do and dont censor I think you need to be clear to your community of users on what warrants investigation such that you avoid any level of unfair censorship Dont be China From the fire eye article which btw does not confirm anything coming from Iran and does not mention the Iran govt These narratives include antiSaudi antiIsraeli and proPalestinian themes as well as support for specific US policies favorable to Iran such as the USIran nuclear deal JCPOA God forbid i feel like im living in some kind of bizarre nightmare reality as i see everyone cheer this on its absurd under  accounts posting a few stories is not a big deal and i dont even see any proof this was the work of the Iranian govt its a hysterical witch hunt over nothing and you seek to teach users to deal with foreign interference but They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen These articles would often be posted to farleft or farright political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles all they were doing was spreading facts and yet this is some kind of propaganda ring so what we should ignore stories of the USAs evil just because iranians posted to it and if they are all posting in anti usa subs anyhow how is this propaganda iran is trying to make leftists who already hate us foreign policy saudia arabia and Israel hate them more youre just being bootlickers for the status quo at this point shame on you Fuck This Shit So if I am vocally antiwar I can get banned If I speak up because I am pro Palestine and anti Israel as fuck I can get banned If I speak up because I happen to be anti American imperialism I can be banned  uspez Let me get this straight  They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen These articles would often be posted to farleft or farright political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles Theyre being accused of posting factual content to interested communities and youre going to openly communicate about the hidden actions youre taking that are over our heads and over our pay grades Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you but this is a battle we have been fighting and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future And of course well continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects I understand you would probably prefer this as us taking this as something along the lines of Because of the election of Trump weve been actively thwarting Russian influence on Reddit and on top of that we just took out an ISIS related Iranian Intelligence campaign to radicalize users of reddit But neither way to spin this is inaccurate its just a matter of perception or am I missing something This is one of those posts where you sort by controversial This post is a disaster so much disturbing things are happening on this thread and I am not talking about the FireEye report Its the way Reddit is approaching this Banning users subs having suspect Report Systems lack of transparency on the different dimensions of newsarticlesopinions and what not Its troubling and i suspect in coming years its threads like these which will be be linked to highlight how the Reddit management fucked shit up Reddit has no system of contentopinion controlmanagement and yet it wants to and worse still is orchestrating it naturally haphazardly and ineffectively even more so going forward This will not turn out good What are some tell tale signs that an account is not legit I am worried by just how normal these accounts seem How can we ever hope to weed out influencers who subvert social platforms like this one if they are so good at hiding it Can neural algorithms even deal with this So youre introducing a system of trusted users who can report anything that may seem like a coordinated effort regardless of whether or not he information is factual Yet you dont care about deliberately advertising posts as a matter of fact you shove sponsored posts down our throats You constantly are trying to shove the redesign and your shitty app down our throats time and time again have refused to listen to the community youre trying to turn Reddit into some disgusting combination of Facebook and Twitter What about nonstate run influence groups Like political parties or corporations Do you have ways to detect them influencing discussions on the website reputable news This seems like a real slippery slope So a group posts factual news articles that gain attention because of this group but its also popular because users unrelated agree with its content How do you ensure that your not just silencing a group of like minded people or perhaps a group of like minded people that all live at a university so the technical markers are very similar It just seems like its almost impossible to apply policy even handedly without letting staff or leadership bias influence the decision making process Edit we all know what the solution is but we dont want to admit it its removing anonymity for ever single user and anyone that pays for advertising This is more or less done with television paid campaign ads or when youre watching a known bias network If they posted credible articles that aligned with their beliefs whats the problem here This sets an unfortunate precedent  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low some of them were able to gain more traction They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen These articles would often be posted to farleft or farright political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles Whats the problem here These tricky bastards posted real reputable news articles that promoted or supported their political views to political subreddits How is this different from what the rest of us do if we even do that well What exactly is Reddit for if its not exactly that sort of thing Is Reddit just for Murricans So those accounts  dont do much but post news articles and  often dont stick to one end of the political spectrum from what your example accounts show Is that a general trend youve noticed among astroturfers I looked through those account and I dont see anything wrong with them Reddit is becoming USA mouthpiece Rnews is American news If someone started North Korea news sub it would probably taken down I thought Reddit was interesting but now I see its thinly veiled American propaganda America is destroying the world and you are an enabler Interesting timing considering the United States is trying to find reasons to go to war with Iran Do you really think we believe that youre trying to help us users of Reddit By controlling the conversation If youre going to ban proIran accounts then please ban proIsrael accounts and Russian  and American war propaganda while youre at it please People from Iran can no longer post real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans political narrative Why do you persist in claiming that karma is a useful measure of an accounts influence Everyone knows it is meaningless Furthermore this post makes the implication that news articles about mass civilian deaths are some kind of conspiracy theory that you would rather not have on Reddit TLDR Reddit caught Iran shilling without paying Reddit first Sopeople with political agendas push their own viewpoint Maybe some of this is going over my head but isnt this kind of politicking normal So youre saying youre a primarily US supporting platform That this sort of stuff is okay but only if in support of US policy Because its kind of an open secret that nothing is organically a top post any more Ive heard twitch streamers openly proclaim that they have to brigade stuff to get it exposure And thats not even going into suspicious activity getting user comments downvoted to obscurity on these posts This entire platform of reddit is made to encourage this People downvote because they disagree yet its treated as if the downvotes are whether or not the item is pertinent And so its subsequently hidden So announcements like this that youre actually doing something are a load of bull The fact that people from Iran have been singled out is likely the true aim of this announcement Ok so my take away from reading this is that Reddit users should not post articles reputable or otherwise critical of the foreign policies of the US or its allies else you will be considered a possible foreign influencer God forbid bringing these issues to the eyes of the American people and others throughout the world that participate with Reddit This reminds me of the days of the USSR when all the US had to do was broadcast the truth into Soviet countries via Radio Free Europe in order to destabilize them The Soviet government bent over backwards to stop that as well Protip if your foreign policy and the foreign policies of your allies arent morally bankrupt you dont have to worry about foreign influencers reposting reputable news sources on web sites Its only when you are trying to hide your actions from your populous and the world that it becomes a problem What specifically are you saying these accounts did wrong Is it against reddit rules for foreigners to participate in US political discussion Were the articles misleadingspammy Where do you draw the line between propaganda and people posting what they care about Did these accounts do anything beyond posting information Whats the difference between this and online activism Please accept this as an honest question Dear Reddit this is a disgusting way to silence the antiwar and antiinterventionist RedditorsIraniansMiddle Easterners I mean if i was living abroad and went to a US forum what the fuck else would I talk about other than US politics and policy Here are some points that stood out to me   They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS Is this perhaps because ISIS and the civil war in Syria were in neighboring countries  They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen I dont think you have to be Iranian or from Iran to have an antiinterventionist stance on the war in Yemen The coalition forces are killing civilians in Yemen left and right and no news is being reported on the millions of displaced people And then theres also the issue of FireEye  a security company that has struggled to turn a profit since  Seems like theyve found a new way to make money after their last CEO left the company in early  ExFireEye CEO Dave DeWalt Joins Israeli Security Startuphttpfortunecomfireeyeceodavedewaltisraelisecuritystartupclaroty So They posted verifiable and factual articles and comments that just aligned with Irans interest That seems really common of what everyone does deleted They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen And thats wrong because You seem to be under the impression that the Saudis have the right narrative right down to glossing over the fact that Iranian posting re ISIS is all antiISIS EDIT I was permabanned for ban evasion despite doing no such thing and they only banned my subreddit rRussophobes which is extremely suspicious and seems motivated by my criticism of Saudi Arabia seriously since when did mods ban subreddits for having no mods rredditrequest has a number right now Why only ban me when I criticise Admin agenda This seems like a really convenient context to accidentally delete accounts that dont promote a desired agenda What are you doing about Shareblue Or are you guys making too much money from that endeavor to touch it I dont like this Were rapidly entering an era where propaganda and influence is about spreading misinformation as fast as possible and youre banning accounts which post legitimate sources to niche subs that happen to fit a narrative What about thedonald half their sources arent even real What about Israel who have been known to employ influencers for years What about subs dedicated to particular countries or ideologies Are we going to ban LateStageCapitalism for being socialist de for being proGerman What counts as an external influence and which of them are to be banned Half the posts on rgaming are advertisements in some shape or form I certainly dont want to be influenced by those and they are far more insipid than simply posting an article about Saudis blowing up a bus full of children with American manufactured arms Negative sentiment towards Saudi Arabia and Israel Is that supposed to be a bad thing Wtf What even is foreign on the socalled frontpage of the internet Clearly the people running this website have no idea of how to act neutrally  This group focused on steering the narrative This is what every entity on Reddit is doing You are steering the narrative right now  They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative Youre pointing out yourself that the information was from reputable sources and yet you are depicting it as some sort of propaganda that needs to be eliminated  Most of the accounts had karma below snip statistics So apparently the fact that they gained traction is a problem But nowhere do you claim that this traction was gained from vote brigading or bots or whatever other illegitimate way of getting votes  accounts is not enough to get a post in view of a lot of users They were simply spreading a narrative that got picked up by legitimate users Not that I personally think you can call those more legitimate than the influencers accounts This is just madness I will never be able to see Reddit as an independent entity again In fact I was probably a fool to ever think it was in the first place It feels like the admins are either pushing their own political agenda or too stupid to realise they are blocking free speech Youve got western astroturfing campaigns practically running Reddit there are mods who have hundreds of subreddits mods who run your major subs as their own personal state half the userbase hates the other half some so much so that they regularly wish death on them and youre making a victory out of shutting down a handful of Iranian accounts God you people are fucking useless This is a media war Saudi VS Iran You eliminated one side now make sure to go for the other There are hundreds of thousands of bots and fake accounts employed by Saudi Arabia as well deleted  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen These articles would often be posted to farleft or farright political communities Ive checked your examples and while some have been very successful and active in leftwing communities Ive not seen a single instance which this was true for a rightwing community Care to elaborate Suck my dick Spez hope you choke on NATO propaganda Literally banning people for sharing news of the murder of innocents in Yemen and Palestine by the Fascist Apartheid state of Israel and the islamist absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia Im disgusted by the liberal bootlicking of the reddit staff And yall claim to be pro free speech kek We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency scope and complexity Were investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills Skills they have acquiredyou know the drill Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you but this is a battle we have been fighting and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future Simply epic All hail Big Brother and the Ministry of Love It seems like the Iranian government deserves some thanks for consistently posting good content Are there any plans to out suspected rings on Reddit that are shown to have official backing from foreign and domestic governments or operators in the future I feel that a dedicated team producing reports on these incidents would be prudent moving forward You wont please everyone and of course we would be sceptical but Reddit has obviously played a massive part over the past years in influencing opinion on contentious political issues Knowing what topics attracted these actions and seeing data that supports your claims would go a long way in building faith in the Reddit staff I hope you do something about the shills that were on rnews every day months before the election Youd open up a thread and see  of the comments were made by a single person on a week old account And it happened every day Theyd dump their account after a day of usage and switch to another alt The mods of rnews did not take any steps to stop them  They did not ban them after it was reported to the mods  They did not set AutoMod restrictions preventing new accounts or accounts with low comment karma from posting Aside from that thank you for the report Cool Next look into how the mods of subs like rworldnews and rnews actively influence what kind of topics can be seen and discussed I guess its the crime of the century for Iran to post its often reasonable views on the USSaudiIsraeli power bloc but its okay for the US to own propaganda radio stations and use the CIA to overthrow legitimate governments An extremely curated handful of post is pretty telling that this is just propaganda to make it clear that only certain views are allowed on reddit at all anymore Its very sad that a website that is supposed to be community based has fallen to the level of engineering conspiracy theories to justify hamfisted censorship of dangerous ideas You and the entire reddit team should be ashamed of yourselves uKeyserSosa  So whats the difference between these guys and other groups like Shareblue that are paid and coordinated deleted Apparently White Flag by Dido makes Iranian influences want to crank up the tunes httpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsfavwhatsongmakesyouwanttoturnupthevolumedielxycontexthttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsfavwhatsongmakesyouwanttoturnupthevolumedielxycontext Did anyone believe any of that Im sorry this is such a load of fecal matter The US Israel Russia and China all do the same thing and you make a post about Iran  accounts I would bet my life Israel alone has an exponentially higher number of PR drones and you do absolutely nothing about them US Russia and China as well Reddit is a sick sick place now This is some shady stuff how do you guys sleep at night knowing you are supporting a parade of propaganda for a select few while demonizing others Im honestly ashamed I still come back for the cat pics now  Unlike our last post on foreign interference the behaviors of this group were different While the overall influence of these accounts was still low some of them were able to gain more traction They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen These articles would often be posted to farleft or farright political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles Doubleplus good brother but what of the chocolate ration Will it be increasing anytime soon Normal decent human Hmm maybe we shouldnt bomb Iran Reddit Admins HOLY SHIT GET A LOAD OF THESE RUSSIAN IRANIAN BOTS I mean I can only comment on what it looks like but it looks an awful lot like the Reddit Admins are astroturfing their own website to prep and condition Americans into unjustifiable imperialist hostilities toward Iran and Russia TIL I should be afraid to share my opinion freely even on Reddit So is Reddit the thought police dictating what information people are allowed to see now What is wrong with them doing the below which is quoted above They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen Reddit moderators have been reporting this activity to you all for months over a year and you ignored them Why dont you ever take the reports of your on ground volunteer moderators seriously What actions are you going to take in the future to address this Volunteers found Irans propaganda effort on Reddit  but their warnings were ignored More than a year before Facebook and Twitter announced that they had discovered a new foreign influence campaign tied to Iranian state media a group of volunteer moderators on Reddit noticed a peculiar pattern of submissions Some Reddit users were repeatedly posting divisive political rhetoric from a group of obscure news websites That effort led a Reddit moderator from California and a small team of volunteers to investigate Using publicly available data about who started the news websites they were able to find evidence of a wideranging propaganda network across the social news site with ties to Iran httpswwwnbcnewscomtechtechnewsvolunteersfoundiranspropagandaeffortreddittheirwarningsweren It didnt sound like anything nefarious was discovered just Iranians trying to promote an Iranian agenda on a global news aggregate website Am I wrong deleted I suggest you investigate the moderators in rnews Im not sure I fully understand If theyre just posting links to factual articles that are supporting their agenda how is that different to redditors from the US posting articles that support an American agenda Oh come on They were posting actual news about whats going on that just happens to be antiAmerican because they talk about the US bombing the hell out of the innocent This is just plain censorship As a Brit are my posts foreign interference Is Reddit a USonly platform Do you acknowledge that there are other legitimate perspectives That some of them do not align with US interests That for all their faults Iran does have legitimate points to make Does this have anything to do with the fact US Army  Star General Wesley Clark revealed a  Zionist plot that includes a list of countries the US Dept of Defense planned to take out and Iran is about the only country left on that list that has not since already been taken out or attempted to be taken out and that Syria was also on that list and the US and Israel are therefore directly responsible for the atrocities in Syria carried out by their terrorist groups including ISIS and Al Qaeda that they created funded and directed to attempt the overthrow of the Syrian Government and that the only country that stepped up and put a stop to that is Russia so am I right in assuming you people are as criminally evil as the government you seek to protect because if your purpose is to prevent people in the countries targeted by the US Government from speaking out against it then I hope your children dont grow up to realize what a total disgrace to humanity you are TIL posting real news is bad and trying to convince people over to your side is bad Good job reddit Youre not the though police Huh quite the irony here uspez no Jesus Fucking Christ Reddit died with Aaron Swartz Have my last downvote and enjoy the goddamn dystopian nightmare you are hellbent on creating  accounts I mean not to be a dick or anything but who cares Theres tabloids and shitty media posted all over this site and garbage propaganda from left right and center Whats any different about these  accounts I dont understand this policing shit are people so stupid that they need this protection What happened to doing research yourself and not listening to random morons on the internet Its a sad day when we have to pretend the silencing or  propaganda artists on a platform is some kind of victory or even matters in the grand scheme of things This shit reminds me of the drug war and all the reasons that failed miserably and fucked up our society  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low some of them were able to gain more traction They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen So posting nonfake news that exposes the crimes of the US imperial government is against reddit policy Youre basically admitting youre a mouthpiece for the US government Good to know Banned for posting reputable news articles that dont support saudi arabia or israel lmao  Last week FireEye made an announcement regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains Irans influence operation  bad Constant US propaganda  good So when are you fucks going to admit you sell subreddits to super PACs that allows them to internally drive narratives You know in the interest of transparency and all Meanwhile its pretty plain to see that there are pro Trump shills everywhere on Reddit yet you guys do nothing Youre just acting like youre trying when you really dont give a fuck So anyone critical of US Foreign Policy is an agent Basically its censorship of critical views under guise of fighting foreign influence If you are serious about fighting foreign agents trying to influence public opinion why not ban users linked to Israel Cool so any commonly interested group linked to a particular region or country that is for whatever reason free to use the platform is then summarily executed as interfering with the normal course of free posting to said site This sounds like some silly attempt at Jack Dorsey style explanation we dont shadowban but using this definition we might be  TIL Im an Iranian bot They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative Uh okay Its important that people realize that goes on I dont disagree with that But posting real reputable news articles is more akin to lobbying than interference Theres so much insane garbage thats completely madeup that gets posted on various political subs This isnt stuff that comes in as real reputable news articles Its plainly propaganda from Russia and Russian aligned interests here in the US And that crap keeps on coming and coming but this is what gets an announcement about gaining traction while the Russian influence campaign was brushed off as ineffective which seems pretty hard to believe I honestly dont think you give a fuck about interference because it doesnt affect your bottom line If anything it probably improves it since it gives us something more to post and bitch about Theres no actual motivation for you to do anything about it is there You care more about the illusion of democracy and making a profit off of it more than you care about actually working to preserve it in the outside world  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low some of them were able to gain more traction They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles that happened to align with Irans preferred political narrative  for example reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen God forbid posting real news And whos to say the FireEye report is not instigating schooling the population gaslighting manipulate someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity Sincerely Amador If accounts are widely popular for posting quality content why ban them just because their bias is allegedly proIran xB Why not ban Canadians too xB This site a is a reactionary shithole This is politically motivated and retarded in so many levels deleted tldr  real news we dont like is against the rules They typically did this by posting real reputable news articles Why is criticizing Saudi Arabia the US and Israel seen as bad There are many extremely valid criticisms of each country How will you know if someone criticizing any of these countries is a real user or not This seems far more recent than the long known and reported Israeli influence operation Internet MegaphonehttpswwwjpostcomIsraelIsraelsnewestPRweaponTheInternetMegaphone and subsequent iterations it is well known that the Saudis are investing in similar tactics especially since the ascension of Mohammed Bin Salman So when are you going to act against those probably far more effective influence operations This seems like the kind of thing that should be done with due process reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen THANK YOU Reddit for cleansing the influence of these political narratives I am glad that you support the House of Saud and the Unites States in its efforts to shape political perceptions These reports that publicize civilian deaths in Yemen are not to be seen by Americans Thank you again True Americans you are Yeah Cant trust stories from the guardian Reuters the independent the hill or the telegraph Clearly trying to influence us with fake news Wait No Dont delete me Ive got shit loads of karma what about accounts that spew propaganda in favour of usaisrael etc  wheres THAT crackdown  All this work and yet you wont do anything about the Subs that routinely encourage death threats against politicians and have spawned real world violence None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit With all due respect none of us give a shit about ads Where we dont actively filter them through adblock programs we skip right past them in the feed Ads on reddit dont influence opinions anywhere near to the same extent that comments do Ads arent the issue astroturfing is This is outrageous policing and outright censorship How do you define foreign influence Is Reddit USonly now Its scary and closeminded that Americans in the top comments just patriotically swallowed this in full I get that Americans are traumatised by Russian meddling their domestic election so now any foreign meddling smells threat But  US meddling in other countries domestic elections is old news not that an eye for an eye is justified but sadly youre not immune to the consequences of your own foreign policies and  this isnt a domestic election that that these accounts are meddling with theyre trying to influence US foreign policies that probably affect their lives are these accounts really the most problematic accounts on Reddit that you have to make a big deal out of to paint yourselves the hero I come from a region where democracy is branded as foreign influence because it doesnt align with the governments agenda because fucking hell even if a concept is valid as long as its foreign its a threat and it should be censored This is what China has been doing and now seems like the US is doing as well Lets not even mention how these countries own foreign policies are usually invasive and unethical themselves Can you not see the parallel here This is the same authoritarian shit Reddit is pulling banning views drawn from reputable news site just because it doesnt fit the Reddit Americanised political spectrum Downright revolting god forbid nonAmericans having freedom of speech In this case not everyone in the world agrees with US foreign policies In other cases not everyone is automatically repulsed by the concept of the commies and not everyone agrees with Israel politically and immediately risks being called antisemitic Reddit is supposed to be the front page of the internet its supposed to if anything open US eyes to the world Now it looks more like its the front page of the US disappointing I dont know why I thought otherwise It doesnt even make sense if you say these small number of accounts need to be banned because theyre a coordinated effort This is inconsistent with what mods have been doing across Reddit Much bigger coordinated efforts have been made in rpolitics during the election and no one did anything And how about rHailCorporate cases rKeanuBeingAwesome You going to start banning any coordinated organisation that doesnt fit your neat little black and white bubble ELI reminder httpswwwredditcomrChapoTrapHousecommentsunhrredditpromotingwarwithiran who is paying yall for this This is just one group There are likely many others are you just going to wait for an outside group to do your research for you before looking into it yourself Or will you try to actively search these groups out and make reddit a better place Based on the redesign I dont think you are interested in making reddit a better place at all so I think I know the answer Reasons never to trust reddit as a news sources  So a foreigner cant post negative news about US What So you guys are banning people for posting the news So agree with the Americans or get banned then Im out fuck this information control If I wanted a shit narrative fed to me by faceless asshole deeming whats true then I would turn on the news The whole internet is going straight to shit with this behaviour modification in fucking everything Whats the point of the internet if we are installing narrative gatekeepers But the monsanto shills are okay Go fuck yourself reddit people with a brain on both sides of the political fence know what this is really about YouTube and reddit and even google are fucking temporary something else better is going to come along Orwell  Governments Politicians and News Papers have been influencing public opinion for hundreds of years Its up to the people to try see through the propaganda and lies to the facts of the matter Apparently on Reddit you think you need to protect grown adults from real reputable news articles that might influence them to engage critical thinking instead of blindly believing a prowar  promiddle eastern interventionist narrative This announcement comes across like you want to maintain a narrative that USA  Israel  Good Guys Syria  Palestine  Bad Guys I thought Reddit was a Global community encouraging critical thinking and discussion and not about pushing one nations narrative over another If we are not allowed to post news articles that criticise Israel or the USAs pro war narrative let us know Open transparency is sorely lacking in the real world after all  deleted Israel has a much more expansive betterfunded admitted and fully dedicated intelligence effort to propagandize across ALL social media platforms see Hasbara This includes paying private citizens to actively downplay ethnic cleansing and apartheid in occupied territories support its yearslong campaign of vitriol against Iran and help cover for Saudi Arabia and its illegal war in Yemen What is Reddit doing to stop what is massively bigger than the efforts of the Iranian government to disseminate its preferred political narrative It is fashionable and easy to score political points against exaggerated and existential Iranian threats Targeting voiceless Iranians under an international scantions regime is an absolutely norisk proposition for Reddit When will Reddit take the first steps towards stopping more significant operations including organized online social media propaganda that targets Iran Most of it originating from Israel We all know that this whole thing is nonsense  you are hypocrites and nothing more So when will the dumpsterfire over at rpolitics be taken care of Everyone of us who was around before the election knows about the almost overnight switch in narratives on that sub Go back and look at the old posts from that sub then compare it to what it is now Its insulting that you think were dumb enough not to notice the change in content It very obviously went from probernieanti establishment to proclintonestablishment worship in a matter of days Now every single post and comment questioning democrats or their policy in general gets downvoted to oblivion You can pretend to give a shit about astroturfing all you want as long as rpolitics continues down its current path you admins are full of shit Rnews and rworldnews get the honorable mention Hello Shareblue we all know youre still here Edit who remembers the day during the net neutrality circlejerk where literally every states subreddit had a post up on rall showing us which leftist politician voted to saved your internet rights and which Republican voted against net neutrality Totally organic yeah right Its happening right before our eyes yet the sheep are here asking for more censorship of right wing subs as if the left leaning ones arent riddled with Shareblue shills and low effort bots too So is the US paying Reddit to censor antiUS foreign policy accountsposts Because it feels like this is an identical operation to what youre saying these accounts did Lol and what about the other  influence operations ongoing on Reddit I cant help but feel like there are bigger fish to fry when it comes to Nations attempting to influence the masses via propaganda on Reddit So is Reddit going to do something about paid Israeli abd Saudi astroturfing Oh thats right you only care if its one of Americas perceived enemies I think biggest problem Ive seen in the last year is that posts arent MOVING So when a post gets to the front page it just stays there for a whole day In the past there was a lot more movement so there was naturally more variety I would like to see posts moving a bit more quickly and that would probably help with keeping one dominant voice from becoming so overwhelming Any news about plans to get rid of the concept of default subs It seems they cause numerous problems and you mentioned in your last announcement about rnews that you werent a fan of them either Hey uspez how do you feel about the new Stickied Posts being used only for announcement texts disrupting services in subreddits like rScenesFromAHat where they can no longer post their Scenes Of The Week properly I for one am sad  Hey Spez Id like to propose an alternative to rAll which would be something like rOutstanding Sorting by most upvotes is great But what I would really want to see are those posts that really exceed the expectations of their respective subreddits Lets say that rPics regularly has posts that get to  points Obviously those will show up in rAll even if theyre nothing special Its just because rPics is so big and the top post is bound to get that high But at the same time lets say that the rPicsOfUnusualBirds subreddit not sure if thats a real thing normally gets only  votes per post but a post today got  votes Whoa Double what they regularly get That must mean that its a really good submission right Thats the kind of content I want to see The overall basis of it should be votes by percentage of subscribers or something along those lines it needs to take in the population of the subreddit into account Obviously there would need to be some control like if a submission in rPicsOfUnusualBirds was linked to in a popular rAskreddit post to prevent brigading style stuff But that can all be tweaked just think about the concept  Pros of this system as opposed to rAll  Will allow for better subreddit discovery because small subreddits will be able to get on the list more easily  Takes away the advantage of massive default subreddits  Cant be dominated by one subreddit regularly unless it continually exceeds its previous records which would be really difficult  Would really highlight the very best of Reddit or the most important news Do these changes only apply to HOT If we go to ralltop will we still see a true listing of what is on top of rall todayyearhouretc I like that theres more NSFW content on my front page now Finding all sorts of new subs How will this affect when an event occurs and a subreddit has a lot of activity Ex rSports or sport specific subs during playoffsfinals rnews when something happens before it gets rolled into a megathread rDOTA  during The Internationals etc Will we be seeing less of those on rall when that happens deleted Having a filter for nsfw for all or a separate rall would be nice Many of us slack at work and brows reddit at least speaking for myself it would be nice if there was less to no NSFW on a version of rall edit I appreciate the advice I actually use RES everywhere but work but I do browse reddit at lunch and breaks and occasionally not lunch and breaks But if you are the frontpage of the internet new users will not know how to filter things uSpez Ive been a user for the better part of a decade on a different account and I think I speak for all of reddits legacy users and even some of the newer ones when I say its high time we brought back rreddit as a place for meta discussion about the site itself ModMail is a copout that hides all upperlevel discussions from the community and waiting for rannouncements to post something relevant to the current issues plaguing this site is only hindering the ability of the community to suggest and promote fixes and upgrades to reddit Give us a place to discuss reddit that is free from onesided political drama where we can come together and say things like Hey Admins why arent you banning whichever mod censored the hell out of rnews or Hey Admins lets change the algorithm for upvotes so places like rthedonald cant game the front page of rall or my personal favorite Hey Admins why havent you implemented a limit on the number of subreddits a user can moderate and done what you can to enforce it deleted Please for the love of God just allow me to block subreddits without the use of third party softwaree  as a community is represented more and more often in the listing the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened Will this have an effect on the hotness over the period of a day or over a longer period Because this would not only prevent theD but also subs like rfunny rgaming and radviceanimals from dominating rall Why dont we just remove upvotesdownvotes from stickies Hey Spez A year ago someone posted a proof of concept on rnetsec about successfully vote brigading using a pretty simple stack See httpsnpredditcomrnetseccommentswlweusedsockpuppetsinrnetseclastyearandare Is there a way we can provide moderators with more transparent data about vote timing frequency account age and other vote health metrics possibly through a moderatoronly API call It seems like since vote brigading is becoming a serious issue on Reddit there should be an effort to increase transparency by providing robust yet anonymized vote health metrics deleted This explains why brand new subreddits flooded the front page I adore the new rall A post from rdndgreentext even made the cut Great work Im on mobile and apologize if this has already been mentioned I wish on rall there was the ability to just block a sub from appearing on the feed without using RES or one of the apps that does it I understand I have total control over what I see on my front page but that doesnt give me any way to see new subs Had I just been able to block rthedonald from appearing on rall I really wouldnt have cared about what a mess it has been the last few weeks Just a thought Thanks for the town hall Is this going to do anything about the problem of submissions in the first  pages  submissions per page being on rall for  hours at a time Or more pages obviously but its most obvious on the first two pages that content does NOT cycle as intended Because when that started happpening people got mad and the admin response was no changes were made to reddits algorithm youre just imagining it And its still happening And still terrible Especially now that we have reddit uploads which arent marked purple by Reddit Enhancement Suite and so we keep accidentally viewing them over and over and oVER AND OVER AND OVER Also I would love to suggest A category tag for subreddits It would be fantastic if I could block or promote specific categories I want rall to show me more gaming content than other content and no sports content and no NSFW female content I would love to be able to do that without having to do thishttpimgurcomaByOMN ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else This undermines Reddit and we are not going to allow it Then theres got to be more fair competition between subreddits as well The rnews debacle was the result of complacency of mods complacency that grew because they simply were the first subs to become default and it never changed I have to ask spez Why did rthedonald hasten this process but other subs like fat people hateyes I know they were banned and sanders for president not hasten this Hey uspez any chance of metrics representing number of posts in rall prior to the change and after the change for major subreddits Its really hard to wrap your head around a change like this in a vacuum particularly when youre given qualitative explantation to a quantitative solution Do you feel that redditors are increasingly quick to jump to conspiracy theory conclusions when any change is made Personally I dont support the views of rthedonald but why not roll out this change when rall was dominated by Bernie Sanders related content It seems a little opportunist and political to put forth these changes now edit I also dont support the views of rSandersForPresident Im not sure why but the replies besides uspez seem to imply allegiance to one candidate or another I just wanted to point out that reddit should look at how this type of issue affects the website throughout its history deleted Just got back from rallrising and everything was either rthedonald or rEnoughTrumpSpam CANT I JUST LOOK FOR PORN IN PEACE PLEASE I never use All I focus on Front to show me what I want Ill give it a try and see if a lot of the sports and politics subs that monopolize the front page at times are marginalized Honestly and I say this as one of the thousands who have been banned from the donald by their idiotic mods Id much rather we have a discussion about the biased agendadriven moderation on your default news sub rnews where the mods have routinely blocked discussion around the TPP for over a year now Why does reddit refuse to do anything about it Im much more concerned with the propagandizing mods of rnews than I am with anything the donald is doing The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of rallour specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing The algorithm change is fairly simpleas a community is represented more and more often in the listing the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened This results in more variety in rall Many people will ask if this is related to rthedonald The short answer is no we have been working on this change for a while but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment Thank you for straightup admitting it That kind of honesty helps build trust between the users and the admins This undermines Reddit and we are not going to allow it And thank you for that as well Ive been having to use my phone to check the site on desktop mode until the App supports filtering with gold just to make rall useable Itll be nice to use it again without having to worry about being drowned out by all the political shenanigans regardless of ones particular flavor of choice in that regards Just looked at rallrising and found that the first  posts were from rthedonald is that a glitch Disappointed you didnt title this Lets all have a town hall about rall yall I really truly and deeply hate the new algorithm changes So what if things I do not agree with get promoted As long as each vote is fair and counted equally this is a good thing When I viewed all I got a snapshot of what people were interested in at a particular point in time Most of these post had large numbers of comments and were usually fairly interesting Now it feels like the posts are more or less appearing randomly I think I get a better selection of ideas from reading google news Every other post is a cat image or some other inconsequential nonsense Say what you will about election posts during an election People upvoting their views is what is supposed to happen When the election is over people will move on This is a good thing Right now reddit feels stale I do not feel my votes count for anything so I have more or less stopped voting I have also more or less stopped reading all because there is  interesting content The thrill of voting to on an article and seeing hit the front page is also gone This site is now boring to me How will this affect the ability of breaking news stories to stay atop the front page Thats a not all together insignificant part of reddits appeal the ability to keep relevant news in the spotlight while things unfold Could you at least add Reddit stickied live threads to rall inb rthedonald starts screaming HES LYING THEYRE SABOTAGING US But seriously thanks for being open about the change  Interestingly enough rthedonald was already getting downvoted out of rall yesterday morning before we made any changes It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough What are your tools for detecting real voting bot voting vote brigading and other vote manipulation If you have these tools are they open source You dropped these    Many people will ask if this is related to rthedonald The short answer is no we have been working on this change for a while but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment We have seen many communities like rthedonald over the yearsones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else This undermines Reddit and we are not going to allow it No its not related but yes it is A couple of mods and I were talking the other day about rredditcom and how it was nice to have a catchall sub like that I know youve talked about the possibility of getting rid of the defaults or mixing them up Are there any plans to bring back rredditcom or making a new version of it Is this like the last time you changed the frontpages and all to not show things you dont want seen Are you gonna backpedal and say you are changing it back while leaving it the same like last time If stickies are only for announcements how about making them so they cant be upvoted That way only people who were intended to see them will How long do the unhot properties last Subs like rspacex would have a flurry of posts that might reach and then nothing until the next launch Would the posts about the next launch still be considered unhot Is there some way to substantiate or dispel the claims that thedonald has been constantly brigaded while reddit admins do nothing  All their posts seem to be getting targeted in the New Im not an American and am tired of the drama this brings to everything but id rather not let people orchestrate what info i consume Right or Left If youre sick of seeing rthedonald posts then create a content filter for it I did this and it was VERY refreshing Suggestion How about implementing RES style keyword filters in rall I have fast machines on fast connections and often I still see subjects that I filtered before RES has a chance to kick in and remove them Finally I can go back to rall again Cant we just have a feature to blacklist subreddits in the same way we can subscribe to them Subscribing makes stuff appear on the front page Could just create a blacklisting feature that removes certain subs we choose not to see I know it may not be your place but I am really concerned with what happened at rnews It seems like it has faded into rMuseumOfReddit already but the mod culture is really concerning as a user The fact that one mod told users to kill themselves and obliterated a thread about a critical event and wasnt dealt with until  hours later and then made a new account to try and reclaim his position is mind blowing Are you ok with reddit being represented by people like that If so why if not why arent things changing Id say this place has bigger problems right now than rthedonald A complete overhaul on mod power and activity should be where youre spending your energy We have seen many communities like rthedonald over the yearsones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else Like when rcirclejerk pretty much had every top post about James Franco By the way do you find it ironic that since rTheDonald came out that rcirclejerk is otherwise rather quiet rconspiracy youre welcome Hi uSpez Why dont we instead have a townhall about the broken moderator structure that has brought great shame on this previouslyfantastic community Far too few individuals weird far too great influence and power on Reddit as was illustrated by the recent behaviour of the rnews Mods which has brought great shame on your organisation Please please fix this NOW It will very soon by too late Kindest regards uPostuk Maybe you guys should also force reddits to not hide the downvote button thedonald hides it with CSS making unrealistic ratios on all posts They are actively abusing the system and its part of how they got so rampant on rall uspez I appreciate the new algorithm but would also like to be able to see things that are trending independent of the negative feedback loop when I want Part of what I enjoy about Reddit is seeing what interesting wave of things is happening recently which usually manifests in rall Hot So this change ruins part of Reddit for me I think the new algorithm is somewhat useful as a smorgasboard view of whats happening on the site but removing the option to see directly what people are voting on without the negative feedback loop is bad The trending subreddits feature is not a substitute for obvious reasons Would it be possible to have both by making a new category alongside Hot New Top etc Maybe something like Current which is basically the old algorithm Also is the new algorithm going to apply to rfront too or just rall Because if you throw this negative feedback loop onto my front page its really going to suck  those are subreddits I want to see more of on purpose deleted Why was there no problem when sanders for president dominated rall Two subreddits that I mod have opted out of rall because the benefits of belonging to it were lower than the benefits of staying out of it The people reading rall dont know our rules dont care about our subreddits culture and are too loweffort to learn before commenting I think rall is really raimlesslybored The reddit wall just got  feet higher I like it But would also like to see a vanilla rall still On desktop and mobile Ive blocked the subs I dont want to see so Ive kind of tailored rall to how I want it to be Theres more than just the donald subreddit that are annoying Ive removed some game communities Sanders politics and things like that too Its a weird balance to have to make Reddit should reboot its Moderation system its too easy for people to hold far too many mod powers with no way to Easily  Quickly boot those people if they are biased or have an agenda Many subreddits are now worse than worthless WorldNews used to be great but subs like it are ruled by party talk and too ripe with brigading and other forms of Censorship Mods should not have the power to censor people unless its a grave issue like doxxing i just come to reddit for links to other places and for the comments but if the comments are sanitized there is no real discussion other than the approved message this is one of the core incompetancies which makes reddit lose most of its value as Socially Aggregated News Media portal Youve let it go on like this for years so its probably pointless to even bother talking about it I would propose that any mod status should  expire after a given time sayone month That way if the person is worth giving that power back to its an Active choice that the community makes not some squatter seniority deleted deleted rallrising remains mostly blank pages followed by more blank pages once thedonald is filtered out Is this something that will be addressed in the future um so when is this rolling out thedonald is still the only posts in rall rising Thats what I check out when I want to see what people are talking about hot is great but its not the latest stuff thedonald is ruining rising Can I opt out of having porn in my rall Mind getting off my friends list so I dont have to read what you post give us the ability to ignore subreddits without reddit gold P Theyre indirectly trying to destroy rblackpeopletwitter Rather than browsing all I would love to have subreddits grouped so I can browse a large set or combination of sets all at once For example if Im into politics I add the politics neighborhood which would include general politics subreddits specific issue subreddits and candidate specific subreddits If Im into games I get specific game subreddits and general gaming subreddits One big benefit is that youll get more exposure to other subreddits that you may not normally see and you wont get totally irrelevant topics to your interests Such as the bazillion porn subreddits This would be a great substitute for all thats between all and regular subscriptions I blocked TheDonald because shitposts should not make up a third of the front page Wouldnt mind seeing only a couple things from there to keep up though Hopefully things will get better deleted  connecting with our fellow humans rtotallynotrobots there needs to be a more formal method of reporting issues with mods an ability to cite sources and examples and a transparency in the investigation Currently when there is a problem you just shitpost about it on another sub or something Then later you get your tinfoil hat when you dont see an enormous and immediate response All I want is for the AMAs to show up in my feed as they are happening instead of only showing up hours later Thank god Any chance of getting an unvoted sort All sorted by hot except those youve voted on So now that the rall algorithm is changed are you going to revert the newly imposed limitations on stickies announcements As you saw from the outcry many subreddits are negativity impacted by those limitations Can we just get rid of defaults entirely Not for nothing but yesterday I noticed a LOT of porn on rall Not saying theres anything bad about that but I was seriously wondering what caused it Was it the kids out of college Lack of good news on the TV I couldnt figure it out Any chance the algorithm increased the porn load by porn I mean any and all naked NSFW stuff Spez This is a little off topic but Ive noticed that there has been a huge shift in rpolitics in the last two days For several months it was basically a giant Hillary Clinton hatefest and I am a supporter and admittedly biased All of a sudden that almost completely disappeared Is anyone on your team investigating what happened Since rpolitics is such a large sub a lot of those posts were in rall Please stop trying to make me use your mobile site with its persistent nagging about the Reddit app I hate that I have to keep enabling Desktop mode to bypass that garbage You mention the web redesign as being the biggest project in  As Im sure youre aware almost every site that goes through any kind of redesign also goes through a long period of everyone complaining that they just want the old site back My question would be what plans do you have in place to ensure that the redesign is something that the overwhelming majority of users are actually satisfied with The only request I want to make is to please add a dark mode into the new upcoming layout natively without needing RES or any addon Love dark mode on the app would love to have it on desktop as well If you do it Ill totally add a trophy to your profile I dont know how but I will think of something Other than that keep up the great work Hi Spez Im a clinical psychologist and for the past six years Ive been the mod of a subreddit for people with borderline personality disorder rBPD BPD has among the highest rates of completed suicide of any psychiatric disorder approximately  of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point Given this out of our  subscribers we are likely to be having dozens of users attempting suicide every week In particular the users who are most active on our sub are often very symptomatic and desperate and we very frequently get posts from actively suicidal users Im telling you this because over the years I have felt very unsupported by the Reddit admins in one particular area As you know there are unfortunately a lot of very disturbed people on Reddit Some of these people want to hurt others As a result I often encounter users who goad on our suicidal community members to kill themselves This is a big problem Of course encouraging any suicidal person to kill themselves is a big deal but people with BPD in particular are prone to impulsivity and are highly susceptible to abusive behavior This makes them more likely to act on these malicious suggestions When I encounter these users I immediately contact the admins Although I can ban them and remove their posts I cannot stop them from sending PMs and creating new accounts to continue encouraging suicide Instead I need you guys to step in and take more direct action The problem Im having is that it sometimes take more than  full days before anything is done by the admins In the meantime I see the offending users continue to be active on Reddit and sometimes continuing to encourage suicide Over the years Ive asked you guys how we can ensure that these situations are dealt with immediately or at least more promptly than  days later and Ive gotten nothing As a psychologist who works primarily with personality disordered and suicidal patients I can assure you that someone is going to attempt suicide because of a situation like this if it hasnt happened already We both myself and Reddit need to figure out a better way to handle this Please tell me what we can do Im very eager to work with you guys on this Thank you Edit Thanks for the support everyone Im hopeful that uspez will address this Edit  More than a month has passed and I havent heard back from uspez I heard from another admin who was very kind and eager to help but ultimately they could not come up with a solution and told me that their hands are tied On Sunday  yet another person told one of our users to kill themselves As of Wednesday   hours have passed since I first contacted the admins about this and I have still not heard back Im really at a loss here I fear that it will take a publicized suicide for anything to change and perhaps not even then Does anyone have any ideas on how to get Reddit to actually do something about this Edit   It happened again this weekend and I didnt get a response for  hours The user had not only told people on rBPD and other subs to kill themselves but had also encouraged a mentally unstable person to commit murder Two full days and the person kept posting Here is the final word that I got from Spez What you should do report the user then ban them from your community Well always be working to speed our response times but you have some agency here as well Thats it That is the answer to this post Just a bit of feedback the new user profile pages are hard to CTRLF through for specific comments or posts Perhaps there could be some sort of toggle on the viewers side to not view the context of each comment even without changing the rest of the pages appearance I know devs hate undoing work they did so this could work as a compromise between the new version and completely reverting to the old version Truly I dont know whats more amazing how far Reddit has come in the past year or the fact that we still dont have a decent search function I just want the option of seeing only legacy profiles The new ones are so clunky and ugly Can the web version in mobile fuck off with reverting back from desktop view every time I visit the page Used to be I requested desktop once on a new device and I was good to go Now I get an ad and a mobile layout every time I load the front page Why do tech companies have to fix what isnt broken So with Facebook and Google stepping up its antibot defense do you see Reddit going in that same direction Or are we going to just keep ignoring the elephant in the room If people are able to manipulate the top stories by paying for Fake accounts that spamupvote whats next What are the Reddit team doing to address the massive number of bots being used to spread misinformation and to blanket upvotedownvote Will mods ever be getting tools to help combat the surge of sockpuppet accounts that appear on the site daily Also what happened to antibrigading tools that were talked about a long time ago Whats this antievil team about Are there jackets If so how do I join Can you please get rid of power moderators Theres zero reason any one person should moderate  subs This just gives them the ability to ban users from multiple popular subs just because they feel like it rather than because of any issue across all the subs Its ludicrous Put a rule in place that limits the number of subs a single person can moderate to  then also add a rule that says the total number of major subs a single person can moderate cant exceed  Stop giving power to random fucking losers who wish they had real authority in life  were especially pleased to see features like native video on our front pages every day Is this vreddit content Its terrible More often than not these videos just freeze on me Why host videos anyway Im particularly proud of how far our Community Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams have come Weve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive which means that much more often were catching issues before they become issues Id like to highlight one stat in particular at the beginning of  our TS work was almost entirely driven by user reports Today more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods This is a lot of words but I dont know what they mean Are you talking about spam brigades doxxing bots or what I really dislike the new profile system and want a way to ignore it completely looking at peoples profile page has been made significantly worse and you should be able to opt out of having to see all these reddit power users As a user of the iOS app I cant help but be irked by one part of the subreddit search function When typing in a subreddit on the app it is common to find random basically unpopulated subreddits to pop up as suggested fill in terms As someone who rarely subscribes to subreddits I use the search function often and get annoyed when I go to a  subscriber sports team reddit rather than their K or so and active counterpart often because I dont know the official term  spelling of the Team sub My proposed solution to this issue is to change the suggested sub pop ups to be ranked on subscriber count as long as the first letters match up and the typed in query does not complete the title of another subreddit This would solve my biggest gripe with the app in its current form Thank you for keeping this website rolling It must be hard doing a thankless and hate filled job like this and although I do not agree with all of your decisions I know you are trying to run this site most effectively Imo there is no reason to have profiles and chat Theres already Facebook for that Your last Are you hinting at something uspez I dont follow the admin team much but I am very thankful for what you guys do Hope things go well for ya mate deleted deleted Of all the subreddits you moderate which one would you say is your favorite and why is it rHighQualityGifs deleted Spez reddit appears to be putting massive amounts of efforts into frontfacing overhaul and seems to be halfassedly to a detrimental level tweaking modmail and modqueue tools Were it not for thirdparty tools Toolbox for Reddit and Layer large subreddits would be absolutely impossible to moderate effectively Why are incredibly basic functions like modmail or inbox search being put far behind petty features like bulk mod actionshttpsiredditmdidltnwzgif which will always take more clicks than just removing on an itemlevel basis user chat and video hosting Why is my personal inbox filled with ban messages for my subreddit to the point where its impossible to look through Neverending reddit fries itself  of the time on any of my browsers so ten pages in and Im toast These kind of halfimplementations feel like fields full of software debris that make reddit a bitch to interact with Perhaps community management has moved to be more proactive but the results of that arent really being felt on any of my larger teams On the other hand complete communication drop offs have become pretty common and the community managers no longer seem to be available for requests for help or advice This was not true last year Its pretty disappointing since community communication had significantly improved in the recent past Have you considered your role in the spread of misinformation and radicalization that has taken place over the past year Other tech companies have taken steps to become more transparent and identify accounts that are using the platform in bad faith to promote false ideas and influence the public discourse What is reddit doing Edit fat fingers What are your thoughts on users being banned from subs for being members in other subs What does that look like when it comes to circumvention I have multiple accounts on one account I have the most Karama from a sub Ive been banned by on another account for participating in a sub Do I get a site ban for circumventing the ban by using my high Karna account or should I stop participating there and accept the loss of access to a default sub And what about being banned for arguing on a sub both parties equally guilty in verbal jousting but because a mod doesnt like where Im coming from bans me and doesnt touch the other guy when both of us were equally ramping up the sarcasm and creative insults How can I respect such a platform The biggest issue on Reddit is the complete lack of accountability of mods These unpaid laborers almost inevitably become tyrants Reddit desperately needs a mechanism for removing mods via subreddit members I can understand why Reddit wants to stay on their good side I mean they have held your entire site hostage on several occasions but their unchecked power remains an issue on every platform that depends on them Pretending to work on improving reddit while ignoring the real problems with the site in favor of the awful app the awful redesign or any of the other terrible development you are doing is laughable Will multireddit support on mobile be on the radar this year We rarely get things right the first time profile pages anybody Then I guess its just too bad for us that were still being forced into them deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk How do we address certain users on the site abusing their administrator privileges There are some users that adhere very strictly to the rules of their subreddits and since they can sometimes moderate tens even hundreds of subreddits they can ban you from any and all subreddit that they moderate Do we just continue on as business as usual while this small number of people make a very large impact on the site as a whole Here is one example of what I am talking about httpsrateredditorscomrandoh Im particularly proud of how far our Community Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams have come Really seriously Im not There are calls to violence racism harassment doxxing all the time here Nothing happens people dont get perma banned communities dont get banned and they can still run around this site pulling this bullshit and forcing good users off the site In  well continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming Youre banning abusive and racist communites that encourage harassment Do you guys have any interesting plans to unite the community this year I really enjoyed Robin from  years ago and would like to see it return  For anyone else that hates the new profile RES has a setting to default to the legacy version I actually need the legacy to be able to moderate properly RES SettinghttpswwwredditcomrEnhancementwikiprofileswikiredirecttolegacyoverview Im really happy about the Reddit android app It used to not even be able to show the message box  Good job team A subreddit exists which has consistently broken every sitewide rule there is which routinely doxxes witchhunts and posts calls for violence in real life Your current way of dealing with them has consisted of the message that These people feel unheard and need a place to express themselves in This is unacceptable As long as you allow these people to continue you are chasing away good users and filtering reddit towards greater toxicity Im particularly proud of how far our Community Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams have come Weve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive which means that much more often were catching issues before they become issues Id like to highlight one stat in particular at the beginning of  our TS work was almost entirely driven by user reports Today more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods This is good progress but I still think youre a bit too lenient on who is and isnt allowed to run a sub on this site Are you really okay with having self admitted neonazis running  subscriber subreddits filled with neonazi imagery Im ofc talking about runcensorednews which currently features the Nordic Resistance MovementhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNordicResistanceMovements logo in their banner  couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an artistic masterpiece Im looking forward to what you do for April Fools this year because that was pretty fun Im proud of how far our Community Trust  Safety and AntiEvil teams have come Those were a thing Profiles are cancer Restore legacy overview Hey uSpez I saw you in this super interesting article about Doomsday Prep for the Super Richhttpswwwnewyorkercommagazinedoomsdayprepforthesuperrich Can you tell us about your survival bunker Also when I first started learning to program through Udacity you taught me the basics of creating a comment system thanks yo Why isnt Thedonald And all affiliated subs banned for breaking almost every sitewide rule you have yet edit Read this comment by uillpaco  Here is a very complete list of violations by thedonald of Reddits policy This was sent directly to to uspez a while ago  httpsnpredditcomrannouncementscommentsabjotimeformyquarterlyinquisitionredditceoheredpyoua  This is not about censoring people with opposing views Dont buy into that false narrative This is about applying the rules equally across the board For whatever reason thedonald is treated with a different standard than other subs and people are fully aware of it The only ones turning a blind eye to these blatant violations are the admins themselves I dont want to download your app At various times the mobile website seems to introduce more annoying delay features to force me go get the app First you had the reddit icon slowly fill with color with instructions to download the app whereas before a post would instantly load Now it looks like you delay the comments from appearing again replaced with a delay causing message telling me to download the app I dont want your app Can you please stop these unnecessary delays Dear Spez White supremacists are now nearuniversally radicalized online and by allowing various white supremacist and altright subreddits to continue to exist and recruit vulnerable men on this website you are enabling terrorism and supporting extremists Other major tech companies are taking action against white supremacists and removing them from their services including Twitter Uber Spotify Cloudflare Google GoDaddy PayPal ApplePay Discord AirBNB Mastercard and Patreon Meanwhile you and the reddit admins are silent Redditors on TD were responsible for

communities have just been banned though they are ignoring the larger ones httpswwwredditcomrfullfascism  banned httpswwwredditcomrwhiterights  banned httpswwwredditcomrBlackCrimesMatter  banned This appeasement by doing to absolute bare minimum will not make any difference as they still have a multitude of other subreddits to go to and will just make many more Unless an actual policy change is made this is meaningless It seems like Reddit is the only large social media company to escape media scrutiny when it comes to political and statesponsored manipulation campaigns Do you have any details you can share about ifhow Reddit was targeted during the  election What are your plans for the future as the site grows and Reddit becomes a bigger target for political and statesponsored campaigns Can we have a talk about mod abuse in general Not being able to participate in a politically or ideologically focused sub without having to prove your allegiance to the subs theme on the threat of being instantly permabanned doesnt really fit in with the intended inclusive nature of this site For instance I had the location wrong in a comment I wrote in response to a video of a massive homeless community and was banned from rlatestagecapitalism within the hour When I asked what the deal was they asked what my political leanings were I expressed that I was not a capitalist but cant see why that would be relevant in context with my comment and they then told me I wasnt garnering sympathy with them by questioning there methods and was subsequently muted by the mod How is that not plain old abuse of power I ran into this recently Can you please add a feature for mods that if a stickied post is removed it is also unstickied We had a bit of a mishap where this happened and we couldnt figure out why we couldnt sticky a second post on the sub for a while When are subs that evidently disregard the rules will be banned uspez Whats being done to curb the influx of companypolitically botted posts Are there going to be any changes involving how the default subs work or their mod structure im just here to sort by controversial deleted  and posttoprofile to chat now in beta for individuals and groups Which you wont let us opt out of no matter how much we might want to be rid of these incredibly stupid and pointless features  In  well continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming by making it harder to read for everyone  Well be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon None of whom will be allowed to optout of course We appreciate the work Thank you cheers Why could it be your last Why would it be your last Please please add more options for the time range for sorting by top  hour to  hours is absurd a hr and hr range would be much more useful and relevant in how the news cycle works We will continue to support our free public api Please keep to this dont pull a Twitter on us  Also Ive seen quite a few people say the Android version crashes on x just so you know though chances are you have analytics for this already  I hope The link in this OP didnt work for me on mobile even putting it in the browser And when I finally got it I cant run it Crashes immediately I sent in a report For the lazy Android users httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomredditfrontpage Edit For those wondering I had found it on Reddits twitter An app announced on Facebook seemingly invisible on Play Store was eventually found through a bitly link on Twitter Edit  Fixed Over in the rAndroid thread I noticed that enabling the night mode restarts the app and makes you lose your place Are there any plans to fix this issue In addition the lack of an AMOLED compatible night mode is fairly annoying Being able to completely turn off the background pixels saves a substantial amount of battery life and provides a more comfortable viewing experience for many people Also are you guys using the new Night Mode Libraryhttpandroiddevelopersblogspotcaandroidsupportlibraryhtml If not it could make things a bit easier for you guys Regarding the iOS app PROS  UI is great looking  Strong focus on content images

really need blue and purple links please How am I supposed to know what I already know if Reddit wont let me know what I learned today Hi why is the Android app not available for people outside the US Will you close down or restrict APIs for third party developers of reddit clients like Twitter did Since youve been on reddit as long as I have then you know that part of reddit culture is open source Ive seen a disturbing trend away from that Im not even sure the reddit of today would be open source which is what worries me and what Im not seeing here either What are your plans to open source Its in the reddit culture and tradition Is everyone making too much money now Part of the reason reddit is so popular with such a loyal userbase is because it open sourced its tools Its gotten so bad that when someone simply asks about source code without moralizing they are downvoted and mocked Without the source code we dont know what these apps are doing what data they are collecting what information youre storing and discarding and worst of all there is no guarantee of security I sincerely hope you havent completely turned your backs on the very users who created Rich Ass Reddit

seems like too much Typographic Hierarchy httpiimgurcomPjXDNrtpng The subreddits and dates here are huge  Long Site URLs httpiimgurcomBznKFLpng Long URLs get chopped in a really awkwardlooking way  Personal User Page httpiimgurcomNJMlxVSpng reddit age doesnt show me anything The gear for Settings also doesnt do anything for me Night Theme httpiimgurcomSIBNUdApng An additional option for AMOLED dark with pure black backgrounds would be great httpiimgurcomiCZSCIpng My username is impossible to read in night mode and that blue is awfully bright Switching Accounts httpiimgurcomQoqoJLpng Too many taps Settings Switch Account choose the account I like how this is implemented in other apps like Now for Reddit where I can just tap a username in the side menu I switch accounts a LOT and this would get annoying  Text Posts httpiimgurcomIdzsbpng That big band of color is still so bright in night mode and doesnt go away even when you scroll Thats a lot of visual real estate for something so huge and bold I often reread a post before replying and didnt like the disappearing game with the comment button it only shows up once you reach the bottom I understand why but readers dont always progress linearly down a page General Comment Entry Please please please give us a way to preview comments so we can check if our Markdown is busted A small row of buttons perhaps optionally displayed for Markdown options like links would be great Sure I can do that on my keyboard but some symbols arent as accessible and the buttons would be easierfaster Navigating to my own Submissions After I submitted a comment I wanted to make sure my Markdown wasnt busted so I expected to be brought directly to my comment Nope just saw the original post and the other comments on the page I tried to tap on the comment from my profile and was brought to the entire thread again I actually had to switch apps in order to edit this Sloppy and not usable Overall Theres promise but Im inclined to stick with other apps for now When will or will there ever be multi Reddit support for iOS and Android This is the only feature holding me back from using these full time If multi reedit support is coming its really important to sort easily or even save the sort preference I always use new but Im sure others may be different I prefer browsing rall over my front page since I feel like otherwise I miss out on great content from subreddits I dont subscribe to like that fascinating post about the landlocked neighborhttpswwwredditcomrlegaladvicecommentsdciupdatemyneighborscausedthemselvestobe  and thus being able to filter out subreddits is crucial Also I prefer sorting by new on all of my favorite subreddits and you cant seem to change the default view for this Otherwise it looks really nice but thats about it in terms of pros Im gonna stick to Sync for Reddit for now The messages section needs a lot of work Why is there no typographic distinction between headings and body content Why is it truncated at one line Why does it not show me the post title the comment is from or subreddit Just seems sloppy to me Reddit App httpiimgurcomhnpMZkpng Sync For Reddit httpiimgurcomQGAnupng Looked at the iOS app and I agree with others that the UI is pretty and I like some of the features However I really wish there were more advanced settings so that I could tailor the app to the way I like it For example I want to be able to change the way images load or how things look in general That is why I liked alien blue so much It let me change it to my preferences Also Id love to be able to only see about  posts at a time and swipe to hide all of those posts and see a new  Just like how alien blue pro did it That way I always see fresh content and I dont have to worry about being  posts deep and accidentally scrolling all the way to the top Will this one have the same neglect weve come to know and love with Alien Blue Edit most recent comments dont show up via messages tab never mind just confusingly labelled Edit  wait no easy imgur uploads in comments Boo Why havent you released the source code under a free license Granted Im still on Note  version  but the app crashes on open Unfortunately Reddit has stopped This comment likely wont get up there too much but Ill update to Marshmallow in the next little while and see if that solves it Ill report back EDIT FOLLOWING UP Sorry my update left me in boot hang If anyone can or wants to help with that  Im on Note  nW  Canada  with  TWRP recovery installing the Darklord  S Rom GFXXUAPC It also left me with hang installing the Note  RC Darklord rom afterwards Restoring my TWRP backup was successful It installs fine and just holds forever at boot animation yes I know it can take a while Im reading that flashing CWM might work but would like to chat to someone who can say for sure so I dont have to guinea pig my only phone Hi have you guys considered using the Windows Bridge for IOS to bring the app to Windows Phone why should i use your android app instead of something like reddit is fun baconreader reddit news reddit sync etc what do you bring to the table that they dont youre going to have to do some pretty fancy tricks to get me to move away from paid RIF edit no mod functions im out let me know when it gets updated UI is pretty i already turned disabled the big image previews because it takes up too much room compact has thumbnails not sure why you have the upvotes displayed on the right even though its on the left for  of reddits pages i like how it shows the users here and subscribers at the top of a subreddit when i click on a user name it takes me to either posts or comments why cant i get an overview the user page only shows one type of karma weird do you have the ability to change image settings based on whether or not youre on wifi that would be nice the image submission feature is nice  especially how it shows recent communities that ive posted to but i want to be able to navigate in my own library click on the share icon and be able to choose your app instead of having to do it all through your app dunno if thats a big deal or just habit for me my image submission is uploading slowlypoorly is there a file size limit its been submitting for awhile now alright i tried to upload an image through your app and it took forever so i cancelled Sometimes imgur hates when i upload superbig images and im usually too lazy to make them smaller I cropped and make it a smaller file just for the hell of it which  of the time makes imgur happy aaaaaaaaand im still waiting for it to submit dunno what to say about that ill just let it sit here and try to submit for awhile i guess not sure how i feel about the various fonts mixing it up in my account history section also personally not a huge fan of it being autoabbreviated I get it but its just a bit weird for me itll be a BIG deal to a lot of people that they cant see their vote counts here i kinda like when im browsing my front page and i click on an external link that it takes me to the reddit comment section with a preview of the content above  or maybe i want to complain about being required to make an extra click to see the full content hmmmmm I will say that it doesnt ALWAYS give an image preview so there are instances where youre kinda forcing me to click on the content twice to see it i like the comment reply dialog where it shows the original comment at the top and i have a lot of white space at the bottom to work with Oh but when i do that i cant select the above text to copypaste I also dont have the option to quote the text above I guess i could precopy the text before i reply then click reply then paste it two serious nickpicky things with my inbox first its messages and not actually my default inbox thats going to be kinda confusing to a lot of people I moderate places and messages threads all of that stuff in a very weird fashion in there I get direct messages modmail etc all bundled together in a notfun way I want to see my direct messages modmail is REALLY weird nevermind its lack of functionality i cant really see whats even going on It doesnt open the full modmail or even the full message When a user is banned i cant even see who the message is going to I know your goal isnt to babysit the moderators around here but it seems to lack basic functionality of being able to read messages at all okay sorry i think im done for awhile didnt mean to edit it  times but i did anywayhttpiimgurcomNFGiSBjpg Theres a lot of stuff I like about it and look forward to its evolution Will there be a way of removing the images that show up in compact view I like to browse by titles which also leaves room for more links on my screen Will there be an iPad version of the Reddit app I and I think many of the mobileRedditbrowsing community will be sticking with other clients for the moment This is a nice proofofconcept so far but its near the bottom of the heap in terms of user experience compared to plenty other apps which by the way tend not to be monetised by way of intrusive advertisement Theres loads of great commentary and feedback on this thread alone but because the app was released hours before the official announcement discussion about the app has been scattered to the four winds and itll be difficult finding a plurality of early adopter feedback I use and until Reddits official app is improved will probably continue to use Alien Blue on iOS Over on rAlienBlue there are plenty of users dedicating time to outlining current problems oversights and confusing design choices Here are a couple  uCaptainAlaska put together a list of issueshttpswwwredditcomrAlienBluecommentsdqxredditforiosisoutdtbll that become apparent when comparing Reddits app to Alien Blue  The unofficial discussion threadhttpswwwredditcomrAlienBluecommentsdqajknewredditappdiscussionthread has covered plenty of what seem to be weird design choices measuring pros eg the UI and smooth performance against cons eg that obnoxious omnipresent bright orange button People are also taking up the feedback banner on rredditmobile which might be the official subreddit but also might not Overall at the moment I think early adopters are confused as to why great alwaysuseful features that have been present in apps like Alien Blue which remember was the official Reddit app for a little bit forever are missing from the Reddit mobile app Users were expecting improvement on  or at least parity with  something like Alien Blue and that just isnt what we have at the minute To reiterate I think the current app at least on iOS is a good proof of concept It looks nice performs well and comes with the healthy incentive of free Reddit gold whether or not this is just to delay the inevitable glut of complaints about intrusive inline ads Its just unfortunate that for the moment the app isnt quite as good as the alternatives Edit Id like to point out that uggAlex is being super constructive right now check out his ongoing reply to unutshttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsdqxgtredditmobileappsdthcgd and that I hope the rest of the Reddit team take his example of frank open communication with the central audience for their official app deleted Id like to try the app but when I try to launch it I get Unfortunately Reddit has stopped Galaxy S running Cyanogenmod  Android  I can provide further information if required and I am available for troubleshooting Message notifications please When I was using Baconit for Windows Phone I always got notifications When I switched to iPhone ABs notifications barely worked and now the official app has none at all Also please work on bringing this to Windows  Mobile People will appreciate that a lot Just downloaded it I currently use alien blue and heres what I think the official app needs Im on iphone  a more compact way to show posts I know theres a setting for this but I would like it even smaller a way to tell I already viewed a post Grey it out or something I dont see a way to do that  comments and counting Not sure if this will ever be seen but Im going to throw it out there anyways As I think the many other comments have pointed out the official reddit app has a long way to go in order to catch up with the features options functionality customization etc as the many other thirdparty reddit apps out there already offer I know youve already stated that you care about staying committed to reddits free API That makes me happy to hear However one thing I really really really dont want to see is the old Microsoft EEE move  Embrace We now have an official reddit client app  Extend Add reddit features and functionality to the official reddit app that cant be used or accessed through the public API  Extinguish Now because of all of the exclusive features and functionality that only the official reddit app can offer basically force users to use the official one I think its great that reddit has moved to offer its own official reddit clientmdashthat has longbeen a huge demographic of potential revenue that reddit had left virtually untappedmdashbut please do not exploit any shady techniques of forcing adoption of your appmdashand only your appmdashto do this I want to think reddit is classier than this but I just felt it was worth saying it just in case  tldr dont start adding reddit features and functionality to the official app that arent supported or accessible through the public API in order to force users to use the official app for those features because nobody else can offer them Here is the APK for any nonUS redditors httpsdrivegooglecomfiledBwduKCPXjxWXYelNYkRpdDAview You got  months of gold if you login Thank you for using the Reddit mobile app As a thank you for logging in during launch week youve been gifted  months of Reddit Gold I love the casual subreddits idea from alien blue is that feature going to be in the new app Are there plans for a Windows mobile app Can someone let me know once these basic Alien Blue features are available or where theyre hidden  Hide Posts both singular and allread  Compact View not that halfcompact that exists today  Minimal click videogif plays why does it take FOUR pages to see a gif actually move  Quick access to manually entered subreddits We all appreciate the effort in getting this live but why not wait  weeks and implement some of these rudimentary features first Whats the rush Will mod tools be coming into Reddit for iOS What makes this better than Reddit is Fun deleted Windows phone please Its great that youve put these out either way Hope to check them out sometime deleted First of all as an AB user thank you for the gold and Im sure you guys have been working hard on this That being said you guys are missing some stuff  no way to easily hide posts from the feed  no content filter  no way to view votes from comment page  no way to get to all comments from viewing individual comment  seems like notifications doesnt highlight what youre getting as a notification  seems like I have to refresh to see my newest comments on the comments page I hope these are things you guys plan on adding Will Push Notifications be added in iOS Will there be D Touch support for devices capable Please make quick actions custom subreddits Will there be options to move the voting arrows to the left  Which is how it is on the normal site Edit Also Triple tap for dark theme andor changing of theme based on time You are looking at the lake The app is not available in Germany I find that quite frustrating since most of us and myself dont really need a localized version All the good content is in English anyway I know Im in the minority here but could we please get a better moble app for windows phone Baconit sucks Will you guys consider making a UWP app for those of us on windows phone Id love to be able to use an official reddit app I need the ability to switch between modmails for different subs otherwise askreddit just dominates Could there be a feature so that mod teams can use canned macro responses to frequent problems If there could be mod mode just in general that would be great share to slack flair users flair posts add contributor remove comment  post approve comment  post ban user timed or perma etc It is very pretty and very fast Was the iOS app built in swift So I just installed the Reddit for Android app and its crashing on startup never even reaches the homepage screenshothttpimgurcomWLWheed Ive tried rebooting my phone same problem Im using a Moto E Tracfone running Android  EDIT After the update it seems to be working Getting  months of free Reddit Gold for downloading the app seems to mean that for the first  months well have an adfree experience Then what How will ads be incorporated into the app experience Feels a little like a bait and switch Moto Droid MAXXXT  Unfortunately Reddit has stopped Immediately after launching Downvoted for reporting a bug in an app launch thread Gold Nice looking app Ive been using the longneglected Flow on Android but Im not sure if Ill switch Some things I noticed  The back arrow in the upper left is nonfunctional for me  The contents section does not remember which comments I collapsed in previous visits  No formatting help in the comment dialog I can never remember the formatting tricks EDIT I forgot line breaks the first time I wrote this a preview would have helped  Acknowledgments section is barren Im surprised that not one open source project is mentioned whether by licensing requirement or just respect  I cant figure out how to get to my past comments I can see the list but when I click on one I am taken to the top level thread Because of this I am editing this comment from my old app  deleted Its very pretty and and well designed but there are some issues and its very bare bones right now Id like the ability to open the profile of whoever made a post or comment go to the subreddit something is posted in open imgur images and YouTube videos inapp with their APIs And most importantly pay to get rid of ads with actual money not Reddit gold Until some of these things are present Ill stick with the much more complete and pleasant to use Sync Play Store says its incompatible with my device Can you fix it or upload the APK Itd be awesome if at some point they would support at least some kind of subreddit flair at the moment you cant see anything at least in Alien Blue some flair shows up Why the hell is there a country lock I cant install the Android app from the Netherlands On Android the back button in the topleft doesnt work from the comments page I have to use the system back button to get back to the posts page Besides that its a very clean looking app Im gonna stick with this for a couple weeks Using a OnePlus X on Oxygen OS X based on Android  Edit In night mode the post button doesnt show in the comment submission page Also the comment sort settings dont seem to work deleted No love for Ireland We speak English too yknow Unfortunately reddit has stopped Great job with the app Looks really nice especially the subreddit headers Pulling your canary then finally making your own reddit app Thats a bold strategy Cotton This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this useraposs privacy If you would like to do the same add the browser extension GreaseMonkeyhttpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddongreasemonkey to Firefox and add this open source scripthttpsgreasyforkorgenscriptsredditoverwrite Then simply click on your username on Reddit go to the comments tab and hit the new OVERWRITE button at the top Not available in my country What the hell Im digging the new app The only thing that Ive grown to love from Now For Reddit App is the colour coded coded strip to the left of the comments to be able to easily tell which responses come after what Its not a big deal but it does help when some threads become so huge And doesnt take up too much room so later comments dont look to squashed But good work Thanks Mine crashes upon opening every single time Ive restarted my tablet uninstalledreinstalled but nothing changes Any ideas what can be done to fix this I really want to use the new app Still no force touch uses Damn I was really hoping to have a use for that After using it for a couple minutes Im going back to AlienBlue I really liked the UI for iOS but why there is no force touch support It was my favorite on alien blue i was able to browse reddit just with force touch Also I miss collapsing comments with swipes  This app is just like a pretty face i hope you will be adding this features soon deleted The Android link doesnt work for me Verizon Samsung Galaxy S Android  Force close upon attempting to open the app Cant even try it out Im on android  I cant even launch it it just insta crashes  APKhttpwwwapkmirrorcomapkredditincredditredditreleaseredditandroidapkdownload if anyone who live outside the US CAN AU and UK is interested Things I like  Night mode Thank you This is much easier on the eyes  Subreddit selection card uses the individual subs snoos Thats fantastic  Free gold Im not above accepting a bribe  Defaulting to my front page instead of to rall is much much appreciated  Ooo imgur integration Fancy Things I dont like  Inbox doesnt default to the same unread replies that the browser does Thats confusing  Some views have a settings gear and Settings in the context menu that go to the same place Thats silly  Its not immediately obvious that tapping the apps logo will bring out the subreddit selection card You might want to consider an app tutorial the little dialog boxes that pop up for when an app is first used that highlight nonobvious features like that  Newold reply highlighting in the inbox is not at all sufficient Consider giving unread replies a different background color like RES does on desktop  Viewing unread messages and comment replies on the app doesnt appear to mark them as read on desktop Viewing unread messages on the app doesnt appear to mark them as read on the app either comment replies seem to be working fine Viewing them on desktop does mark them as read in the app though  Wait a minute Does this app not support screen rotation What sort of madness is that  There seems to be an intermittent bug with the apps back arrow in the upperleft not working The phones back button always seems to work fine though Id think you could just ditch the inapp back arrow but there may be weird phone configurations that make that unworkable I dunno Edit Also are you going to make this open source Thatd be pretty sweet Edit I suppose I should note that Im on Android since I mentioned a bug or two Amazing efforts and giving away  months of gold for people logging in this week is just incredible Getting my first taste of gold right now thank you  What I have noticed that is lacking or broken on the Android app Tested on Galaxy Note  running   Scrolling can hang and be clunky sometimes in card view  When in compact view I cant directly open the picture by tapping on it It goes to comments  wasted tap  Only provides a simple comment writing system  no live preview no buttons for bold italics superscript bullets tables etc Something that every Reddit app needs  looking at you Reddit is Fun Another app for examplehttpiimgurcompItCUpng  Poor color choices in subreddit sidebar when in night mode ScreenshothttpiimgurcomMGYLpng  Certain subreddits top bar colors dont work well with the iconstext ScreenshothttpiimgurcomkxNaapng  App crashes when opening a subreddit Wiki link  looks like there is no wiki support It should at least open it in an internal browser but wiki support would be good in the official app ScreenshothttpiimgurcomeWVgdORpng  Imgur links are overwhelmingly opening in the browser  no imgur support ScreenshothttpiimgurcomJbjBOpng  Name of poster not visible without opening post  Bothers me that voting arrows are sidebyside rather than stacked vertically Not terribly important but felt worth mentioning Reddit is Fun GP for referencehttpiimgurcomHzVvnpng  When in light mode posts look like thishttpiimgurcomtAjdgRVjpg When in night mode posts look like thishttpiimgurcomkKYiMSjpg Notice how light mode has a different color for the title than the information whereas all text is the same color in night mode The difference in contrast is important and night mode should have something similar  No AMOLED mode primarily black rather than gray  Community information could be a slide from the right of screen to open an actual side bar  When in certain subreddits the color of the top nav bar can be very distracting especially considering it is always visible as shown in this screenshothttpiimgurcomSqmLsnpng Perhaps an option to hide it when scrolling down  While on the frontpageall if you want to jump to a posts subreddit you need to tap on the tiny little text on the post that tells what the subreddit is A combination of large fingers and smaller screens could make this difficult I would add an additional Jump to subreddit option in the context menu  vertical dots on each post  If gold is the only way to remove adds then that is garbage I will gladly pay a couple bucks to remove them but not monthly That is how you ensure nobody uses the app Giving people  months of gold means we now have no idea how intrusive they may or may not be for three months This is not how you convince people to switch or buy reddit gold See edit at bottom of comment  Edit Some subs have images you can imbed in comments called comment faces on ranime for example some are even animated These never show up in any app which is fine because its non essential but it would really set the app apart Just a few suggestions Ive found  keep up the good work Edit I was alerted that you can test ads by logging out Ive noticed some sponsored posts being injected between them occasionally throughout reddit Very nonintrusive if thats all it is I stand by my point however that paying monthly for gold shouldnt be the only way to get adfree and I still favor the traditional proadfree  upfront payment model Very pretty I like it so far Two things It takes two taps to minimize a comment chain Silly I want to filter from rall specifically wTheDonald and I dont see how to do that Im on Android  and the back button on the top left corner doesnt work I have to use my phones back button instead Its strange that the mobile Reddit app doesnt have published source code unlike the Reddit platform itself Are there any plans to change that in the near future  months of free gold for using the app on launch week  Im running a Samsung Note  on Android  The site tells me my device is not compatible Whats the problem there Ill give it a shot but its going to have to be pretty special to oust Relay Hi Guys Im hyped for the new app and am glad youve decided to take it in your own direction just thought Id share some first impression thoughts Pros Beautiful UI really looks smart and fits the iOS feel really well I love the card view and being able to view all nearly of the content on the front page which is a big deal for me Cons Gifs are displayed with a play symbol over them on the card view which leads me to think that they would play right there on the page or at least open up iOS video viewer like they do on Alien Blue but instead it reloads the imgur link and just takes me to imgur There should be a way imo to let users play gifs on the card view directly it saves a lot of time and is really the reason I dont think Ill be transitioning from AB right away Congratulations again on your App launch reddit Have you considered making this opensource There are a lot of coders on reddit and Im sure some of them would be happy to help you out What about a search bar for you saved folder Its so difficult scrolling through it all trying to find links from the past Using Nexus  with Android  I cant find the app directly in the app store When I open the link you provided on my computer and try to Install I get error This app is incompatible with all of your devices When I open the link you provided on my phone in Chrome it doesnt load Play store just opens the page in the browser and when I try to install it I get the same error Looks a bit like Facebook with different colors  I dont like how the image preview takes up either full screen or not at all I want little thumbnails They allow me to make a quick decision without taking up all the space What does the apps stack look like Both iOS and Android Id love to know more about the apps design and code architecturepattern decisions I was just about to install the application Reddit The Official App on Android and its prompted me asking for permission to Identity and PhotosMediaFiles Could you elaborate what it needs these for Reddit is fun needs no permissions so Id like to understand what you need them for EDIT Just realised I was only upgrading reddit is fun I did a new install and found it needs the same permissions The compact mode doesnt seem to be terribly compact on iOS I really would like to be able to see more than a handful of headlines on the screen at a time Also its very annoying to use sports subreddits without being able to see flair  I assume displaying flair is coming Unless Im missing something it doesnt like you can switch accounts without navigating away from the post youre currently reading I liked how easy it was to switch accounts on alien blue Will this app see a release on the Amazon appstore Im a Blackberry  user which has a great sandbox android environment within BBOS but I can imagine other people using nongoogle android devices might also want to see this app as well After all I cant imagine any part of the Reddit app using Google Play Services Amazing timing Just last night I was searching the web for the best reddit iOS app besides Aliens which Im using right now and the layout is pretty funky Thanks Will this app provide push notifications when you receive messages or comment replies I really enjoyed feature in Alien Blue where you can group the reddits you are subscribed to Im not sure if this is a popular opinion but i found it to be really helpful What about blackberry Not a chance Reddit I already dont trust you scumbags Why would I use your proprietary app that gives you data about me So far I like it The only thing that I notice right away that is a little annoying is that there is no option to have nsfw posts already expanded like any other post You can go in settings and make it so that nsfw posts are included in your feed but you wont see the pictures and gifs expanded you have to click on them unlike regular posts which are already open Sometimes I just want to scroll through porn The app crashes immediately upon opening I click on the app icon and it the screen goes white for a few seconds Then the screen turns black and  seconds later I get a box saying the app has crashed send feedback I type in what happened but there is no way to submit my report deleted Wait there will be ads for anyone who doesnt have reddit gold How did you determine which accounts were suspicious Edit shortened the question In my post last month I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin Any info on what subs they were posting to What is stopping these guys from doing this again Like cant they just make  new accounts So yall averaged  DMCA takedown notices per day How much time does that realistically leave to review these claims and what poor souls arewere tasked to handle the  notices received in  Why is redditcom using  CPU when all of my other  tabs combined are using  Spez How good legitimately do you think the reddit user base is at identifying suspicious accounts These dont just include Russian botsaccounts but also marketing accounts etc As such if as a whole were bad at it what can we do to improve Hey uspez on a scale of  to  how happy are you to not be Mark Zuckerberg today A more serious note thank you for your openness in this It was already much appreciated in earlier years but the current events really reminded me how amazing it really is that youre doing this Edit whooaah gold Within a minute Thanks totally completely anonymous giver Edit triple gold Yall are crazy and I love you Have an amazing day And yet I doubt any of these accounts betrayed others circles  a valuable lesson in who we can truly trust So the privacy policy since the begining of  has been vagueCan you guys please clarify what information you collect is stored permanently beyond  days besides the IP address used to create my account uspez mentioned previously only creation IPs and emails were stored in a previous transparency report post and that if only if your accounts shared IP addresses it was possible to link reddit throwawaymain accounts together My question is has that changed Like regardless of the IP Ive used to create an account does reddit know what exact devicebrowserbased on whatever canvas fingerprintingpixel tracking fingerprinting was used to create each and every one of my throwaway accounts permanently Can somebody please clarify Also the pixel tracking was removed from the privacy policy years ago but looking at the page source shows  pixels destiny delight  diversity I believe What are they used for now Will these banned users be able to delete the posts theyve made while theyre still open By listing all of these accounts publicly youre giving them lots of attention Might lead people to start looking for the people behind them It seems like ads targeting people do just as much harm as posts triggering people Have you as Reddit seen or been monitoring ad purchases originating outside the US Aka Russia purchasing ad space to push their own messagesetc Also if its possible to label the ads and who they were purchased by Similar to the UK law recently pushed that discloses the identities of groups that purchased the ads SourcehttpsukreuterscomarticleukfacebookprivacyfacebookbackspoliticaladbillsetslimitsonissueadsidUKKCNHDJD I think the canary is still gone Reddit isnt dependent on our trust we never trust anything Reddit is dependent on our skepticism  accounts is all you were able to come up with That number seems insanely low to me Edit Aside from the obvious it seems low to me because reddit is the th most visited site in the world and has by far the most time spent on sitehttpswwwalexacomtopsites Users spend almost  more time on Reddit than Facebook Thats a lot of time to spend reading divisive material Reddit is a prime target for organizations wanting to spread division and if Facebook and Twitter have millions of these accounts then Reddit certainly has more than  Reddit recently shut down subs related to sex work  other subs that may have discussed facilitation of illegal activity such as rsanctionedsuicide What are the potential implications for Reddit that made you decide to shut down the subs or were you directly ordered to do so Question when the fuck is the Reddit search engine being overhauled You keep saying its in the works but when the hell is it happening Theres recently been a LARGE increase in the number of proRussian proAssad posts  comments in rsyriancivilwar Maybe thats normal or maybe not How can YOU tell if they are actually Russian agents trying to sway western public opinion I suppose the same is true about all the proChina green posts that seem to spam certain subs or the proSaudi reform posts that seem to oddly make the front page Theres not way for us to know if they are posted from China  but can you tell or are you in the dark like the rest of us EDIT uspez you should go into politics because you did not answer the fucking question Im gay The top  in terms of karma scores have their toprated posts on these subs  TheDonald   BadCopNoDonut   news   politicalhumor   blackpeoplegifs   apocalymptics   ImGoingToHellForThis   conspiracy   HillaryForPrison   corgi   tech   gifs   gif   mediaciriticism   law   conservative   texas   politics   funny   videos   technology   interestingasfuck  Its actually really honest and open of administration to be posting such detailed information about state propoganda actors The very interesting part is how only  had more than  karma a relatively trivial amount for a real person to access Of course the actions of those accounts are the same kind of low grade pot stirring expected but with large enough and echoy enough pots stirring them only makes the nutty clumps hold together more I see you Sorting by New Good on you Keep surfing my dudes Thanks for the transparency reddit its very much appreciated transparency forsenCD People here should know that Reddit removed its warrant canary they are almost certainly communicating somewhat with the US government Not their fault Ive categorized every account above  karma based on what their posting interests were I did this by skimming the first few pages of their submissions Some of the accounts were hard to categorize At the bottom i

american leftright politics However most of the accounts general are harder to categorize They post things from both sides of the aisle but usually with a tone critical of America Some common themes with these accounts include student loan debt cost of living warmongering gun violence drug abuse police brutality or criticisms of both parties All the accounts in this list made political posts there are none that are solely focused on hobbies or conversation or anything Well a few are really interested in specific topics like cryptocurrency or islam but arent interested in American politics as much Some accounts probably bots spend a lot of time farming karma with animal pictures before getting started on generic political posts then they stop posting soon after they link to a news article on butthis dot com which is probably how they got flagged and banned For me this is my opinion the key takeaway is that this list of users does not represent just one political perspective but are trying to play all sides against each other and promote feelings of cynicism and tribalism It isnt just targeted at liberals and conservatives but the third party types as well I wish there was a way to add back another warrant canary thats more specific Like updated daily We have not been requested by a secret court to provide user data this weektoday That seems like such a low number are those simply the verifiable ones Do you expect to be the next tech giant interviewed in front of congress Guys we have group which work with fake accounts identification and reporting in Facebook Lithuania So we we simply look at the specific patterns of commenting and posting check if person have signs of being fake for example by using image search for profile photos and then report them Nowadays typical fake accounts used by Kremlin are quite good they only post  proKremlin info and most of time are postingcommenting on various neutral topics usually  times per week  minutes of work per accountuse Some of them can be used more actively By being used in such pattern those accounts are quite well masked and look like real persons At least in Facebook those accounts were started being registered around  so many of them look quite good and legitimate When farm of fakes is used to make opinion shift only part of those fake accounts are used usually  By brief look at the Reddit some posts about Russian acts we identified that usually are used around  fakes but at least on the one occasion there were around  thousand quality fakes used So correct your numbers please Here are around  fake Russian accounts active  At this point in our investigation we have found  suspicious accounts few of which had a visible impact on the site You say few of which had a visible impact and then list the accounts karma totals as evidence but isnt the content that they upvoted or downvoted also important If were looking at at least  accounts potentially connected to an outside arm looking to influence what content is popular on Reddit cant that number of accounts easily affect what posts move from new to rising to hot on any given subreddit Does reddit share our data with third party companies Edit I am referring to metadata that can be gathered for advertising purposes or government use uspez what is being done about corporate shill accounts Unban trading subs rbeertrade did nothing wrong Hey guys Americas obsession with Russia is getting really weird BANNED Hey guys my calipers tell me black people are literally subhuman and should be completely displaced and also Jews

 character limit Thanks for being more transparent then facebook has been with tracking down accounts linked back the IRA Facebook mentioned today that there may be s of thousands of accounts that may be botsactors on their platform Do you think that there could be more botsactors on the reddit platform How do you go about tracking that Also when is reddit going to be reviewing rthedonald for rules that they are obviously breaking Im not saying to ban the sub but to enforce rules for the accounts breaking reddit site rules Edit RIP MY INBOX Reminder Theres no canary How are you doing today uspez Can you describe what you mean by Trust  Safety practices Is that just automated bot detection or is there other stuff going on to determine whether a user is Russian agency born In  Reddit received  notifications of alleged copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA which resulted in  removals This is an approximate increase of  over the  notifications received in  Holy shit that is quite the increase tldr We investigated ourselves and determined that the problem was small and manageable That should keep the products happy These bots sure do seem to be politically charged even if they were not directly linked to the Russian government The update on the bots seems misleading to me it makes it seem like it is not politically charged when most of them certainly are Dont buy reddit gold people Russian propagandist criticizing Russian bot accusations Hilarioushttpsnpredditcomrbestofcommentsaueredditorbreaksdownentirerussianredditdpojdacontext Crazy that this guy has been posting until todays ban Shutout to uspez for banning a racist account I reported and sent to him through pm Dude was gone within the hour Never got to thank him for that and doubt hell see it but at least I know hes actively listening and gives a fuck Keep it upppp Thanks uspez for doing the hard work of trying to balance free speech with other ethical and legal commitments Its a hard thankless impossible task but Reddit does a far better job of it than a lot of other sites I can think of Just honestly thank you for trying and for the most part suceeding forsenCD Do you or your team have any thoughts on why there is such a wide distribution of karma associated with these accounts Thirteen k accounts seems high I just want to be transparent with you guys What actions have you taken to combat astroturfing and unidentified sponsored posts It seems Reddit wants to expand into a more traditional FBesque role but little clarification on how it will be more ethical towards users data or implementation of its algorithms Canary is still dead I dont foresee Facebook sharing the exact accounts that shared information like this This is a nice place to begin Thanks uspez There is a lot of talk about Russian propagandists sometimes Chinese propagandists Those are both very concerning of course but they arent my only concern Id be very curious to know what uspez would say in private about US propaganda If they knew such a thing was present on Reddit would they do anything about it Could they After all you might feel the hairs on the back of your neck prick up when you see something alien out of place Something that doesnt quite fit with a slightly off usage of English But would you get that from a countryman who walked and talked like you I tend to doubt it Does anyone here really think that Russians and Chinese are bad at their propaganda jobs and thats why they get caught sometimes If theyre so clumsy why dont their own people catch on Ill tell you Its the same reason that we dont catch on to our own bullshit Some of it isnt even propaganda Its just a collective blind spot to our own bullshit just like we all have as individuals only over our whole society And every society has it Would Redditcould Redditever fight that Should it Or should we be content with keeping out only the foreign influences Thank you for your commitment to privacy Reddit has been far better on this account than any noncrypto social media Ive ever used Good on ya for sticking to your principles Also I wonder for which case Indian authorities requested information On a less serious note did this woman really file a legal noticehttpswwwredditcomrlegaladvicecommentshhnylegalnoticeoflawsuitagainstrlegaladvicefor against rlegaladvice Please for the love of all thats holy can you make us not need to have Reddit Enhancement Suite to have a night mode Bright white background burns my eyes and gives me migraines and I know Im not the only one I did a complete double take when I saw the account that posted this  I wasnt quite sure how I could have gotten Reddit admin Red on my name am I alone in being exceedingly concerned that the new interface will exacerbate the already horrible problem of people commenting solely on headlines  not reading articles the new interface actively discourages clicking to read articles clicking the title pops up a modal with comments in it rather than linking to the article to get to the article you have to complete the very unintuitive task of clicking on the domain name which is unintuitive even to a newbie but to a seasoned redditor the expectation is that this would take us to domaindomainnamecom Forgetting for a moment that I dont care for this being the interface I actually think it would have a seriously deleterious impact on discourse on reddit which is bad enough asis with people not reading articles prior to commentingsharing opinions but now the interface is pretty much making that worse on purpose deleted Are reddit ads going to stay like this in the redesign  Ad  httpsiredditmediacomHHRcGUyYxletcghzxnZabnOpJEFbkzXQAGyzkpngfmjpgsbefbcadecbcccc Ad  httpsiredditmediacomyHmGcpWocJomwEnggaRDXGWTIdWdcqzrsdsWwpngfmjpgsbddecdcdeaf It seems to be the  most hated thing about the redesign Im a big fan of rcfb and browse it almost every day A few weeks ago they tweeted out that the new redesign would limit the number of flairs available so not every college team could have a flair as well as making flairs text only and getting rid of double flairs Are these changes still being implemented or do mods have the option to keep the old flair system That sub has a whole culture that revolves around flairs and it would be a shame if we lost some of that Can we have some sort of distinction between videos uploaded to vreddit and gifs or soundless videos It is very annoying if youre out in public on your phone and click on what you thought would be a gif but it starts blasting audio I would be all for putting gifs on ireddit or even greddit Would really appreciate a reply udmoneyyyyy ukethryvis uhueylewisandthesnoos  like making Classic and Compact views fill your screen coming soon D Im looking forward to hopefully more design improvements Thanks for listening to the feedback Design the mobile page to QUIT ASKING ME TO USE THE APP I dont want to use the app I will never use the app quit asking me to use the app I would rather stop using the site altogether than use an app I sincerely hope you dont make Card the default view It looks exactly like every other social network ever informationsparse displays of very small amounts of content at once This style works for Facebook but it would actively hinder peoples use of Reddit Its also not friendly to landscape mobile views where images are usually not heightrestricted to fit the screen The only advantage I can see is that you dont have to click the button to expand out the post Conversely Compact which looks like Hacker News would be a great default for textonly subreddits that dont need thumbnails Perhaps there should be an option to allow subreddits to decide what their default view is Heres some feedback The new profile overview page is awful It seems like its trying to consolidate info together but in the process it makes posts harder to track I ALWAYS use Overview Legacy because the new one is in a word trash Stop making it so I have to press more buttons or click more links to access what used to be all directly in front of me More effort to get to the same content is what ruins many site redesigns Also I want to opt out of the new social media facebook page style of profile I never chose to go to it It was forced on me I dont want it I will never post anything to it I want the old profile back I greatly dislike the changes made recently and I use reddit less now because of it so I have no faith in any new changes coming By biggest two issues with the redesign are going to my userpage and seeing thishttpsiimgurcomSzRhpng instead of thishttpsiimgurcomOrILpng For me that context isnt necessary when its a simple case of clicking the permalink to read the whole context Its just frustrating to keep track of whats going on in my userpage The second issue is that stupid pop up It makes middle clicking to open a new tab not work I want to open a new tab Thats why I have tabs So I can run through the frontpage and open a bunch of comment pages that look interesting and then one by one go through them What were the difficulties of navigating current Reddit It seems fine but thats just me I just want it to be easy to read and follow comments like it is now Please dont change that Also the new profiles suck This is such a small suggestion for improvement itll take like  minutes to implement can you stop making the vreddit posts expand in the comments page I specifically have expanding posts on the comments option disabled but vreddit just straight up ignores it Its an actual bug Please fix that shit Also get rid of that fucking new profile page Or at least give us an option to not get that shit Stop forcing that down our throats Yeah I know RES allows you to redirect it to the overview page but thats not really a fix Please stop forcing that deleted I honestly just want to see the comments rating back When someone gets downvoted to hell most people bandwagon against him and assume hes wrong without looking into the situation so they downvote When you have the downvotes but you can also see that a lot of people upvoted you might have a different insight on the comment and you might not circlejerk as much This really is an issue right now on Reddit in my opinion that needs to be addressed I understand it couldve been removed to avoid voting manipulations and what not but didnt Reddit come out with a new infrastructure about a year ago to help against this  Give communities tools that are simple intuitive and flexiblefor styling moderating communicating subreddit rules and customizing how each community organizes its content A few suggestions that will help running communities In the posting requirements add further rules that prevent submission of content known to violate rules of the subreddit While having domain whiteblacklists it should also be possible to act on the following without having to resort to AutoModerator  Block affiliate links on submission  Block or require that submissions are from known image hosts  Whiteblacklist what in todays AutoModerator config known as mediaauthor  Similar handling for shortlinks  and make the clientbrowser automatically replace the shortlink if the user chooses to  Allow rules for content that will be queued for manual review by moderators  Allow for adding body text to image posts with requirements for having a post body As an example In raudiophile and rheadphones we have a requirement that users add additional context to image posts  today they have to do this after the fact and we end up in situations where we remove posts after a few hours if its clear OP does not intend to add listening impressions or some other relevant context  Allow blocking submission of posts based on wordsphrases in posts I want to bring this to the Design teams attention httpswwwredditcomrCFBcommentsxkredditredesignqa rCFB has over  available flairs with around  currently in use Please DO NOT limit the number of emjoi flairs to the rumored    This would severely cripple much of what the sports subs view as a part of their identities Thank you for all the hard work you guys have put into this redesign I cant wait to see it in action Id love to be apart of the beta but I dont mod any subs that are active enough to warrant it udmoneyyyyy ukethryvis uhueylewisandthesnoos  Please have an option to disable that persistent toolbar at the top It unnecessarily takes up realestate  Its been said before but please make infinite scrolling and any other sort of javascript cuteness optional The scariest thing about the redesign for me is that back in  when Diggs redesign tanked the site the experience was less fragmented across desktops browsers mobile browsers and mobile apps Enough people were impacted for it to cause the downfall of the site Now in  users are split across the mobile site dozens of apps and the desktop site When the reddit redesign goes live and inevitably tanks the desktop experience there wont be a big enough backlash to affect any real improvements Sadly Im very despondent about this redesign Ive had access to the Alpha for a while now and I just cant bare to use it Its awful The design the AJAX the modals Theyre all bad There are things I like but they are few and far between The biggest misstep is taking a revolutionary approach instead of evolutionary I agree that current reddit is kind of ugly but it works There are a lot of subreddits that make a vastly improved experience and design only using CSS Reddit should have taken after them instead of making a site that looks like a hello world React project demoing how to make a reddit app I feel bad for the Reddit design team Being tasked with changing something that doesnt need changing for management who needs it changed for bottomline reasons that dont align with the users Its a nowin situation Im sure youre all good people and putting in lots of work on this but everyone knows Reddit doesnt need a redesign Its as simple as that Edit Thanks for the gold stranger  Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality you came in and told us where we were wrong and in most cases explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you  soooo About those new Profile Pages I like how simple Reddit is and it works for my usage of the site The only two gripes I have is that  its terrible to remember what goes where when trying to do a masked url and  its impossible to remember how to insert an empty line to break apart paragraphs Im constantly having to look these two things up when Im going to post It should be easily found and clickable or just somehow already built in to the design The only change reddit needed was a better search function The new overview is ugly as hell Mixing posts and comments and grayed out text and replies from other people on the users overview page is an eyesore I know this is still a ways off but Ive got a few questions about CSS  How exactly will the custom CSS feature work Will all of the elements in the DOM be given classes and then moderators can run amok like we can with the current site or will we be editing the CSS for the React components that build up the UI  Will you be able to navigate to other pages while previewing the CSS or will theme developers have to continue to use test subreddits or browser extensions to see how the theme works everywhere  Is there any consideration going into whether to allow more advanced CSS tools like SassLESS  Are we still going to be limited to KiB stylesheets Just please dont mess up the classic compact mobile site Or make the new mobile site usable Eitheror Yeah if you guys could stop peddling your app in a desperate bid to capture and sell user data and just put everything on the website instead that would be greathttpswwwredditcomrthatwouldbegreatcommentsrgeqdearcompaniesifyoucouldstoppesteringmetostjewqdidshfc I disagree with the hamburger menu on tall portrait mode screens To those users that are biased on this may have already bought small screened phones to their hand with another trade off in squinted glances I would agree more if such a menu is not only invoked by finger point presses or cursor movement and point clicks Still cant get a straight answer for this maybe you can help Will there be any effect on the reddit API What is the need to do a gray background Reddit clearly has a unique look and the current craze is all about minimalist styles The new layout reminds me of an early farkcom layout it feels like the site is actually trying to show off a  theme instead of something that comes off more modern Why not keep the blocks you have colored for votes and the space barrier but remove the gray background Everything else seems great but that dull gray is obnoxious Just wanted to comment and voice my concern because I feel like this redesign will kill all of the sports subreddits which tend to have high flaircounts and custom CSS sidebars for schedules Please make sure the redesign protects flairs and other important details for those subs like rCFB rCollegeBasketball rhockey etc I pressed the try the new design thing now I cant use reddit at all from desktop  would do it again  TIL Reddit has a Design team Roasted Recent update that changed from tapping to minimize comments to holding Not sure Im a fan  With this post we wanted to share some context on our approach thank everyone whos participated in rredesign so far THANK YOU I hope youll forgive me if I question just how much listening is going on here I posted  submissions today of problems I experienced at least  of which are major objective problems with the design Ive also upvoted and been following the threads of a bunch of other problems Ive experienced None of these threads Ive been looking at have receive any admin feedback I dont mind if you have to say no were not going to be doing that or were not sure what well do about that Its just important that you be transparent with us Let us know whats not going to be done and why or let us know when something is under consideration We need to know were being listened to and acknowledged I posted this question before and received an answer from Spez but Ill tweak it and ask again towards a member of the design team itself As Im sure youre aware almost every site that goes through any kind of redesign also goes through a long period of everyone complaining that they just want the old site back What plans do you have in place to ensure that the redesign is something that the overwhelming majority of users are actually satisfied with Feedback getting better and better with each iteration is obviously good but will there be options available to longtime users who just flat out dont want things to change How about not forcing our mobile phones to deny installation of the app every time we load it or making it way less annoying No one wants your app Oh man this is the coolest gif everhttpsireddituktxyvjgif  Navigation We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers we developed a hamburger menu on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate and filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters Judging from the gif it looks like there will finally be a way to load the hamburger click and have it collapse automatically When will that be fixed because it drives me crazy that it takes me three clicks  Ill be sticking around in the comments for a bit to answer questions and invite all of you to listen to Huey Lewis with me This is my favorite Huey Lewis and the News songhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvKCkgYhtzU for obvious  reasons  my opinion is dont fix what aint broke I dont want this ending up like digg This is great  hamburger menu is nice Add me to the list of nonfunctioning Reddit after accidentally accepting the preview of the site redesign Just  error and unable to access from mobile also I am able to access the preferences but see no option to back out of the preview or revert my settings What gives From one designer to another may the force be with you odds be ever in your favour I wish and hope for the best possible outcome Can you bring back swiping to collapse comments on the app Really dont like the double tap system and keep accidentally swiping to the next post Another request that the mobile page does NOT ask you to use the app Its  everyone knows the app exists If I was willing to use it I wouldnt be on the mobile page in the first place Its fair to assume anyone who isnt using the app by now doesnt want to If you must just make sure I know the app exists inform me ONCE My issue with this is mainly the flairs My sub using  flairs right now and each one is used I had heard it was capped at  flairs and the emojis thing just seems dumb My inline flairs and normal flairs are fine as is If it isnt broke dont fix it I know rcfb is worried as well they have like  flairs or something like that along with dual flairs They use in depth CSS Heres what I recommend allow us to keep using CSS if we so choose but allow the template thing for the users that dont understand CSS Keep the flairs Flairs are extremely easy to do Theres so many resources on Reddit dedicated to CSS and subreddit design This whole redesign is pointless imo and just going to piss off everyone Gotta say love the hamburger menu design Nice work Soyou like Huey Lewis and the News Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste But when Sports came out in  I think they really came into their own commercially and artistically The whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost Hes been compared to Elvis Costello but I think Huey has a far more bitter cynical sense of humor Nice Fix mobile android Just leave the classic reddit view for all users and give new users a choice between the two Dont pull a snap chat please  So far the new mobile site lacks features that the desktop has and I prefer the old desktop version Please dont change it I dont like installing apps and prefer to use the mobile web version The mobile web version now not only harasses you about the app multiple times but also lacks some things that I can do on the desktop version through my phone such as upload pics and see the scores on my comments What is Reddit doing to stop the influence of foreign government intelligence agencies on what should be an open forum Love what you guys do but please revert the mobile collapsing update its very annoying and you can no longer collapse comment replies Hey design team could you please stop with those popups that appear every time you look at the site whenever we dont log in Thanks Horrible plane and just another clone of a cookie cutter UX approach like all the rest of popular sites Your new profile pages failed In a way I am glad this is happening i find when a site redesigns and looses what made it unique i tend to visit less and less So thank you for helping me leave this god awful bubble POP PS How many are on your design team I am fascinated by the large amount of teams who basically work on one website these days Did these designs take a couple of years from wifeframing to end result Great Now stop pushing this stupid fucking facebook feed down my throat and maybe Ill be here in a year Your alpha invite broke my ability to access my main account I just get an error  in chrome Even my Edge and Firefox which have no extensions cant access as soon as I sign in Any assistance would be great The Reddit redesign is catered  to a younger audience with an aim at eliminating as much as possible the barrier to entry that a CSS driven platform provides The redesign is aimed to standardize Reddit the Instagramization of this website if you will Everyone and every sub will start from the same GUIfied cookie cutter template I fear what this redesign will do is make it too easy  yes sometimes thats a bad thing If you head over to rredesign youll see that my sentiments are not strictly my own I understand that the old guard of any community will wave their fists at any proposed changes but sometimes theyre right sometimes change can be too drastic too fast You guys really need to get the app working properly I prefer applications like Reddit is fun or Relay over the default app purely because of the features and degree of choice both of which are surprisingly and glaringly absent in the official Reddit app can you guys please stop digging i like this place and i dont want to find a new site to waste time on Im pretty active in rCFB We use flairs extremely heavily to indicate team affiliations as do most sports subreddits Ive been to Being able to have the team logo next to our name makes it really easy to tell what team someone roots for and its very important for almost any interaction to know that There has been some concern among the mod staff that the new Reddit design will destroy our flair system This would be devastating to the flow of conversation in the subreddit Should we be concerned Is the Reddit design team working with moderators to make sure that communities who rely heavily on flairs arent disrupted by the design changes deleted If it aint broke dont fix it Just saying Whats the logic behind no longer showing all comments on the redesigned profile pages instead showing the thread and only one comment and then requiring the viewer to expand the thread by clicking more comments So youre putting all this effort into giving us something that effectively make Reddit look like an RSS feed I dont know how to feel about this I have not been a fan of the recent design changes especially the addition of white space everywhere and the user profiles view I think the most annoying thing is that with the new design it takes more clicks to navigate anywhere Please dont break the API I havent looked at desktop Reddit in ages I use Reddit with sync your app is ok but hard to follow The desktop is fine enough but when I am sittikng at a computer I am usually working Please dont break the API  the worlds largest most passionate and genuine community of users Read You assholes So is pagination completely out Because I think most people here longer than a year actually like having discrete pages of contentand a resulting somewhat stable frontpage and have built their mental models around that I want to bitch and complain but these designs actually look nice  However I hope you maintain some legacy support I hate new profiles and new look It is just too crowded with useless stuff and makes Reddit more like Facebook And I dont like Facebook Reddit could use a redesign but a small one not a complete one New look here and there no bullshit changing how Reddit works Maybe just a CSS redesign would be great To me Reddit is fine as it isor was classically No new profiles old look with no promoted postsWTF literally the only reason I reenabled adblock on reddit and just plain simple look Reddit is good because it is simple Everything is on classic to me because I like it If I am forced with new stufflike I was forced with promoted posts I will most likely dislike it because it makes Reddit more crowded with useless things Please make exceptions to the  flair limit for sports subs or maybe large subs in general rcfb has one of the biggest flair systems on Reddit and even reducing the count to  means  teams from the FBS the top division in college football are left out I understand wanting a unified experience across all platforms but if it comes at the expense of some of the largest communities it seems like change for the sake of change rather than a wellplanned improvement to Reddit This is a small one and probably is gonna go overlooked since the last time I brought it up I was universally met with hostility over having the audacity to suggest taking away a customization option Im also probably the only one who regularly runs into this while rrandom binging but still Something that always bugged me is the ability for people to completely hide the navigation banner at the top I understand both the need and desire for moderation teams to be able to customize the look of the entire subreddit to fit their needs and that the banner  or whatever analogue will be created in the new style  should be customizable as a part of this But is there some way to reach a compromise where these navigation tools can remain universally accessible while keeping the ability for the subreddit team to customize their appearance Im okay with changing the font type size and various colors of it but nothing ruins my enjoyment of a subreddit more than the banner just up and disappearing Even if it would otherwise be a subreddit Id enjoy sticking around in So many posts explaining that you understand the design of the profile pages is super shitty but no one seems to be doing any designing to make them unshitty Less talk more work The upgrades you show still look like shit And if theyre anything like the horrendous user profiles theyre gonna run like shit too there is no damn reason it should take  seconds to load some fucking text Reddits design team really needs to check out httpmotherfuckingwebsitecom for some guidance on this issue You dumbasses keep trying to make reddit look like twitter and thats one of the many reasons I dont use twitter It doesnt work if youre trying hard and this is what we have im a little worried for the future httpsiimgurcomnETGjpg Please do something about the mobile version we cant continue thread when the discussion go too far Is it possible to swap rpopular with rall on mobile I want to click to see all of reddit the good and the bad All the feels Im on a design team myself and this cant be an easy task especially on a huge communications platform like Reddit For every user vocally complaining about something  more are silent Its important to solicit feedback but also important to pay attention to reactions Youll have users frothing at the mouth to tell you nothing needs to change but often if you look at their behavior they have a thousand little hacky and ingenious workarounds to deal with inconveniences other people havent figured out how to deal with or even noticed And yes its true that business needs are often at odds with user needs and the business objectives have to be taken into account  but there is tension there the designers are on your users side and they do fight for you in meetings with product managers and execs To the extent they can anyway which is hard when you have investors or shareholders breathing down your necks asking you to explain how this or that product decision helps the bottom line User value is often qualitative but the only way to fight for it is to use quantitative metrics Unless you have bizarrely enlightened leadership which sometimes happens Team Im looking forward to seeing what yall come up with and I understand it wont be what you originally wanted But itll be good and it sounds like you have the resources to keep improving Thanks edit thanks also to my anonymous patron How about actually doing something that will matter All the suggestions of improvements here and on rblog show you guys are out of touch Censorship is rife on Reddit and alot of it is actually done by automod and other bots Further users are not even notified by default if their contributions are not getting through Only if you log off and try cedditcom can you even find out See Try to get something past invisible automoderator or bot filters httpswwwredditcomrRedditCensorscommentsvplltrytogetsomethingpastinvisibleautomoderator How about  Being transparent about censorship and bot filters Inform users when their posts are not going through and why  Forcing all moderation to be done openly No one pays for subreddit space the least you can make the nerd moderators do to earn that subreddit space is force transparency regarding their actions rconspiracy already does that and a few other subs rModerationLog already did the work to make transparent moderation possible  Allow subreddits to disable up and downvoting All that does is gamify the medium Sure it probably makes people spend more time on Reddit arguing about karma and makes the downvoted feel aggrieved and others victorious but it makes actual discussion suck Allow subs to disable it without CSS hacks than can be bypassed anyway If you think Reddit is a good medium to post in as a user please get uspez to tell Serena Williams to create another Reddit account On that account have her identify as black womanwhich she is but dont disclose she is a famous tennis superstar in the public limelight for over a decade And have her post with an innocuous signature saying she is  year old African American women attached to all of her posts and see what happens to her Reddit is not the frontpage of the internethttpswwwthedailybeastcomredditisnotthefrontpageoftheinternet it is only the frontpage of the internet for mostly young surly white nerds who vidya game Case in point I remember most of my coworkers from the Newark area talking about the death of someone very well known in the black community in Newark Uggiehttpwwwnjcomessexindexssfnewarkstreetperformergunneddowncopsseekingthtml but in rnewark which pretends to represent a majority AfricanAmerican city in the Redditosphere no one knew or posted he died Have Serena post without being Serena but being just another black woman and you will see why African Americans and many other demographics avoid this medium like the plague Cool Nice job keep up the great work AFAIK the redesign is only accessible by moderators at the moment Do you plan on rolling out the alpha to regular users anytime soon edit looks like Im inhttpsiimgurcomlqZdJwpng So CSS is basically being shelved Please bring back the single tap to collapse comments on mobile The long hold is alright but I dont always want to collapse the whole comment thread only certain replies to the top comment The double tap to collapse single comments is cumbersome and annoying could have fooled me So why is all the negative feedback on profiles seemingly being ignored And why is rredesign private Theres really no way for the general community to give you feedback until it rolls out and its too late Edit Yay Theyre back to the drawing board on profiles Happiness I think I might be the only person in the world who cares about this but since youre on the design team here we go Right now if I never wanted to see posts from rannouncements for example I could blockfilter the sub If someone makes a post to their new profile page I cannot filter out that post There is nothing I can do to prevent that content from appearing in my feed Thats a feature that should have been implemented before new profiles rolled out Are there going to be any updates to the app any time soon Myself and most of the people I know use Reddit pretty exclusively through it You gonna integrate Spotify Remember when there was a website with serious moderator overreach admins that didnt understand what their site users actually wanted and their constant attempts to monetize the platform in intrusive bullshit ways that resulting in a giant number of them having an exodus from that site after they got sick and tired of that shit Yeah dont be shocked when it happens here deleted Please dont sacrifice usability for the sake of a clean appearance I would much rather be able to easily find buttons and settings and other things I need to click than have more white space Please dont put in mystery icons whose purpose is a complete mystery until you click on them Id rather have a less pretty icon that is more descriptive or even a word or two indicating what will happen if I click that thing But what about the desktop website Do you guys really thing that light gray text on white background  a sprinkle of orange is a good color scheme Ive been saying this in rredesign for a while but can we please do away with the whole everything you click opens in a new tab thing When I left click a link I want it to open in the same tab whether thats a link someone posted the link to my profile any of the links on my profile Every time I want to look at my saved posts I have to close three extra tabs the one I started on the first click to my profile and the saved posts page itself I read something a long time ago about why you shouldnt use targetblank on links and it boiled down to the user should choose where a link opens I really enjoy being able to choose where links open Thats how Ive used Reddit since I joined thats what my usage flow looks like And every time I click a link in the redesign it makes it feel like it wasnt designed to be used It may sound like a minor gripe but for me its a major complaint Hell Id be happy if I got some acknowledgement at all it seems like this feedback is just completely ignored You guys are bad at your job Opted to new layout constantly getting  HTTP errors Huh I just got updated to the new look of Reddit TIL The Reddit design team sucks at their job Why does the subscriptions bar need to be a permanent fixture now I know what Im subscribed to and its easy to navigate them with the drop down menu Sure the new menu is nicer than the old one but could we maybe turn it into a drop down again instead of taking up  of my screen Also whatever you did to the way your images displays broke one of my favourite parts of what I believe was a feature of RES being able to drag an image to expand it And even if I could still expand it  of my screen space is taken up by the subscription bar A conundrum never solved itself quite so easily Oh and for real Markdown isnt automatic any more I mean its a long time coming I guess but thats just annoying uhueylewisandthesnoos  thank you and the team for being so open and honest about this redesign You have had a fair whack of criticism but its obvious that despite what people in rredesign have said you are not digging yourselves a grave with that tired overused meme I have observed the improvements over the last few months and I am confident youll get to a point where people will prefer the new design It will take years for that to happen  the current design has existed in some form since Reddit was first launched in  Itll take some time before people are comfortable switching over and some may never want to but you cant hold on to such people forever wed still be using geocities if that were the case People expect it to be perfect today but thats just not going to happen With feedback and changes over time I am confident youll deliver a world class desktop experiences people will love using Im just here for the inevitable slapfight about td rfellowkids Okay I was skeptical before but this looks bitchin New designs are cool and all but when are you guys going to address systemic issues like mods abusing their powers ala httpswwwredditcomrcanadacommentschweneedtotalkaboutredditcanadaland So since users can opt out and some loggedout users now receiving the redesign as their default view via AB testinghttpswwwredditcomlivexckzbsjmywupdatesbbffeed moderators are now expected to maintain two versions of their subreddit in terms of style and sidebarmenu content Its not like that content synchronizes between sites Who asked for any of this How bout instead of design changes you get rid of subreddits that promote hate deleted we dont want this How can we design the site to be less effective in recruiting white supremacists Why has reddit refused to respond the the Washington Post regarding their recent article about the prevalence of conspiracy theories and harassment of the the Parkland Shooting Victims originating on subreddits such as conspiracy and thedonald Currently if a moderator of a subreddit is shadowbanned they can be removed from the modlist through rredditrequest Will this be the case for suspensions If so just permanent suspensions or temporary ones as well While an account is suspended from reddit the user will not be able to  Vote  Create posts  Comment  Send private messages to other users  Send private messages to subreddits other than rredditcom  Report posts  Create new subreddits  Give or buy gold  Edit flair  Edit wiki pages  Toggle posts as NSFW  Create selfserve advertisements Additionally suspended moderator accounts will not able to  Access moderation tools  Access moderator mail  Approve remove spam or ignore reports from posts or comments  Distinguish posts or comments  Edit flair  Toggle posts as NSFW  Set comment thread suggested sort  Enabledisable contest mode  StickyUnsticky posts  TLDR  They cant do anything but they know that they cant which is a good step forward For moderators I think its important that they still retain access to modmail If for some reason my account becomes suspended I need to be able to let my comoderator know so that he can pick up the slack until my suspension is done Not having access to modmail would force me to create another account to be able to do that thereby becoming another banworthy offense How will suspension lengths be determined and will there be a set amount of time per actionoffense  will this be made public Eg Vote manipulation is always  week a second offense is  days and a third strike would be a permanent suspension Additionally will suspensions replace bans entirely Is there a difference between a ban and a permanent suspension Thats solid  Does that mean those who lost their accounts in the past will be given the chance to get them back  How does the appeals process work Who makes the final call  EDIT  I know hypotheticals are often bullshit but lets take Unidan He was a hugely popular Redditor who contributed to the site in many ways If I recall correctly he had a couple of extra accounts that he used to to upvote his own content so that it would be seen and also downvote people he saw as argumentative In this case what action would you take In addition to this we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly display that the account in question was deleted by the user HOLY SHIT YES Will Gold count down during the suspension Or does the timer on Gold pause while the account is suspended I FIND THIS COURSE OF ACTION ACCEPTABLE CARRY ON ADMINS DONT MESS IT UP What would stop a user from making a new account Is it IP based Then please for the love of god update your checks so that me and my womans accounts do not get suspended every time we agree or disagree on a topic Like minded people that share the same LAN might just vote the same way I was shadowbanned like  times in a week or two for this and would really like to avoid bot ban hammers that just check Ips I cant imagine what a school or dorm does when people all vote on rgaming Awesome thanks Long time coming How does this affect the Automod shadowban workaround Are mods still allowed to use this method to effectively shadowban users Great improvements on the technical side Ive just got a couple questions that pertain to policy  Do you have tools built on the administrative side that allows you to monitor which staff members are applying these tools  Are permanent suspensions immediate once a staff member clicks the button or does it go into a state pending approval of another staff member  Is there a plan to periodically audit who is using suspensions how frequently and for what purposes request Ban Lottery rbanlottery where users can choose to participate for a chance to receive a ban of N length Ive seen this feature be unusually popular other places     length to be determined Candidates include  day  week random length Good shadowbans were dumb  Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended Why is this I like it For mods sending you banevaders spammers etc would it be easier if we gave a recommendation of shadowban vs suspension based on what weve seen so far or are you just evaluating each case individually from the ground up Permanent suspension is kind of an oxymoron Thats just a ban Can we get a retroactive time served reinstatement of uunidan If the principle is that people who are generally good make mistakes I can think of no better example His contributions are a prime example of what makes reddit great the vast majority Want to explain that What is to become of all currently shadow banned users are they to be offered another chance i approve of this notion it means users will be able to understand why they have been punished they likely wont do it again after and from the other side its the right way to handle things a shadowban is a weak spineless move from someone who is afraid of confrontation I never liked the way it was implied as such man up and tell me how i fucked up please Credit where credit is due  I think that Reddit has dropped the ball on a lot of things  but this change is excellent Thanks deleted does this mean that previously shadowbanned accounts will be set to a permanent suspension or are they still shadowbanned Well its good to see reddit is addressing this problem somehow not sure how it will play out but at least they are trying This is a good improvement and a great start Awesome work honestly This sounds like a great step forward Love the dialog and transparency here Thank you Question Does a gilded account just have to suck it up and lose the days they had gold or will the gold be suspended as well and stop emptying until the suspension ends Thats good I got shadow banned once for breaking a rule about linking a restricted website which I had no idea about No one said a single thing over a very minor mistake until a nice mod from a totally unrelated sub let me know so I could reverse it I thought that was ridiculous I could see a ton of users  myself almost included just never coming back to reddit over it Glad to see you made some changes Excellent Now please change the voting system I want to know how many people read something I said and cared enough to respond to it whether they like it or hate it If shadowbans are to be only or almost only for spammers would it be possible to remove the hidden posts and comments they make from appearing on the modqueue If youre confident it going forward it will only be applied to stuff no one has a snowballs chance in hell of actually wanting to see it doesnt seem like it needs to be there Ive noticed one of my fellow mods in the subreddit I moderate has been getting annoyed by the movie torrent link spam weve been getting from shadowbanned accounts and has banned each of them from the subreddit and removed their posts just so that he doesnt have to see them when he checks to see if there are reports or legitimate comments sorted into spam It seems like that isnt the optimal outcome Are we allowed to vote and comment on threads weve been linked to now As someone whos been shadowbanned I can tell you this is a welcome change Sometimes the rules arent black and white Oh highly politicised subs we have to continuously deal with users who are detrimental to the health of a sub who keep getting banned and return with alts An IP ban in such a case would be extremely helpful Please consider suspending theymos the moderator on rBitcoin a forum with over   subscribers that he is actively ruining or having some way for the community to do so  will vote him out be is trolling and censoring everything against his own strict views This is so far removed from the policies of bitcoin but he controls all of the discussion What about giving suspended accounts  or  PMs they can send That way they cant spam others but they can get the word if someone needs to know Its kind of like the  phone call when you go to jail I wonder how many times Ive accidentally gotten myself banned Hello Can people read this I feel like my whole life might be a lie and that I am stuck in a glass prison Someone please reassure me Im not just talking to myself I say shadow ban then perma ban EVERYONE Except the mods and admins of course they are the only ones who matter right So a perma suspension is basically getting a shadowban and being told about it True request Just created this account to see how it affects BaconReader when a user is suspended If you could indefinitely suspend this account we can be sure to prompt users as needed or show the proper responses I will come back here in a moment as one of the moderators of rbaconreader to prove that this is a real throwawaysuspension test account It would be greatly helpful thank you in advance  I was bannedsuspended from rfood I typed it like that so as not to like to their trollspace for telling a moderator that downvoting was to be reserved for content that didnt belong on reddit not to be used to show disagreement as the moderator suggested This kind of power should be taken away from people who have too much time on their hands and powertrip over some section of the internet Really how can a person justify being a moderator of  subreddits I think the suspension is lifted by now but its not like I live on reddit so it didnt really affect me and I havent been back It just pisses me off that no matter where you go and when you take the time to read and abide by the real rules it all comes down to somebody elses ego If these changes take things out of the hands of mouthbreathing egomaniacs Im all for it Congrats you guys figured out probations welcome to  forum technology I have a question about the vote manipulation thing Im worried about this the most because both My Wife and I are Redditors me more so than her but she is on it about every day just doesnt always comment and there ARE times she upvotes my stuff  Not as much as Id want is there a way to discern its my wife and not Me manipulating vote since most times were on the same IP address and sometimes it comes from the same Desktop As someone who got shadowbanned this is a nice change I did something that I did not realize was banable and got shaddowbanned with no warning or message took me  months of posting to realize thats why nobody would respond to me Kind of bullshit for not being a spammer I am glad shaddowbans are gone Purely a semantic suggestion try you did X instead of you were caught doing X It puts the emphasis on the misdeed not the catching of the misdeed This is great news Props to Steve for holding up to his commitments If nothing else this does appear to increase transparency  definitely a plus here The key here is whether the independent rd party the admins that users can appeal to is unbiased enough for the majority of appealed suspension cases and can handle the large amount of cases theyre assigned while maintaining standards Id like to see more specifics here on what systems are in place to ensure this new system wont develop any of the problems shadowbanning caused or exacerbated No matter this new systems strengths or weaknesses I think most folks will be happy to see the shadowbans go It robs the person being shadowbanned of power without their being informed and with no reasonable recourse they can pursue Im assuming that shadowbans will not be possible in the future Or will they still exist in some form I look forward to see what develops from this I like this Thought I had something more to add but guess not Maybe thats a good thing Nice job admins What happens to users that are currently shadowbanned Are they automatically permanently suspended or do they stay shadowbanned Hey that sounds like a real improvement twitch over the status quo grrrowl  face twists hulks out NnyyyyyaaaAAAARGGHH BUT WHEN WILL SRS BE BENNED EDIT Gilded fans self So a short while ago somebody pointed out this adhttpsireddityqswczktojpg to me which is an innetwork reddit advertisement for the sciences subreddit However it happens to contain this arthttpsprismatagamepediacomTeslaCoil which is used in my video game PrismatahttpstoresteampoweredcomappPrismata This art is exclusively owned and copyrighted by Lunarch Studios Inc a company I founded in  and currently am the CEO of We have not granted any license to advertise using this art to reddit or any of its parent companies So my question I actually really like rsciences and was thinking of just releasing this art into the public domain so you could help advertise their subreddit without any trouble Whats your preference between Creative Commons cc licensing vs MIT licensing Edit Im totally happy with rsciences using the art in their snoo banner I was just a bit surprised that the reddit ads team would publish those innetwork subreddit ads without checking the graphics first That kinda thing could get them in a lot of trouble if theyre not careful Edit  OK here goes Lunarch Studios Inc hereby publishes this Tesla Coil ArthttpsimgurcomaNOGBcn also linked here httpsduplwpaykcloudfrontnetprismatagamepediaTeslaCoilportraitpngversionfbaeeddecfbdf under the Creative Commons cc

 Wow this post sure blew up I just got this email from the director of wiki partnerships at Gamepedia apparently the Tesla Coil page is now the  post on their site He told me its getting as much traffic as when a new Overwatch character is announced Edit  So a few of you asked me about Prismata its basically a nerdy strategy game inspired by dominion starcraft and board games You can read more stuff or try it out herehttpstoresteampoweredcomappPrismata Our big feature is ethical microtransactions no paytowin and no card packs we mainly sell cosmetics and single player content I am a Reddit user for the last  years and I always wanted a folder system where I can categorize my saved posts and comments But I always end up forgetting or have to scroll through all the new ones Are you guys planning on something similar so we dont have to scroll through a spaghetti of unrelated other topics Edit I am not sure how this comment got this much attention Thank you everyone for making our voices heard I hope a similar feature will be implemented on the standard version so everyone can enjoy and personalize Reddit Our cookies and data are already usedsold anyways therefore I dont think this should only be a premium feature Have a wonderful Fall season northern hemisphere A couple of CEO posts ago a big deal was made about the reddit canary being taken out indicating that Reddit as a company now had to conform to federal inquisitions for user data Usually this means that a tool is made for federal investigators to gather data needed for whatever case they are working So how are you as a company taking active measures to protect users data from similar breaches like what happened to Facebook Equifax and more recently Apple Uber and Amazon Last time there was an admin post we from rargentina complained about the advertising blitz weve received from Monsanto Their ads are misleading they claim to be from reputable websites then redirect to another Our mod team has repeatedly reported it so have our users were sick of seeing it over and over and OVER AND OVER AGAIN Its like the only ad you see if you have an Argentinian IP Its nuts Please please do something about it or at least acknowledge the problem I know Monsanto is a contentious subject but forget politics were just sick of being bombarded by the goddamn ads  Can you please stop pushing the redesign so hard  Can you stop the Download the app popups showing up so frequently on mobile  Can you stop employing dark patterns such as thishttpswwwploggingdevcomimagesdarkloginpng  Email is optional and should be made clear  Can you remove the orange coloured chat iconhttpsiimgurcomIXzbYpng next to my inbox Complaining aside I continue to enjoy reddit thanks Why in the world do you ask me every other page view to download the app I like mweb I hate apps Please stop Im still on oldreddit How much longer before life support is turned off  A recent change that reddit admins have quietly rolled out is how they handle suicidal usershttpswwwreddithelpcomencategoriesrulesreportingaccountandcommunityrestrictionswhatshouldidoifiseesomeonewho It used to be that if a mod found a suicidal user they would pass it on to the reddit admins who said that if they thought it was a concern they would contact the local law enforcement near that user Now the admins have been telling us that they dont want to be told about suicidal users and that instead we should reach out ourselves to support them or send them to the user run rsuicidewatch and that if we are really concerned we should contact our local police tell them about a suicidal person on the internet in an unknown location and let them handle it This is contrary to how every other major social media twitterhttpshelptwittercomensafetyandsecurityselfharmandsuicide facebookhttpswwwfacebookcomhelpcontact handles suicidal users Why did you make these changes Do you take to heart the thousands of posts outlining why people hate new Reddit Do you regret doing this AMA yet What do you actually do as the CEO of Reddit the answers in this AMA are severely lacking in quantity transparency and honesty I feel like Im reading transcripts of Zuckerbergs testimony to Congress reddit disappoints again So the recent quarantine wave rCringeAnarchy rtheredpill rwatchpeopledie riceposeidon rbraincels rFULLCOMMUNISM rtruth rmayotown rFragileJewishRedditor rSubOfPeace rWhiteBeauty rWhitePride rGentilesUnited rZOG rGoyimDefenceForce rAganistGayMarriage rWhiteNationalism rNorthwestFront As many redditors have noticed one of these things is not like the others rwatchpeopledie is wellmoderated not devoted to hate speech or hoaxes Actually they are quite zealous in their moderation and removal of hate speech On the other hand it did present advertiserunfriendly content that reddit likely didnt want new users stumbling upon So what exactly is the purpose of quarantine Either  Quarantine is for subs like rwatchpeopledie ugly but well moderated communities that are allowed to stay on Reddit but need to be hidden away because of capitalism  Quarantine is a punishment for hate subs used to encourage them to reform or leave the platform If quarantine is being used primarily in a  way why not just ban these subs Hate subs are not going to reform their moderation policies or stop brigading other subreddits no matter what quarantine you place them under In fact all youve done is give them a safe space subsidized by the nonquarantined subreddits where they can continue to discuss their ideology and organize brigades of public subs How does Reddit officially define Hate Speech and what guidelines are in place to ensure it is dealt with objectively  Afternoon from the UK Spez rfunny here Was a pleasure speaking to you during the London Roadshow What are we working on to combat the karma farming epidemic politics and russian trolls aside theres been an abhorrent amount of sheer shitposting cluttering up the default subs I understand we could code plugins or algorithms to sustain an improved automoderating system but that sets a rather high expectation of knowledge in programming as well as a volunteer willingness to work on something so extensive All of us default mods are hugely grateful for the improvements your teams have made to ease our burden a bit but some of us feel theres still a ways to go before we get to stop spending all of our free time scooping buckets of water out of the ocean Edit great response And to everyone who seems to have a hard time understanding how new works and instead chooses to abuse the mods try keeping up with a twitch chat during a live esports tournament with no bottleneck to slow the message rate Now imagine that  Now imagine filtering tagging banning tracking groups and responding to messages at that pace Your abusive attitude towards those who volunteer their time to battle such a seemingly hopeless cause with no reward but their own understanding that they get to help the community should embarrass you Spez Im joining the chorus of others telling you to abandon the redesign of Reddit The simplicity of the Reddit page is iconic Its a million times better and heres why  I have a list of text hyperlinks that I can scan through and decide for myself if Im interested in the topic  If Im interested I click  If Im not interested I dont click  I am not forced to view crap Im not interested in  No one wants to be forced to view images Its incredibly annoying Also  Anyone telling you your website needs more zing and pep needs to be thrown out a window  Do not presume to know what I want Ill decide whenhowto what degree I will examine content  Users DO NOT want to be catered to They just want options  Forcing content upon us is a shitty use of a platform that we all love Its like your best friend pulling a chair out from under you as youre setting down Dont turn this into a lovehate relationship During the last election cycle we saw fraudulent scams by Russian Hackers How does Reddit plan to protect itself from these hackers to keep itself from being the next Facebook or twitter I would like to know how someone can accessfind watchpeopledie and similar subreddits by accident which was the excuse for why they had to be quarantined How do you accidentally search for watchpeopledie and then enter an  marked page with very descriptive titles and accidentally see something you dont want Also are you aware that the positive masculinity site youre directing people to from redpill contains

admin team regarding what appears to be shall we say selective handling of certain politicallyrelevant subreddits I am talking of course about rTheDonald If so what plans are in place to reestablish trust in this matter If not what information do you need And as a bonus question how the fuck have you missed it iPhone app Can we talk about the spam posts that look like posts but are actually just advertisements and marketing It takes away from the experience for me personally Detailed posts have shown rthedonald being responsible for pushing russian propaganda through use of coordinated bots and bogus fake articles rthedonald also frequently participates in hate speech including but not limited to antimuslim rhetoric violence surrounding neonazi rally in  death threats against John McCain and others etc When will you address this issue When will you stand up to attacks on our democracy by Russia specifically propagated through a community on your site edit heres the post outlining rthedonalds rampant violation of reddit rules sorry trolls p httparchiveisqIDX also notice its an archive because certain reddit mods were scared of the truth and deleted the original Hi uspez I have a very simple question that many many of us would love an answer to Why the fuck is rTheDonald still around and why did the Reddit admins go out of their way to nuke the post that that guy made pointing out the Russian interference within that sub  How are you preventing Russian bots from meddling with the reddit experience Are you ever going to ban MayonesaDiversityisRacism and his dozen alts and bots and remove the hate subs and smear subs he squats on He is the most prolific hate propagandist on this site yet he remains untouched and possibly even had a conversation with admins before the ban waves began in September as per his last comments herehttpsoldredditcomrAskRedditcommentsjbkfwhatisextremelyrarebutpeoplethinkitsveryeortgv I have a very extensive write up on the situation and need admins to take a serious look at it A few of his subs have already been banned such as rsjwhate but the communities he controls want out from under his rule such as rdrones With the recent changes in policy how is this individual being bypassed in what he promotes on this site edit and now within an hour of making this comment I am being harassed and called a neonazi and antisemetic by the same user who sent me violent threats that the admins told me to block him Heres the posthttpswwwredditcomrantifacommentslfneichallengeinfamousneonazileaderumrkerplunky And a bot regenerated the post herehttpswwwredditcomrAMAAggregatorcommentslfnpcichallengeinfamousneonazileaderumrkerplunkyutmcontentfullcommentsutmmediummessageutmsourceredditutmnamefrontpage Targeted harassment Thanks again Reddit I hear the anger today and I get it I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month You may not be able to vote me out but you can vote everyone else out aka we dont care about your opinions thanks for participating in the discussion today anyways more bad changes coming to reddit in the future because I have no spine and you guys have no say How can we flag spez as being a suspicious actor who clearly supports TheDonald Is there plans to allow for people to change the fonts they read reddit in to a slightly larger pool i know a few people who use dyslexic fonts to help them read easier where as when i am typing i perfer reading everything in verdana I am sure there are others people would like to use and it could be of great benefit to keeping some people around also desktop i find old reddit better and new reddit better for mobile when i use my tablet since my tablet is too old to support the reddit app Do you know what fonts we may see as fonts if a small pool of fonts is opened to us Hi Spez Can you give us any more details on the situation with td or the user that had the extremely detailed and sourced post showing what weve been saying for a long time  that td is filled with Russians and propaganda DivestTrump put a lot of effort into this and you always only ever give a nonanswer whenever you acknowledge td exists Please I think we deserve to know a little more about whats going on here When are you going to deal with the rampant spread of hate speech doxxing and brigading on your website namely deriving from TD Look at it right now Take a long hard look at how they talk about one of your coworkers significant other Is this in any way appropriate for one of the biggest websites on the internet Because judging by the recent ban waves of radical subs you have made it clear that admins arent ok with hate speech yet TD sticks around If moderators of a community cant police their communities content to keep violence doxxing brigading and harassment out then the community needs to be closed So why does a single solitary right wing subreddit get immunity Would you please explain your reasoning on thedonald They are as hateful and racist as many groups you have already banned What makes them special Update Ive got to take off for now I hear the anger today and I get it I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month You may not be able to vote me out but you can vote everyone else out Hooo boy You think this is just about liberals and other nonTrumpist conservatives whining about the election Do you really honestly believe that the furor over The Donald will go away if the socalled blue wave comes to fruition Maybe that kind of statement would be relevant if people were complaining that The Donalds users were going around and arguing the benefits of government deregulation and trickle down economics But thats not what theyre doing and thats not what people are complaining about and you know it And lets not get started on the fuck you that kind of a statement is to your nonUS users who have complaints against The Donald When will Banano tipbot be default in every sub ubananotipbot  will you at least quarantine rTheDonald yall know it is toxic Trebuchets or catapults  We dont take the banning of subreddits lightly but we will continue to enforce our policies Unless its TD right In the days immediately following the news that Russian troll siteshttpswwwthevergecomredditthedonaldrussiatrollfarmirainfluenceoperation were again infilitrating theDonald subreddit there were at least  Russian posts on the front page in the two weeks following including two cat picshttpsiimgurcomkFJFNjpg and a story about Russian missleshttpswwwredditcomrinterestingasfuckcommentsjmgkrussianantishipmissilesforcoastaldefence followed by an AMAhttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsleyqiamdmitrysudakoveditorofrussiasleading from a journalist from a Russian propaganda site Is this a coincidence edit Fixed a link dab Cool all the questions that should be answered are being ignored by the great and almighty Reddit team Spez be aware that as soon as a viable alternative comes around Reddit will be remembered as digg but with more Russian propaganda and hate speech Good job Also lol at your update you may not be able to vote me out Dude the ONLY reason you havent been kicked to the curb is because all those bots bring your board ad revenue Youre morally bankrupt and I cant wait to see what happens when all this shit catches up with you Reddit Facebook Twitter and any other social media site that refuses to do the right thing have fucked up the US and online interaction in general beyond repair This is on you Enjoy your fucking flight deleted This AMA did not go as planned did it spez Why is reddit so slow to banquarantine subreddits that clearly breach its policy or at least take action against toxic subreddits that ruin reddit for everyone I really love reddit and all that it offers and I dont think everyone I disagree with should be banned but if subreddits are ruining the user experience by brigading and promoting hateful nasty content shouldnt some response or at least some acknowledgement take place quicker I feel like it only hurts reddits image to take such a wishy washy stand on extremist subreddits that promote violence against minority groups and it drives new users away that see reddit as nothing but a platform that allows hate on it Do you know about sunk cost fallacyhttpsyouarenotsosmartcomthesunkcostfallacy and how your new Redesign may not be a good idea despite the time and resources you invested in or how may you personally like it Why dont you ban TD already deleted Can we get an update to remove the incessant This content is best viewed in our mobile app or view Reddit in the app because you deserve the best pop ups I get when I click on any story Or even just a dont remind me again option Im aware that you have an app and that you really want to push me to use it but Im not going to  Im ok just using the browser All those pop ups do is make it annoying to browse your site it wont make me download an app it will make me stop browsing your site Any chance for flairs on mobile at any point Looking forward to an update Lately my app has been crashing almost to the point of being unusable  which is unfortunate as I love the design of the app Im on Android by the way Some things that have triggered crashes  tapping on links and trying to X it out to return to app  posting comments  tapping back or X on a post to go back my feed Hope these little bugs are patched up soon  Isnt this worthy of a  on android Looks good so far Update Ill clarify my assumption The android version number is likely about versioning what the coders see The iOS version number is likely about versioning what users see This is all well and good but could you stop actively sabotaging people who just want to browse reddit on their mobile browsers instead of in the app You have obnoxious popups and nag screens on the mobile website which isnt nice  Sometimes I want to browse reddit on my phone as part of my daily internet catchup and I flit between a couple of different sites reddit being only one of them I dont necessarily want to close my browser find the reddit app open it wait for it to load and then only be able to browse reddit for a couple of minutes httpswwwredditcomrmildlyinfuriatingcommentsktpdifiwantednotificationsiwouldhaveallowed Thoughts Please stop trying to push chat on us Nobody is using it and I cant think of any reason why they would Removing my user page from the quick access bar at the bottom to replace it with chat is just absurd and I cant think of why anybody would want that EDIT I accidentally many words and repair them will I ever be able to hide the GET REDDIT MOBILE banner at the top of my page I use a Windows Phone and there is no app to get I am using the desktop page on my phone fwiw Cant see the update yet Do you guys do TestFlight betas of The iOS versions Id love to help test those out if you do weird for a moment I thought the title said It is Wednesday my nudes Hello fellow kids                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I would like to be a part of rredditandroidbeta subreddit Any help So I can file more bugs over there and make reddit better Edit We made reddit greater till now As you know me and my analytical skill REALLY digging the update so far But how do I view the Hidden tab now The Saved tab for my saved posts and comments is there but where is my dear hidden posts and comments tab  So what about those of us who choose NOT to use the mobile app and just use Safari At least remove the ads for Reddit gold members Edit here is one examplehttpsiimgurcomWDjAVcpng of what I mean My account has Reddit gold and I still see ads pretty much everywhere If you dont see it its the go army ad And please remove the ads begging us to use the mobile app Were all tired of seeing thishttpsiimgurcomPbGGSlpng in our face all the time Is there no way to view your friends posts anymore Seems support for it is always in hindsight I remember upgrading a version in the past that removed friends name in the post list which made it difficult to see who was posting what on my rfriends Can you bring back the hidden section on our profiles thats where a friend of mine kept his research Didnt even tag me in the wednesday frog Literally unplayable Thanks for updating the app I was super excited when I saw the fresh new look Well done Woah I almost have the same name as you i didnt even realize until now I dont know what it is but every time I get one of those pop ups in the app that asks if Im enjoying the experience I go into a blind rage and it happens so fucking often For the sake of my blood pressure is there any way to reduce the frequency of those I am not interested in being a power user of the app I mainly use it because I hate the popups on the mobile site so apologies if theres some way to turn those off in the settings tat Ive missed Once our government creates a feasible technological method to upvote a human being youll be the first to experience such a thing From me You know why I love Wednesday frog boot deleted I hate hate hate the nagging modals to try and get me to switch to the native app when I browse reddit on my iPhone Please just let me browse on the iPhone without nags everysinglepageload edit Ha posted this comment before reading the others Appears many many users are quite vocal about this Such a dumb thing to constantly have Thank you again dude and happy holidays and Christmas and all the greets from down under in Australia I posted this in the rredditmobile thread but Ill post it here It used to be two touches to get to my own comments profile  my comments Now its three touches but realistically its five since Im on the  and use my phone one handed most of the time double tap for reachability  Profile icon  my profile  my comments You can do better Is this something youre looking at udmoneyyyyy Merry Christmas deleted Im tired of the constant spam in the app in my front page and on news articles for other subreddits I already visit Recommended subreddits Ive had to turn off at least twice now But theres still that pointless Recently Visited Subreddits bar I know I visited them recently Ive got them in a multi No I dont need to subscribe and pollute my front page with all the random nonsense that entertains me on Reddit The iOS app is altogether too pushy with wanting me to subscribe to every subreddit under the sun I cant imagine what a putrid mess my front page would be in that case I like my organization thanks Why did you take away the preview of what website a link comes from When browsing political posts it is really great to be able to ignore posts from extreme right  left wing sources Can you please for all that is holy allow a Dont ask me again on the website version when it asks if you want to download the mobile app on  separate screens every time I go to the site Cookies are your friend  I realize you work hard on mobile app but I dont want to download it and likely never will removed Woah woah woah Multitasking Do you guys not want me to get any studying done Is native Android better than Reddit Is Fun yet I love the new app on iOS Works a ton better than the last version Kudos Reddit team Im on the iPhone but cant seem to find my upvoted posts on the new update Can someone point me in the right direction Has anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like In regards to the mobile app Can you reply to me so I can tell my friends that Im cool pls My god I hate the recent updates so much Gifs auto load when I tell them not to When they auto load it shuts off Spotify sound so I constantly have to flip back and forth Videos also dont stop when I press pause The video stops but the audio continues Now I see why people use other apps For fucks sake Ever since this update reddit constantly crashes on my phone was fine before the update since the update its pretty much unusable and veryyyyyy slow I have an LG Escape  would have contacted support but if I do too much on this app like search for support it crashes When I click on an image gif to view it app crashes  iphone  reddit beta tester The mod features are going to make me so happy Hello Since I updated my Reddit mobile app a few days ago it is very laggy and crashes a lot especially when I want to see a picture or when I want to write a comment No response from app message displayed It is less enjoyable to browse Reddit now  I am on Android  I think Im not the only one but I report that to you so you are aware and maybe can find a solution Have a good day  This new update is baddddd My phone freezes whenever I try to comment The posts I open go to unopened whenever I switch subs so I have to guess if it is content I already have seen App is broken on Android Constant freezing and crashing every time I try and browse a sub upvote type a comment etc Not a pleasant experience Also please darken the font Its too light and looks way too similar to the font colour after I click a post I just want to say directly to you thank you for the service you provide all of us you are the hero Reddit needs If ever you are in Seattle first round of tacos are in me Whaoh love the new features and cant wait to try them all Thanks a ton Holy shit the Android one changes the game Is there a way to see your upvotes I was sorry to see that go deleted since this update when I click on a post that is a gif i cant watch it but rather only see a static image with a play icon I cant click I have to go into the comments view to actually watch it anything I can do on my end App is slow and keep crqshing i dont even see what im tyoing right now New update sucks just rerelease the old one No one asked for a glitchy unusable app Can we have the friends comments and post back in the next update please Why wont you let me rotate my device I want landscape orientation on posts And until I have the option to do this I will never use the official Reddit app Why do you do this I spent most of the day arguing with developers today at work so my question is would you say that a narwhal is a unicorn in a suit or a unicorn in a submarine Looks great Ps did you have a good reddit Christmas Yeah could you please NOT try to shill your mobile app on every ocassion when I use the mobile webpage Also the webpage is kind of slow even on a flagship phone Some people cant or are not allowed to install rd party apps on their phone but still want to get the full Reddit experience Thank you The new updated interface sucks Yes I know the update is through on my device since stuff changed how they look The new update brought a lot of instability to the app Seriously Ive to wait half a minute or so from swiping the first word to it registering because apparently the old stable interface which had no issues needed to be replaced Anytime I do like anything except scrolling it has a half a minute load time And NO my phone doesnt suck the previous interfaceversion worked like a charm And it doesnt affect other apps So it has been  days since the Update has been released and I want to tell you that i experience a lot Lagg since Whenever i want to start typing a comment my screen freezes for  seconds or so before i can type Is anyone else experiencing this its official Reddit is Broken for me I have extreme Lagg whenever i click something My Karma doesnt go up I get frozen screen like a billion times I honestly prefer using the desktop version when Im on my phone or tablet  you guys know how much common that is I mean do you get to see how many are using the desktop version on mobile devices Guys fix your video player This is a nice announcement my dudes Is there a way to view posts Ive upvoted I can only find saved posts and there was tons of stuff I liked in my upvoted list Recently imgur links have been opening chrome instead of loading in app Is this new or a setting Any way to change it back Android app So when are you going to fix the update for Android It still sucks rfellowkids I cant install it I have a Galaxy Win Duos android  and it says it isnt compatible Is that really the case Its not THAT old deleted Will there ever be on a option to go into landscape mode Anyone know where to view your upvoted posts on mobile Is there any way I can join the iOS beta Im okay with the new interface even though the last one was waaay cleaner The problem is the app keeps crashing on me after this update It seems to be happening when I keep it open for a longer time or scroll through longer threads Which kinda sucks my dude trying to write this comment it crashes  times already this update is one big fuck up looks nice but not useable pleaaaaase fix it Sorry to say but after this new update the app crashes a lot Hope you guys can fix it Did you really need to take away the Friends section Please get rid of the chat button and put settings back on the main menu on ios Allow fast switching to be where it was before Put back history and all the other menus that you moved to a internal menu pulldown I dont know why you guys continue to remove good features for features that no one asks you for If it had full support of all mod tools Id use it I like the new update The only thing I dislike is the recently viewed subreddit and similar futures They lag my device  Will we ever have the power to disable that feature Ever since this update  of gifs dont load or even exist for me And the ones that do only work once and then you cant watch them again are you hiring for iOS or Android So far so good for me except for one leeeetle thingwhen I swipe a gif while I have it in full screen it goes to the previousnext gifimage post I cant swipe back to return to comments anymore Otherwise yall have fixed almost everything Good job and merry Christmas Android user here and overall I love the update However I do have a problem with massive amounts of lag I literally was only just able to see my own typing at the beginning of this sentence No other apps I run experience these issues and this did not happen before the most recent update Im not sure if this os the correct place to ppst this but I though I would make a comment And see if I can get a response With the new Android update my phone often hangs for a second or few when I start writing a comment and it takes several seconds to open a photo where my phone just hangs while it appears to be trying to smoothly transition So farm Im not excited its painfully slow amd buggy Holy whiskers you go Reddit Slick video Is there any way to reenable swiping to toss the image Im looking at and return to my feed Now when I swipe it just goes to the previousnext posts image instead of back to the feed In order to return to my feed I have to click the image once to bring up the X that allows me to close it Maybe Im missing something but Im not a fan of this Ive been a fan of the mobile app since day  and have used it over the website since This update makes the experience so much better everything is much more convenient runs smoother and looks crazy good A on this guys awesome work This update keeps causing my app to lag andor crash Still doesnt hold a candle to alien blue sigh How do I view my own comment and posts I miss having a direct link to my profile and seeing it replaced with a chat function I can promise that I will never use is a huge disappointment Did you change anything regarding the enjoying reddit popup I remember it was annoying because if I click yes its going to stay there for a while but if I click no it will disappear quickly leaving me to browse in peace App users what does it offer you that the mobile web interface doesnt I tried it a while ago but for what I do it didnt offer any advantage or at least not enough to justify being a separate app Curious as to what I might be missing Any plans for a mode thats similar to the UI of Alien Blue deleted While were looking at the mobile experience would it be possible to make the website stop forcing me into the mredditcom version from the redditcomcompact version Love the speed reading button Going to make use of it a lot Already loving it My dudes Why you mess up my UI I liked the old one Takes too many clicks to get to my profile  Is there a way to default to desktop version of the site on mobile phones I prefer it but have to manually set it individually for each page I load up Ironically manually setting the page still usually loads the page faster than waiting for the mobile version to load Wondering if Id get lucky too Never got gold  The new update has left Reddit chock full of bugs The load time is slower than a snail Reddit is constantly crashing and text and images will not appear I like the new update but theres a few annoying things The app freezes when trying to write a comment During writing my app freezes the keyboard vanishes and after a few seconds the keyboard appears again Very annoying Never had this before It keeps crashing Sorry but since i updated the app it has been so slow when trying to write comments or go back when tapping a post how can I solve this fuck u udmoneyyyyy Been jumping back and forth from Apollo and the official reddit app Maybe this seals the deal  Does this mean you further abandon the mobile site deleted I hope the site will not be a pain to browse without being logged in on mobile Right now so much space is wasted When Im scrolling through the app sometimes the photos on a post change from what was originally posted Usually its a photo from a different post but sometimes its one I havent seen before The video at the bottom is very well made Wow this looks amazing Will we be able to add flair on mobile Eugh corporate trying to meme This new font hurts my eyes Is there a way to reverse The reason i used the original reddit app is because it looked nice and clean You know I think all these free improvements are seriously dampening my sense of pride and acomplishment Please add support for sidebars if you havent Sidebars tell users what rules there are in a subreddit and what a subreddit is about Many mobile users never see the sidebar There needs to be a way for the content of the sidebar to be obvious to mobile users Why should I switch to this over my current Reddit app Wow I didnt know Reddit didnt have a native app until last year Thats crazy but the app looks good Fantastic app Its been getting better and better Understandably the app started out worse than third party ones but now I only use Reddit mobile Cant believe how good this app is Kind of you all to push something out with Christmas around the corner UI is so amazing rcomedycementery my dude Can you gives tips to discord in improving their mobile app too Rediscord OTP So now that weve tried it for a few days am I the only one who thinks CAN I GET THE OLD VERSION BACK This version has been freezing constantly on my Samsung and on the Androids at work A few times a day Ugh Its not that I dont appreciate the new features but it is now REALLY slow even with a fast phone and plenty of memory and freezing all the time It seems like its no longer possible to find a list of what has been upvoted in the app Ive been a mobile user since about June  The improvements the app went through in the last  months are substantial and have made it much easier and funner to browse Reddit on the go I especially like how well your own video uploading platform works on mobile Those gifs akways load PS please fix the thing where while youre watching a gif another gif from the post beneath will flash ontop of the gif youre watching If it wasnt fixed in this update Still no swipe to hide Is there a reason I still cant block people on Android mobile Still cant figure out how to edit flairs on iOS The update says that this is possible So this is for the reddit app Cool work I appreciate it but there are people like me who browse reddit on mobile browser for certain kind of reasons Anything for people like us We would really like to see improvements or at least some sign of you still working on the normal reddit website on mobile browser The iPad app is still just the iPhone app turned sideways Tons of wasted white space on either side in landscape mode Do you guys not try these out on your target devices Users we dont want this Reddit  we have reviewed the communitys views on the changes and determined that the changes will be universal as everyone wants them TIL Reddit has a follow user feature You know whats weird here despite the hanging around in the comments the admins havent replied to a single person asking why or showing a sign of dislike for this move It would appear we arent the people reddit cares about its clearly trying to appease someone whos not the users commenting here The whole tone of the message is we know you wont like it but were doing it anyway Will users be able to block people from following them Why cant reddit just stay reddit instead of trying to copy other social platforms The main reason many of us are here is because reddit isntwasnt like the others Not being able to opt out of followers is really shitty Reddit is not Facebook I am here to be reasonably anonymous and that means I dont want fucking anybody to follow my profile Cut this shit out Theres a reason I have zero social media Its because social media is toxic and you should be ashamed of yourselves This isnt about transparency at all This is a thinly veiled were going to be Facebook now but dont worry because you can block people Fuck that No thank you Reddit has never been Facebook and there are plenty of us here because it offers an alternative to the issues on other social media sites Please dont force followers on those of us who prefer our Reddit to be more of an antisocial media Will there be a way to block your profile from being followed by others We dont want to have to block every follower as they pop up we want to turn off followers entirely Why is reddit turning into FacebookInsta We are here because of the anonymity For God sake leave it this wayI highly doubt what you are claiming Half of us dont know these new features and how come so many redditors become so particular about it Im confident this has absolutely nothing to do with transparency This is one of the major prerequisite steps needed towards having profiles of influencers and famous people with those little blue check marks next to their name ala Twitter It also provides the linkages needed to understand and subsequently sell interest hives and associative data for advertising So if you follow me six months from now based on associative interests youll have clown porn related ads in your gmail Youre welcome I appreciate the staged rollout but I dont see anything explicitly addressing sockpuppets If I want to stalk you and you block me cant I just go register a throwaway and follow you that way Without the ability to lock down follows or disable follows from the root user rather than the account youre going to have dogwhistle harassment and users that operate in controversial spaces will end up with a chore of constantly manually blocking followers Could we get a bulkblock tool or rules all redditors active in XYZ sub Redditors with insufficient karma  account age Best yet shadowban blocking so the following party is not alerted to the block Edit  when I posted this it was way down in the list and I didnt expect this response rate I dont work for Reddit and Im not a moderator here or elsewhere Ive seen theres a lot of commentary about if you get pushbacktoxicity just delete and start over when users behave like that en masse they contribute to fostering an environment without accountability in the user base and creating a database without trends and patterns which makes Reddits ability to sell ads and services hella weak Reddit has to make money to provide the platform Users have to have some form of accountability or the whole thing turns into a shitshowhttpswwwpennyarcadecomcomic We have that with karma account age and post history things that allow users to guesstimate if theyre having good faith discourse reading a scam or dealing with an expert I dont think the solution to any problem should be put up with it or leave That seems terribly defeatist and wasteful Reddit was supposed to be anonymous If you block someone from following you they can easily go to your profile without being logged in and stalk you that way Not feeding this information through API is completely BS Why are you forcing me to use this app Its not like I hate this app Far from that actually But having an open API that can be used to build rd party clients and then not feeding all the information through is it completely BS First it was Reddit chat and now this Reddit is a community not a social media Leave it like that If I want to be on a social media Ill go to Instagram If I want to privately talk to people Ill go to discord If I want to take part in a community of people I come to Reddit Dont try to turn it into a social media Im not aware of any other place like Reddit where you can find communities about anything talk about it get help from people and much more I dont like where this is going and I think other redditors dont either Translation We are doing a bunch of shit that our users dont want or need without consulting them because we can We purchased Reddit thinking we could turn a great internet asset that people used to connect to each other into a great place for advertisers to connect with consumers but it turns out we are horribly incompetent and are now flailing around trying to add features and butchering the user experience in the hope that some of the shit we fling against the wall sticks No its not optional I dont come on reddit to follow people No one I know does You guys either have shit research or are just outright lying Looks like the overwhelming response is please dont force this on those of us who dont want it Does that factor in to your thinking on the process at all Or do you think theyre a minority you can afford to lose Is there a reason for having this feature How does it benefit Reddit You already have a decent platform as is why change it Do you think being more like Instagram will make more money Asking out of curiosity not rhetorical Im really unsure if I feel like I can use Reddit any further after this update I come to reddit so I dont have to deal with interpersonal drama and Id really rather have a place where I can say something and have anons agreedisagree with me Its more comforting in the fact that your thoughts and opinions can resonate across the world without having to tie your name to them in my time on Reddit Ive come to the conclusion that if I put my vibe out there usually it will come back to me Through others resonating with it across the planet I can seed ideas across the planet this is really cool If we remove the masks of anonymity it just takes away this place where I can say whats on my mind even if its wrong because the worth and value of your ideas are then based on how many followers you have If in  months the front page is just filled with influencer reddit accounts ie gallowboob then I have no reason to stay here anymore If the thoughts and ideas of only a few hundred people out of hundreds of thousands are on the front page that just makes it easier to manufacture the tones and positions of the rest of Reddit We lose what makes us unique a place where we can share ideas and either be agreed with or shunned and then being updowndooted into oblivion If followers are added we are only more prone to boosting the thoughts and ideas of very few rather than the rest of the userbase Im pretty scattered about this Im not sure if all of us desiring this is a good way to describe why this change is coming This is the first Ive even heard of user profiles Hi umjmayank Quick question  will these changes apply to the old friends feature on the legacy site In other words if someone goes to my legacy profile page and hits that green  friends button will I be able to see them as one of my followers Or is that friends function being kept separate from followers Thanks for reading As an aside I really like the friends feature  its nice to be able to view friends posts when I choose to by visiting rfriends without having them hit my front page as subscriptions I know its an old feature but Im really hoping itll stick around for those of us that still want to use it regardless of whether its covered under the transparency changes you all are making And there it is Another step in turning reddit to full on social media profilespages Dude no We dont want that at all We dont want this to be Facebook Twitter or instagram Cant you just keep reddit how it is Fuck you and your shitty new social network features Hi everyone We collect a lot of feedback from you all and then we wipe our asses with it when we cant be bothered to just ignore it outright This sounds like a terrible idea I dont want reddit to become the new facebook Stop turning this into a completely different website The day you take away old reddit is the day I never come back TIL you can follow users Id never even noticed that option before I rarely even look at peoples profiles Question why was this seen as necessary Cant wait for follow me on reddit And you didnt make it so we can block people from following Honestly with reddits format it doesnt even make sense youre clearly just grasping as the straws of other social networks to try to stay relevant How about you do what redditors want most and not what people from other social networks want most Oh right because redditors have never mattered to reddit you only care about getting new users make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them You know youre just encouraging people to have multiple accounts right Its so weird to me that you would make a statement like make sure youre comfortable meaning you clearly know your audience but youre just doing this stuff anyway I dont like these decisions at all but Im at least thankful that oldredditcom still exists Please never ever remove that feature  Which means brigading and troll stalking will be even more apparent so what will be the rule changes to deal with that aside from whining to moderators when you see someone following you just to harass you deleted Who the hell thinks we want followers or want to follow anyone Youre going to Digg yourself reddit Be damn careful  I want to stop anyone from following me I do NOT want reddit to be another twitterinsta I dont want a follower count on my profile Please give me that option  The mobile app still blows It seems to need to bank about mb of storage space for temporary files This is really inconvenient for people with budget model phones i only have like  apps installed that arent mandatory and reddit somehow takes the most space If I restrict reddits hard cache space then the app goes even more fucky than usual and crashes every few minutes The app isnt very reliable in the first place so more fucky is like really fucky Why the fuck would I follow somebody on Reddit So we can now follow the follower following us but they can also see us following them as a follower Reddit  we designed a new thing that potentially leaves you open to harrasment Me  and you included an option to disable it right Reddit  visible confusion Me  its a basic feature of all other platforms that you can block other users as a means of self moderating bullying Reddit  sweating intensifies uhh yeah Maybe umm Well get back to you It sounds like you collected feedback from users with followers and they said they wanted to be able to see who was following them But did you get any feedback from users who follow a lot of people but dont have followers themselves It seems like a somewhat one sided feature people with a lot of followers benefit heavily but people without followers dont get the benefit of seeing who other people are following Also will this information be available through the API How many users actually asked for this This sounds more like a smart way of saying we want to become more like Instagram and motivate you to get more followers This isnt Facebook I dont want a profile Increasing this feature will just make many users create new accounts more frequently How do I disable it entirely As in I want to check a box that says following this user is not possible Where do I find the checkbox for that Is this why you took away the friends feature on the mobile app Watch as all the  year olds start unfollowing porn accounts If someone desperately needs followers on Reddit they should make a subreddit like all of the other porn models Theres absolutely no reason for individuals to have followers on their u profile Literally noone cares about this This is Reddit not Facebook or Twitter How about adding something that is genuinely useful Like the ability to block certain subreddits from being shown to you Or how about taking time to fix your mobile app Seriously is this what you guys have been doing Working on a basic forum function that has existed for decades Instead of controlling your advertisers fixing your app or actually moderating the site This is great Now I can finally see who my two followers are Oh god no please no NOOOOOOOO Will we be able to stop other users going to our profile and seeing every single comment weve made across every single subreddit Actually I dont want people to see what I comment on or any of that I got away from Facebook because I dont have any anonymity on there Basically Ill piss off a lot of friends Reddit is my escape and I wish I could tighten up the security on that end Next update will be reddit stories You heard it here first folks So this follow feature on the new reddit is it the same as add user as friend in old reddit Would user that I have added as friend would know that I added them as friend Is this stuff only visible on new reddit I am not switching to new reddit ever unless forced lol Fuck now I gotta worry about my ratio Wtf is this instagram shit reddit Why the fuck does reddit even need followers I care about someone elses comments so much i need to read every time they say something Its fucking retarded and will encourage stalking and bullying if you cant turn the feature off Redesign sucks Time to find a new platform then But I dont want followers Or the new profile Stop turning Reddit into Facebook K so how do you actually view the list Just one more terrible step in this site becoming a social media platform like facebook Down and down the drain this site goes Thanks for letting us know We collect a lot of feedback from you all and ignore it and want to turn the site to myspace  Reddit is a forum not social media stop trying to make it into myspace  pls Followup question Is there a meaningful Block feature  where the signedin user account that was blocked can no longer see  vote  message  interact with the blocking users content  coming The current implementation of block on Reddit  where the messages and notifications dont show up in my inbox  isnt sufficient for situations where a group is threatening to harm me If I never see their delivered threats I can never take suitable steps to effectuate my own security  contact law enforcement  collect evidence for a lawsuit  report the behaviour to Reddit adminsitration It doesnt do anything except prevent me from seeing lowlevel harassment and taking appropriate actions to prevent it from escalating to something worse When do we get a meaningful Block user feature Edit already answered as on the roadmap with no commit date Reddit is trying to weasle into the social media space and its not going to work Redditors are going to leave and youll just get facebook users switching over and be the new facebook Then ofc the content goes downhill And the site becomes shittier and shittier Great now let users set their profiles to private How can I prevent anyone from following me I dont want to be followed So is this rolling out on the th or th And how do you do it I think the biggest issue here is the lack of understanding on what it means to be a follower If you follow someone the posts they make to their profile is added to your home feed just as if you subscribedjoined to a subreddit but that subredddit is their profile posts Normal posts to other subreddits are only included if the follower happens to be subscribed to that community From my experience most users on Reddit dont understand this difference just look at the comments on this post and they most likely never even post to their profile I think that process should be clarified although Im not sure how but its definitely not clear Im pretty sure the most consistent feedback youve gotten is that people dont want or care about followers This aint fb or instagram I dont want to follow anyone or have anyone follow me How do I see According to this I should see new followers after the th Its the nd now and I just got a new follower Was there supposed to be some notification Because I didnt see any Where do I see new followers Its been  days since the th has this been abandoned WTF is a user profile My question would be if there is a function coming with it that allows people to block followers so they cant see what you post anymore etc Edit question got answered on someone elses thread How do I see who I have followed And here I am having never switched to the new reddit profile system Will we have the option not to show up on other peoples list of followers Thats kinda one of the main reasons a lot of us use reddit Will you be able to keep a user from seeing your profile like blocking them Um didnt know there was a follow feature to begin with Dont like this though That defeats the whole purpose of the platform no Thank God The quicker reddit turns into Facebook the quicker the site dies and is replaced Wheres the button that forces people to follow me and be friends All we need is the ability to be followed or not It accomplishes the exact same thing while maintaining anonymity If everyone here knows this why dont you People arent here because they want it to be like every other social media theyre here because reddit is unique in the very aspect that is being slowly gotten rid of You realize that this is going to make Reddit a platform for Influencers and attention whores Having followers will just make people try to get more followers Hey guys FOLLOW ME AND ILL FOLLOW YOU BACK AND GIVE YOU SWEET KARMA FOR ALL YOUR POSTS My followers will get to request the content they want the most Ill keep product placements and ad mentions to a minimum Now that I can see you following me I can create a truly influential social media presence on Reddit that youll love Of course it gets expensive so be sure to hit me up for some really cool swag that you can wear If you love Reddit youll love my content and swag the most While I get youre just responding to user feedback to add this feature I worry about the negitve reaction a user like me will see from it I have about k followers and with the content I post our Pornhub channel that well lose followers and not gain new ones for fear of being exposed of following us Will or can they keep their anonymity if chosen Reddit turning into facebook deleted Lets not Why can I block user profiles but their promoted posts still show up on my page I have no social media accounts I dont want one Ive essentially isolated myself for the past  years after getting harrassed for leaving my ex Both irl and online I joined Reddit to ask one question a couple of months ago Im new here and I love it so far but Ive already worried about anonymity and wished Id chosen a more difficult to track username I also know how I feel about my kids or my spouse or exspouse being able to follow me Im not here to make new friends either so I will not be participating in any social media types of features I dont care if there are profiles I just want to be able to make mine private so I can stay here peeking out of my little shell feeling safe while not feeling all alone in the world anymore THANK YOU As a female with followers Ive been worried about who the followers are since it popped up on my profile If its someone from one of my hobby subreddits cool if its my stalker ex or any ex to be honest definitely not cool It made me very uncomfortable not knowing who my followers were umjmayank I received the PM that I followed someone I dont recall doing that and dont see any place to see who Im following Where is that located Also are you saying that on  people can see any follow that is made on that day but not follows made before then Then about  months later people can see follows that were made prior to but only if those people are still following them Since you set an expectation of privacy and youre going to break it you need a new optin Specifically I should have to opt in or reactivate any follows before they suddenly become transparent because they werent transparent to begin with If a user is away from Reddit for three months starting yesterday your rollout plan will betray their trust This is such a terrible decision PMMEANALBEADS has just started following you xB I cant wait for the new rollout  Thanks a ton  xB s Please dont do this it sounds horrible  BRB Ill unfollow everyone Thanks for making Reddit less anonymous When you say  move the new profiles out of beta Are your referring to the updated profile page that we look at If so will there be an option to retain and continue seeing the original style I ask because as you have been made aware many times the new design is worse than the old when it comes to user experience Its slow clunky and inefficient in space While we can opt out to the old style it would be a step backwards to force us to use the new design for profiles regardless of our choice Welp This will get real awkward real fast The more this becomes like Facebook the quicker Facebook will buy it just to destroy it As a business plan I guess you guys are on track How about you roll back all of the new shitty features that users came to Reddit specifically to avoid I cant help but notice that the only comments OP acknowledged were positive ones Way to be a completely seethrough echo chamber rwatchredditdie I got the message about following someone in the past but I do not remember following anyone Now I want to delete the people I may have followed so I dont show up on anyones creepy list but I cant find the setting to do so I cant find anything about following and Ive clicked through all my settings profile inbox etc I appreciate the warning but tell me how to adjust my settings I even searched subscription list in your helpsupport section and it came back empty Come on Reddit If we unfollow now that will not be revealed though right Only if we follow someone new or keep following someone we followed in beta If we stop now they wont know right Cant wait to see that my only follower is actually myself This might be one of those things that is particularly useful for the nsfw subs Just the other day I saw someone trying to figure out who would be follower x number so they could do something special for them As others have said this does open it up to make it more like some other social media platforms and the option for accounts to be sold is a bit concerning From the other side of the nsfw viewpoint maybe it would mean some users choose not to follow because they arent anonymous anymore Time will tell I love how Reddit is now just another Insta or Facebook without its staple anonymity one theme weve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you nbsp If there are other features youd like to see for profiles please let us know nbsp Who is asking for this WHO ARE YOU PEOPLEhttpsyoutubeGMMotwwRY Lol and now radio silence I dont think umjmayank was ready for the shitstorm Would you like boots or an umbrella sir Well you know what they say history does repeat itself Ive seen Reddit grow over the past  plus years Ive been on here while Digg dug its own grave simultaneously Just please dont turn into Digg or on that matter Facebook Twitter Instagram etc Dont shove a feature that not everyone may be pleased with down our throats I just wish for a feature to make your profile private Really tired of having to delete old comments just because some douchebags will dig through your post history and reply to you like Oh you like this and that Lol weirdo You guys will do everything but actually enforce rules about pictures being put up without permission or blatant racism I got suspended for using curse words with a mod but the sub that sarcastically took credit for the Jacksonville shooting even with people connected with victims relatives on Twitter still has shit like this up httpswwwredditcomrGamersRiseUpcommentsbrl Fuck the admins I still cant even figure out where to see if I have followers deleted How do I see if Ive followed anyone We Facebook now boys This profile and followers shit needs to die in a fucking fire I have a couple of questions  Is a follow the same thing as the add friend in the old Reddit  will third parties be able to see who I follow The announcement says that people cant see the full list but could someone other than me  the person I follow see for instance an extract Why cant we opt in to even allowing people to follow us Or less ideal opting out to the option of followers Or is that already possible Can we see you guys being more strict on subreddits that are known brigaders Why not give us an option to prevent people from following us in the first place Or perhaps make following somebody something you request and must be allowed by your target Remember that if youre not paying for a service youre not the user youre the product This is a blatant move for Reddit to better position its userbase for increased monetization Nobody is going to read this but I really dislike the whole follow culture and it was one of the reasons that I gravitated to Reddit in the first place I could do my thing and interact with different communities in relative anonymity Now I have people following me and it gives me the creeps Im assuming you guys are introducing this for monetary reasons but I know myself and lot of people feel that followculture is creepy and fundamentally unhealthy xB For the record Im not against changebut this is a bandwagonjumping negative one Ive been on Reddit for nearly  years but this is likely going to be a dealbreaker Let us make it so our post history and profiles arent public record FFS WTF Users can follow and possibly harass you on all your posts now How is this a feature No one asked for it Reddit needs to stop trying to be social media Wtf reddit That fucking sucked Protect me and my data pull your shit together Or how about making an option to make your profile activity hidden This would just solve the problem of people doxxing you Reddit is not a social media stop making it like one  Even Instagram and Twitter has private profile and Reddit The front page of the Internet doesnt Why There goes anonymity So was this implemented or Im trying to find the place where I can see who follows me how can someone see whos following him Is past august  yet there is no way to know If you let people follow you have to let the people being followed block them Otherwise you invite harassment You have to also allow people to automatically reject all followers This isnt some kind of surveillance state Thanks for the notice Ive noticed that certain people usually agitators seem to be able to block their user profile from being viewed Is this a bug or something a select few people are able to do BTW Thanks for half banning TD How can we view a list of who were following How about more administrator transparency Maybe you could explain why some subs only get quarantined for inciting violence thedonald while others are straight up erased for the same reasondefensedistributed and others are allowed to continue unaffected chapo While youre working on transparency could we PLEASE get an option to make our moderation logs public I dont care who follows me I do care how the feeds I consume are manipulated Reddit claims to support the Santa Clara Principles So please do sohttpswwwredditcomrblogcommentscwdwevestillgotyourbackerklm So users who have had about a year to follow me and downvote most of my stuff get to have a nice head start to unfollow me making it so that Ill never be able to see who they were The follow feature on Reddit was a joke enabling people to be anonymous jerks Make it fair and make it so the information is available now Itd be great if wed have the option to receive notifications for posts of users we follow when it is happening outside their profile page  many of you want more visibility when users follow you SurehttpsiimgurcomRsAzcrgif How about an ability to block specific people from following you How about more moderator visibility Who are these people running your site Hmm Not sure how I feel about reddit slowly becoming like other social media platforms im glad this changing but block all from following should also be a feature xB i say this knowing people can just rss feed your page I think I have two throwaway accounts I used like once or twice Cant even recall the usernames Cant imagine how many throwaways there are out there  if we get hacked the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little A after it So youre saying theres no way well be able to tell Sorry couldnt resist I dont quite get why abandoned throwaway accounts are a risk I mean even if these accounts get taken over by someone malicious so what The account has no historykarmareputation on reddit The account is forgotten by whoever created it so it cant be used to identifyattack that person I dont see what the hackerspammer would have to gain by doing this  wouldnt it be easier and just as effective for them to just create a brand new account On a related point a quick note about throwaways throwaway accounts are fine but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database Theyve never posted Theyve never voted They havent logged in for several years They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs because I generally dont want to think about though I do how many of them have the password hunter Shortly were going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and if we dont get a reaction in about a month were going to disable them Please keep an eye out Reddit should implement a built in way to abandon a comment Post something under your normal username and then remove your accounts relation to it but without actually deleting the account or the comment This would have the same effect as a throwaway in most cases unless a user is worried about reddit itselfthe government snooping on their post history except that it would require less effort on the users end just click a button instead of making a whole new account and it would reduce the security risk for reddit overall Well whoever gets my account can enjoy looking at all my downvoted shit posts and memes Reply to this comment with securityrelated horror stories suitable for rtalesfromtechsupport and we can crank up the fear mongering Should we trust security advice from someone named Keyser Sosa Thats the real question here While were on the topic of account security why isnt there a way to sort through your accounts comments from oldNew A lot of us who have old reddit accounts Im sure think about how young and stupid we were and how much personal information we posted about ourselves and would love to go and remove it but RES only loads a certain amount of comments and the default reddit UI tells me theres nothing new to be seen after about  years of comment history What is the best way you guys would suggest going back and erasing some of my comments without wiping put my whole account Reply to this comment with suggestions on good password managers and heuristics for making passwords Ill try to plug the good ones in an edit Reply to this comment to get a courtesy upron and also get me to the top for karma Unrelated my password strategy is just forget my password for every site and have to reset it when I get logged out Its working pretty well Oh what the hell theres an anomaly in my recent activity And my password is solid The description

accounts is for people with malicious intentions Ive seen spam but I would guess its a lot harder to find unused accounts and use them to spam than it is to trick the verification systemn when making new accounts Isnt it So this is almost entirely irrelevant but iftttcom not iffftcom Can you increase the detail on the account history page When I check it right now I can only see the last  hours which already shows that Ive logged in from the following  Comcast  Sprint PCS  ATT Wireless  My employer  Some other company that is also probably related to my employer Thats  different locations in the past  hours I dont know how much is tracked behind the scenes but even some kind of list of actions might be useful My account activity might not be typical Comcast is my home internet and between my tablet and phone I have Sprint and ATT  and then browsing while at work But if someone were to compromise my account and they happen to be on Sprint Comcast or ATT which is probably a huge population then I would never notice Can we see additional details Or maybe even any unusual actions or activities The information shown is not enough to make any reasonable determination of that How about increasing the length of time to a week  hours If the access is strictly via the reddit API can we see what app was performing that access How about what web browser or user agent If I exclusively use Chrome to access reddit I doat least when not using a mobile app and I see activity from someone using Safari or Firefoxthats not me and I know it Finally can we have any kind of alert generated for suspicious activity Even a system generated PM or email Ive had my own account this one shadow banned before and when I contacted the admin team I was told that it was because of suspicious activity I had no clue anything was going on until I contacted an admin  if it wasnt for a moderator kindly informing me that my post was shadow banned Id have never known Edit Actually the Some other company looks like a hosting provider for internet services My guess is one of the mobile reddit apps I use is using that company to host their push notification service This goes further to prove my point if I use a reddit app that happens to use a hosting company in Sweden for example because the developer is European based and the push notifications log into my account with permission from another countryas an end user Im being told that should freak me out Id go change my password and then feel safeuntil the next day when I see another login from this strange country You linked to Coding Horror OMG    Sounds like a WWII propaganda poster uKeyserSosa  the admin we all need and love Reading the xkcd comic linked I wonder what happened in march  googling that the first result is httpswwwexplainxkcdcomwikiindexphpPasswordReuse crazy  Adding FA to the login flow will require a lot of coordination Have you considered just saying Apps which are not using oath will no longer function if you enable this deleted What if I use a password manager and I have to log on to a machine that cant use the plugin How do I get hold of my password if that happened I see a lot of Amazoncom in my recent history Is this the regular reddit website A huge thank you from rfivenightsatfreddys Weve been dealing with this situation for days and have lost many Will the usernames be freed up from the dead accounts My dream is to adopt uthey then harvest all the karma from replying to thats what they said Is haveibeenpwnedcom still a good resource to check if youre affected by these leaks Lets see hmm if my reddit account is compromised can someone spend my money Nope Can I easily create a new account Yep Im just gonna keep using my same easyjunk password I use for every other financially insignificant website Check your own account activity page It would be nice if this could be a little more specific All other GeoIP lookup tools Ive seen can get it down to the city KeePasshttpkeepassinfo and KeePassXhttpswwwkeepassxorg we were just talking about KeePassX on rlinux in facthttpswwwredditcomrlinuxcommentskzvybmanagingpasswordsinlinuxwithkeepassx are awesome and keep you in complete control of your password database Can you please confirm that passwords are salted and hashed people actually steal reddit accounts I clicked on the enemy link and ir was directed to my account Freaked out I dont remember having been an enemy of reddit for the life of me Is this a joke or am I just one gullible bastard Mods need FA Mods need FA MODS NEED FA  But what about SRS Does this seriously mean mean LinkedIn was storing the plaintext passwords Isnt hash your users passwords the ass fundamental first rule of authentication Id like to start seeing people do jail time for mistakes like that Another vote for LastPass Pay the yr Go to httpyubicocom and buy a Yubikeyhttpswwwyubicocomproductsyubikeyhardware or use one of the many other  factor authentication methods they have The convenience of having all your passwords available from any connection and device outweighs the risk of a cloud based service Im so comfortable with LastPass that I heavily use the secure notes for things like passport numbers social security numbers etc and I use the credit card feature which has the added benefit of circumventing keyloggers Ive used Password and Passwordbox I still prefer LastPass Ultimately it doesnt matter which one you use Use a password manager and randomly generate all your passwords The thing that bothers me about blanket suggestions to just use a password manager is that for someone like me whose work computer us heavily locked down cant install any applications or browser extensions or even run any non approved applications I cant use password managers there What would my options be in this case Would it be possible to create FA as a opt in beta feature It can have a big disclaimer that it may not work for all apps and should only work if you use the website Or at least have the option for us to receive an email after every new sign in from a new IP address Maybe an email after X password attempts that someone has tried to log into your account For people with registered emails set up You never answer my questions to you so fuck your page Thanks for emphasizing this I know too many people who either forget their password and cant access their account because of it or had their account compromised because they made a password that was incredibly easy to guess Thanks for all the hard work you guys and gals do to keep this place running I know I have one throwaway that I dont want any more Is there a way to mark those accounts as throwaway and then delete them later on Would that be any easier to maintain Lets say for the sake of argument that I have a bunch of alts modding tiny subs and I dont log in to them very often If you disable these alts Ill lose access to both the alts and the tiny subs This sounds like a pretty big deal to me Hey everyone I saw this post and thought Id drop in I work for Password on the iOS team so let me know if you have any questions about password managers password security etc Not here to sell you anything just here to answer questions  uthrowthrowawaytime deleted So can I block all the admins and then plead ignorance in case of a ban But if I block users replying to me how am I going to win all of these online arguments are blocks really called enemies in the code thats hilarious Can I block admins Just for the sake of blocking admins Finally I can block this dickuserme How does this affect comments and posts being displayed to moderators If I block you can I still see your submissions in the subreddits that I moderate hopefully yes So this sounds like a sort of personal shadowban in effect They can message you tag you whatever and youll never see it Theyll be invisible Couple of questions well four  When I block someone will messages they sent me in the past disappear even if I replied  Can I unblock someone How can I unblock them if their profile is invisible to me If I unblock them will I suddenly see direct messages they sent me during the time they were blocked Edit I am now aware that I fail reading comprehension in asking the first part of question  If I cant see their comments will I therefore not see replies to their comments from others What if I have Reddit Gold and someone tags me  ujamesrc  in a reply to one of their comments Any notification  Say the user submits a link and someone sends me a direct link to the discussion thread  do I just get a  That is all So is this essentially like a shadow ban for the abusive user from yourself Since they dont know anything is different but you personally cant see their posts at all so uwarlizard is going to block everyone Im far more concerned that usporkicide doesnt know how to spell hamster deleted I blocked gallowbob and now the front page is blank Great now can you fix the search feature I didnt even know avocados or change my view existed neat jokes on you and your wasted time implementing this feature I never get PMs Im a bit disappointed Keyser You missed an absolute perfect reference Just block the user andhttpsyoutubeVtmkAFbOs If enough people block the same person will it notify you guys to look into said user Cause thatd be interesting if it did Have you considered adding the ability to add blocks on that prefs page I wondered why you hadnt been replying to my messages Blocked Dont talk to me or my son ever again Next I think we should add sitewide spoiler tags for Reddit This is a great enhancement to Reddit I cant wait to block all those people calling me a troll and spambot I just want to tell everyone about hot nudes in PROXY Have to delete my account because I angered Monica Lewinsky fans Too angry for me Damn finally Now when can we block whole subreddits from all Can you reply to this so I can be the first to block an admin Aww thanks for the shoutout  My quest to make rcats a default continues to this day Sure it lacks quality pictures or any other cats besides my own but at least theres a lot of content Does apply to users already blocked Edit It does I went and checked my favourite blocked troll and got thishttpiimgurcomABXYcypng Is there any risk of abuse How does this affect mod actions on the user such as mod mails from the sub from that user regular mod mail started by the blocked mod or ban messages sent on behalf the mod postcomment removal distinguished replies  EDIT I did some testing TLDR is if a user blocks you as a mod they dont get any inbox notices for either comment replies or mod mail from you the mod So be careful removing something of their and being accused of not notifying them if

manager Were they going to be announced When is the aboutteam page going to be up and running again Does it work similarly to covering your ears and going la la la la la Will it eventually be possible to block someone who has never messaged you or replied to your comment before Does this work on Alien Blue I browse mostly via the app Now everyone can think they got the last word Just wanna way that

playlistsrradditplaylists  plugins that interferemku  RIP uVideoLinkBot Seems like a good idea for anyone posting to rgonewild and similar subreddits Is there a way to select a user  who hasnt messagedcommented in reply to you and block them  through their user name alone Luckily Ive no reason to block anybody yet since nobodys thrown abuse in my inbox Hopefully I wont end up having to use it The only reason I come to reddit is to insult people and berate other users Im very unhappy in my own life so I try to drag others down to make mine not seem so bad Have you given any consideration to how these changes affect users like myself This will effectively remove a significant portion of your user base from all participation without their knowledge or consent Am I seriously the only one that realizes how fucked up this is Make a Block Bernie button Reddit is near unusable with the amount of garbage Bernie posts This can be useful to ignore the habitual trolls Nice you can now shadowban people from your reddit life Why not add a button to report PMs as well deleted sohow do you block someone that has not made contact to you other then shitty spam to me posts ex autotldr botIve been wanting to block this thing for SOOOOO longbut there is no options for it anywhere Do i need to get the bot to reply to me or something edit spa  spam Why cant we block a users submitted posts Im tried of obvious reposters digging for karma and turning reddit into the same stuff week after week Finally salty users can right out block me and make their experience better Thank you admins This is great Thank you for adding this feature I true My appreciate it What about harassment posts THAT ARE NOT IN YOUR MAILBOX Fuck guys Ive contacted you about this repeatedly and youve said nothing Now Im airing this out like fucking dirty laundry I want blocked users to know theyve been blocked That way they dont have the satisfaction of thinking their comments are being read Very nice and a major improvement over the old blocking feature Thanks If I block a user will he also not see my posts Okay so if I block them their stuff is hidden from me But if they have a grudge out against me how do I hide my stuff from them I wont be able to see what hate theyre spewing out but the other people around that post can so it would still be doing damage to me But if I were able to hide my content from them they wouldnt even know there was a post to go piss on This is awesome thank you so much Will there be a filter topic option rolling out soon Its such a useful RES feature Thats great Ive had a guy stalk me for a little while and it was actually unnerving he actually messaged me again after the Brussels attack to say how he was glad it happened and how we deserved it to a degree that I didnt expect So I was wondering is there actually any feasible way to outright block the person As in alt accounts and all I suppose that would only work given a fixed IP address How will this affect child comments of a blocked user Thank you Good stuff TIL I have a mailbox in reddit Finally Ive wanted this feature forever Thank god  fuck u About time Hey  Ive posted an idea to rideasfortheadmins but it didnt get much attention Basic idea is to stop trolls from pming spoilers about new media releases Does this help with that If not can you Would be cool if users with low karmaNew accounts couldnt pm other users That or if we could have filters to help prevent that So am I able to finally block gallowboob so I dont have to see desperate reposting karma whoring Would this make it possible to compile lists of every user in subreddits that a person finds problematic and then block them all in  go Because thats where I see this going OMG INNOVATION This is such a blessing Does this ban work permanently What if they later change themselves and be a better person My heart just cant take this much responsibility  Hopefully this is one of those things that the vast majority of people on this site never need to use Its kind of funny when I use RES and see that the guy Im upvoting is the same person Ive down voted like  or  times on completely different topics It create this ecosystem built around topics and actual ideas rather than the people I kind of like that Please remember why the current reddit site is the way it is It is functional not pretty If making it look good comes at thr expense of making the site more difficult to navigate do not do it Please dont make the rewrite of the desktop site result in a Digg  fiasco How can reddit avoid the same fate as Digg after their desktop site update Can you please do something like a save place for rall on the iOS app Its quite annoying when youre deep into rall and your thumb accidentally swipes back to search and you lose your place Other than that great work on the app It really made me use Reddit a ton more and we all know thats a good thing Thank you How long till this years first reddit admin scandal Id like an ETA so I have snacks ready pls respond Why did the mobile sites functionality suddenly invade my iPad I was very happy with browsing Reddit with the desktop site on here but now I get the mobile site which I hate How can I go back to the desktop site EDIT Looks like this was a bug and the admins have fixed it Yay New website I feel like the current Reddit UI is so iconic I dont even know how else Id picutre it deleted Im liking the increase of these whats happening announcement posts Keep up the great work  of views from apps is surprising to me Might have to check them out Also first time hearing of this rework I think a lot of reddits charm is the relative plainness of the website although I dont know enough about code to tell how the backend works Is this a functional change visual rework or just a complete overhaul of everything For the desktop site can you just buy and integrate RES thats really all we need Could you share the stats on image hosting Id be really interested to see how Reddits own platform has taken over imgur in a relatively short time frame Keep up the great work Can we get sort by rising in the iOS app I need to view Reddit in as many different ways possible during my work bathroom trips  the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit If you havent given them a try yet you should definitely take them for a spin Not to be a bad egg but its actually really difficult to use compared to Reddit is Fun Thats why even before you guys shut down the function to view Reddit on a mobile browser I used a mobile browser because the app doesnt function correctly anyway I just would rather have the website on my phone than app version just maybe easier to click buttons and read stuff  One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website It is a long time coming The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years it is not particularly welcoming to new users or old for that matter For this possible huge update do you think you could maybe for people that arent used to coding websites give them guidelines when creating their own subreddits Like basic things like formatting pictures and editing the theme One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website it is not particularly welcoming to new users or old for that matter gulp A rewrite of the desktop site is scary Why Because the new apps and new mobile design are all wrong They are pushing design over functionality Weve lost so much functionality including most mod tools in the new designs as well as speed The new mobile site is just so slowhttpsyoutubeXXPZigLXuE The new modmail is much slower than the original as well The devs are open to feedback as weve seen but clearly the end product is how we have it today Bulky Slow Lacking features For example in the mobile app there is no way to view subreddit rules You have no idea how frustrated I am as a moderator to hear this You say  are using the new app this means  of reddit dont know about subreddit rules and this just forces the quality of a community to spiral downwards and increases workload on mods Functionality and responsiveness needs to come first ahead of design Also dont fix what isnt broken Ive already signed up to your link but I generally feel like the devs just dont listen httpswwwredditcomrredditmobilecommentsfyuoasamoderatortheappismissingafewcritical  months ago Ive been using reddit desktop for  years now Its quick Its responsive I guess this is going to change Let me request this Keep an option for the original design forever We need it deleted Why am I being forced to use the mobile site on my tablet Even if i select desktop site whenever I click home or back to the front page I get directed back onto the mobile site Do not like this Please stop trying to force me onto a mobile app especially when Im on a tablet You say youre proud of the mobile apps but on Android the app is pretty worthless with comments never loading in for the most part and using the mobile site is pretty dreadful as well  Do you guys check out rideasfortheadmins There are quite a few great ideas that you could choose from there to introduce to reddit  What is the process to get subs that blatantly violate reddits involuntary pornography ruleshttpsredditzendeskcomhcenusarticlesWhatisinvoluntarypornographyandglorificationofsexualviolence banned or atleast have an admin look at them  I wish the rcommunitydialogue project gets started again There are quite a lot of things moderators wish to discuss with the admins like uachievementunlockd I hope youre able to allocate more resources to this subreddit Two particular areas of concern for me anyway is how to deal with spam that is not caught by the spambot at rspam and how to better deal with ban evaders  Why do admins mod hate subs like ronionhate They ban innocent users from rOnionLovers  Can we have better traffic stats for subreddits The existing stats exclude mobile traffic and are not very indepth When you roll out the new UI will you implement a classic or legacy option for those that will end up preferring old the one I refuse to use the official Reddit app because I hate the UI and its missing like half the sites functionality but absolutely love RiF because you can make it look and behave pretty much identical to desktop I happen to like the desktop version and use it on my Android tablet because it is both personally aesthetically pleasing and easier on my eyes Currently without any warning or recourse Im having links going to the mobile version although there is no m in the address to indicate it If Ive set my options to desktop can it please be consistently applied I wont touch the app until its at full desktop functionality including seeing the sidebars As somebody who still sticks with desktop even on mobile how are you planning on changing it please dont mess it up Edit Shit Now mobile site is forcedhttpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsokzbiredditchangeredirectingmredditcomto even when you choose desktop site making users need to request desktop through the site every time it is opened I stuck with it through all the fatpeoplehateEllen Pao debacles but forcing that awful interface will definitely make me seek alternatives As you have probably noticed theres a pretty good split between people who like the desktop site now as is and people who want shiny shit Do us all a favor and include a legacy option Even if this requires recreating the front end with the new design lots of us prefer the minimalist style of today Making an effort to replicate that in any form would be very nice even if it isnt the default deleted Spez do you think the world is doomed How can I prepare for the impending disasters Should I buy gold drama free lol How big a problem is ban evasion Every time Ive messaged the adminshttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetoFrFredditcomsubjectBanEvasion about a suspected case its always been quickly resolved but Im curious whether its whackamole or if the AntiEvil team is building a robot army to automatically eradicate it as part of their  OKRs Edit since all the replies except spez appear to have misread my comment Im asking about ban evasion not ban abuse As in people who get banned and then immediately make a new sockpuppet to continue their trolling Hey Steve I wanted to ask if the name is Reddit now with a capitalized R Is the word spelt Subreddit or SubReddit Anyway heres to a drama free  I hear youre preparing for the apocalypsehttpwwwnewyorkercommagazinedoomsdayprepforthesuperrich But what about Reddit What are your plans to make sure Reddit stays up and running during these next  years What do you guys think of the mods that use a bot to detect when a user posts on a sub they dont like and then bans them from their own sub when most of the time that user hasnt broken any rules in their sub or even participated in it deleted Ive seen a rise in doxxing and witch hunting on this site Any plans to address that So we know the Geek Squad gets  working as FBI Informants WHAT ARE YOU GETTING SPAZ This keeps falling on deaf ears but Im going to try again Please PLEASE Fix the official Reddit app on iOS When you post quotes greater than sign it shows up with the  gt line instead of quoting appropriately You edit your comment save and it looks fine Similarly backslashes always show up So backslash at the beginning of the line doesnt just show a  it shows a backslash and the hash mark Alien Blue displayed all of this properly years before your app came out yet the inhouse app cant do it correctly Come on Great summary Its amazing all these things happened this year It feels like longer On the mobile apps side maybe you can help address a few outstanding issues that seem to be getting ignored  We dont have mod tools but I cant for the life of me figure out why the share menus dont have an option to open a post or comment into the browser Not only are all the mod actions available there already opening in a browser is so helpful in other ways too Ever see someone say sorry cant do that cause Im on mobile I feel most of that stems from being locked in one place on the app If you could open a browser tab you can go find what you need and easily return where you were to continue the conversation  Formatting issues since day one have never been fixed Reddit markdown shows things like  and  nbsp etc at least on the iPhone version This is especially concerning because users assume its the author or the sub who messed it up when its a problem on the app they use  Links dont work correctly I pointed out a bughttpswwwredditcomrredditmobilecommentsitllinkstothewikiwithoutthefullurldontload where shorthand links like r dont load or even crash the Android version and as far I know nobody even looked at it Also shortlinks like httpsreddit load in a popup browser where the user isnt logged in and cant participate Again this reflects badly on the author or sub because the mobile user just thinks were giving them bad links  When users report a post or comment the default selection is about threatening or harassing It took us a while to figure out why we were getting so many false reports about it Also they dont even display the subdefined report reasons from aboutrules The latter is understandable because theres lots to do but the former just sounds like it causes confusion for everyone Thanks   the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit Im pretty sure RedditIsFun and RES users beg to differ  One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website Not again Please Every time you guys fuck with website it makes the experience worse This is by no means an exhaustive list  First it was removing vote counters that let people know controversial a comment or post actually was  Then it was changing the hotness algorithm thats causing  hour old posts to still be on the frontpage or first few pages  Then it was the decaying hotness algorithm that made way more NSFW content show up on rall  After that it was optout link tracking and paid ads masquerading as legitimate posts Where does it end uspez Whatever you do please allow for reddit classic on the desktop website after you change itunless its really similar that is Been using this site for damn near  years now and I like the design how it is now I turn off all CSS and I just really like the default view with nightmode on  In the wake of Spezgiving we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times uspez did you lose ability to modify the database after Spezgiving It seemed strange for a CEO to have that access but you mentioned it was a holdover from your prior stint which makes sense Given your current role no longer requires it as well as what you described yourself as a abuse of that access is there a reason for you to retain it Why am I suddenly forced to use the god awful mobile version all of a sudden It was fine a couple minutes ago It might be more conveniant for just browsing the front page but its garbage for managing your messanges etc Now its just as bad as the fucking app Well at least its not as slow as the shitty app that wont even load comments most of the time The admins of Reddit did a great job of pushing out updates in  that benefit the community Thanks for the hard work you guys have put in and thanks for listening to the feedback and suggestions many of us have given you What does the AntiEvil and Trust  Safety teams do Hey admins its been an eventful and rocky year but we came out okay So thanks for keeping us afloat Will you guys work more on the imagegif hosting side of reddit For example some gifs are so raw that it takes forever to download And the urls oh god they go on for miles There is a bizarre number of appreciative responses in this thread despite the increasing issues with the site When will Reddit take an official stance or at least recognize the issue of government be it domestic or foreign and corporate astroturfing I understand the sophisticated nature of these programs and I understand how difficult it is to actually do something about this problem but there are things Reddit can do to at least highlight the problem and create official tips on what to watch for A rBitcoin user created a wonderful step by step sheet that provided a list of behaviours and activities to be aware of which was extremely useful if someone could remember where it was that would be awesome The risk is creating a witch hunt but at least making an official recognition of the problem even saying Yes we recognize its a problem is better than utterly ignoring it It represents not only a threat to the front page of the internet but it presents a threat to constructive free discourse online Why has my iPad reset to this disgusting version of reddit I would like to use the desktop version but it keeps setting on something else and I cant stop it resetting Every time I click on the reddit icon it goes to the beta or mobile version its horrible The mobile version is bad enough on my phone that you cant go back the the thread you posted on directly you can only look at the context Please stop doing this and forcing people to change Edit its fine now D I have a question to the Reddit team Did you update the site so that mobile users such as those on iPad are forced onto the Mobile Website Because I was off reddit for three hours and when I came back and went onto reddit everything was mobiley Should the definition of brigading also include actions to deliberately influence rall The subreddits rOverwatch and rCompetitiveOverwatch have a great way to minimize comments Instead of a  and  the whole left edge is a bar that you can click to minimize or expand comments Its fantastic especially when I view Reddit in desktop view on my phone Can we make that sitewide Its intuitive looks classy is easy to use and makes the site more friendly to people with poor motor control or with tiny screens Do you have any examples of the new Desktop UI that youd like to show off This could be really exciting I find myself redditing on my phone more because of the beauty of the apps that I use  comments so I guess nobody will ever see this But just in case you are there uspez please can you remove the limits of how many subreddits you can exclude from rall I use this feature to remove porn subreddits but very quickly I reached the limit All of these made it to my rall at some point in the past few weeks and I blocked them but now there are more porn subreddits appearing and it wont

all NSFW content because most of it is fine  I dont care if someone swears or is wearing a bikini But obviously I dont want to be looking at a big cock in a womans ass at work And also I dont want to look at porn all the time anyway If Im not masturbating I dont want to see it even if Im at home browing reddit alone But porn seems to show up on rall more than anything else more than rTheDonald ever did and its spread between hundreds of subreddits Whats the point of the filter then Cant we make porn subreddits tagged as such and exclude them but separately from NSFW which is a very loose term and used far too sensitively There needs to be more finegrained control rall has so much porn Less spam is always appreciated Even less spam would be more appreciated Why is raltright not quarantined at minimum They are a racist neonazi forum that constantly posts hatespeech harrassment calls to violence witchhunts and doxxing campaigns This seems to fall under the basic guidelines as laid out that should at minimum qualify the sub for quarantining Just yesterday they had a post at the top of their page crowdfunding a doxxing campaign httpsnpredditcomraltrightcommentspkwfexposetheantifawhosuckerpunchedrichard Why is raltright not quarantined if not outright banned So what are the chances youll be able to define brigading for us or perhaps give moderators tools for identifying it Dont drastically change the desktop experience guys Despite being not particularly welcoming to new users its still allowed this website to become wildly popular If I fire this site up one day and it looks like Tumblr I will be inconsolable deleted Thank you for the spam fixes those were so annoying on every sub If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear itd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger What about the people in rphotoplunder What about rbeatingwomen Thousands of pictures of women amongst other things are leaked and posted everyday on this site and the only reason they are not banned and removed is because they dont have the bank accounts to take legal action Edit Obligatory thanks for gold stranger I think most of us understand why rthefappening was taken down from a legal standpoint But its just a weak argument to involve sentiment when there are a multitude of subreddits with deplorable content that dwarfs stolen pics of nude celebs Sodoes that mean youre going to make age verification a requirement on rGonewild ualienth I appreciated your post much more than the Blog post which smacked of doublespeak given that it did not directly address the banned subreddits it even seemed to suggest that they werent banned for the reasons cited The reasons which you have provided are in my mind understandable and possibly even sensible Fair enough However I would like to ask one thing Please provide a timely public log or an automated subreddit which lists all subreddits have been banned and a detailed clear maybe even thoughtful explanation as to why they were banned The mass confusion over why these particular subreddits were banned shouldnt be repeated And if Reddit is truly to be a platform thats open in any way it needs transparency when heavy handed actions such as these are taken I dont want to be part of a community where community voices are silenced without meaningful notice or explanation No one really does like that secret police feeling The blog post certainly was not meaningful in regard to providing meaningful notice nor explanation I agree that free speech has limits but the prosecution of those limits needs to be public in order that it not be seen as simply a higher level of manipulation of the discourse that occurs on this site As for you get some rest its Sunday Just gonna say this The less transparent moderators become on Reddit the sooner people will flock to an alternative Nothing lasts forever on the internet This was a much better message than the blog post  Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response and made that known in various ways  This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didnt sit well with me personally to say the least We hit new traffic milestones ones which Id be ashamed to share publicly  Still in the moment seeing what we were seeing happen it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint  You guys have an identity problem here You want Reddit to be a particular sort of site but you arent willing to make it that site Wanting it and wishing for it isnt going to make you any happier when it isnt Fundamentally you and other folks at Reddit are saddled with being admins for a site that bothers you on a regular basis Do you really think that wont affect your enthusiasm for the job or for the site You say  we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible But why There would be a lot of difficult problems to solve if you were to change your policy what topics should be banned what are the rules and guidelines and conditions but so far that discussion if youve had it internally hasnt been made public No reason has been given for Reddit has to be as free as chan And the thing is if you were happier with Reddit because it was that free then that would be a sufficient enough reason But youre not rthefappening was tremendously popular It wasnt just a minor portion of your userbase So in your position I dont think I could say Well it was just a few bad apples I really do like most of what the site is about Reddit has had this problem for years It tries to attract really nice people into administrative jobs presenting Reddit as a place for giftsharing and donations and political change while simultaneously saddling them with a community full of a lot of really nasty content and then tying their hands to do anything about it Thats where the blog post really really fell flat it was a lecture written for an audience that you dont have At some point youve really gotta decide what kind of site you want to be If its going to continue to be completely handsoff with rare exceptions then youve gotta decide whether thats the kind of site you want to be responsible for and I dont want to be too much of a hypocrite here so Ill confess I totally followed that subreddit A lot Im not sad that its gone but the blog post didnt make me reexamine my life choices either Were not confused were pissed Reddit has tolerated the most base and vile sorts of racism sexism religious bigotry posts about selfharm posts about bestiality posts admitting to crimes and even leaked nudes of normal people deflecting criticism of them with we dont censor Which is only a meaningful defense as long as you hold to it absolutely Now the people in the pictures have money and access to the noninternet media and lo and behold suddenly there are rules Your post came across as very sincere and convinced me that you dont actually know why you banned the subreddit So let me simplify things here Position  Were banning the subreddit because of DMCA requestslegal issues for which reddit can be held liable  Nope Turn off thumbnails and youre Aok Position  Were banning the subreddit because of the insane amount of work involved in managing it  Nope Turn off thumbnails autodirect DMCA takedown notices to imgurwherever and put your feet up Position  Were banning the subreddit because of the morally questionable content  Nope as others have stated theres much worse out there Position  Were banning the subreddit because we want reddit to have a certain image in the public This subreddit and its popularity are damaging that image   Edit formatting I think you should have just said simply We had to remove thefappening and related subreddits due to DMCAsillegal content and spam and called it a day instead of the whole we love free speach we will never interfere with subreddits Oh and btw were banning bunch of subreddits that have nude celebrity pictures which caused a lot of confusion and angry responses As far as the funds goes I think someone calculated in that thread that its only like  refund the money and let the users keep gold is probably the best way to avoid being attacked by either side and the sum isnt that big and I doubt it will really have impact on reddit as whole Plus you might get some people interested in repurchasing reddit gold once it expires Thats what Id do anyway What makes this rphotoplunder any different than rTheFappening other then they arent famous  we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible Then why did you ban a blackladies mod If youre keeping hands off then why are you banning individual users that do things like call out the admins for refusing to help them deal with people brigading their subs and posting dead mutilated black children Is it because she was gaining traction with online news sources picking up her story If your policy is hands off why does that not extend to users like uDualPollux and Swore Why are the admins picking and choosing who to target Why does Unidan get to create a new account that he publicly links to his old account but when users that point out racism and bigotry on this site do the same thing their new accounts are immediately banned It takes legal action for you to get involved and remove stolen pictures from reddit but youre more than willing to swoop in and get your hands dirty to ban people who say Hey theres racism and people admitting to rape then giving out the victims username on reddit If you want to be hands off be hands off But be consistent Dont say we stay neutral when the site is in uproar over stolen pictures then ban a blackladies mod by saying shes interfering with the culture of specific subreddits What interfered with the culture more TheFappening or uDualPollux And I dont mean you specifically I mean you the admins deleted  The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit We would takedown images thumbnails in response to those DMCAs but it quickly devolved into a game of whackamole Wed execute a takedown someone would adjust reupload and then repeat Im not sure I understand this part So reddit was liable to DMCAs because it was hosting the thumbnail image of the copyrighted pictures Couldnt you just disable thumbnails for rthefappening or something Im not an expert but it seems like that would be fairly easy and would remove any chance of reddit hosting copyrighted images i can see the mexican cartel butcher someone with a chainsaw but the moment some famous twats twat shows up on here a very sad thing has happened Well since we have you here can you finally shed some light on the mass shadowbannings and censoring of a large amount of the Zoe Quinn content Content that broke no rules The Fappening happened right on that events heels and really made everybody forget all about it Id still like an explanation and for the mods admins at fault to be held accountable EDIT Ive gotten a response from uSporkicide which can be found herehttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfpdaxtimetotalkckboax and ualienth has responded separately to the same issue found herehttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfpdaxtimetotalkckbhia deleted deleted So how many women in rphotoplunder need to hire lawyers to get you to actually have standards for them because the header for that sub is literally they should know better Also should the families of the rpicturesofdeadkids lawyer up too because it seems your only standard is free speech above all else unless it makes bad press for us then we were always at war with Eurasia You obviously did this to comply with legal requirements so why are you hamming up your reasons with all this deplorable act of flagrant privacy violation language That makes you sound like CNN and it certainly adds to the misconception that you are kissing celebrity ass I believe what you are saying but it would be much more persuasive without all the rhetorically charged language Especially since violations of privacy occur on Reddit all the time Remember the woman with the facial hair What about the people who get posted in subreddits like rcringepics A lot of what people find so irritating about this situation is the whole idea of celebrities somehow having ascended untouchable status and that actions that affect them are more of an outrage than ones that affect ordinary people Your fingerwagging at the people who leaked these photos makes it seem like you dont understand that or arent sympathetic to it  Q Why arent you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content   A We remove what were required to remove by law and what violates any rules which we have set forth Beyond that we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them I believe the blog post speaks very well to this  We have banned rTheFappening and related subreddits for reasons I outlined above Every second a sub like httpwwwredditcomrphotoplunder is up after this youre basically saying that unless a person has enough money to hire an attorney or is savvy enough to create a DMCA take down or find your DMCA procedure to make you do work their stolen nude pictures are fair game The victims might not even be aware of them Thats reprehensible Particularly given the tenor of that blog post and your comment about being shocked if it were your own family member I dont know why you edited that part about family out Q You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits Give it back  Give it to charity A This is a tricky issue one which we havent figured out yet and that Id welcome input on You could always follow the suit of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and return the money generated from someone elses stolen images and likeness used for commercial gain Im somewhat amazed an enterprising attorney hasnt hopped on that tort claim yet for one of these celebrities  Quick edit  because I sound mean and am not intending to come across that way  I think this is a good opportunity for the admins to prevent the victimization of people online and they should seize that chance Okay if you are pissed off at what reddit is doing stop giving gold Lets make sure that the daily gold bar stays below  You guys are cool with leaving up subs like rrapingwomen to preserve free speech Fuck you Please post all the DMCA requests which surely are not confidential That way we can better understand your actions Stop with the embarrassing dad titles  we dont need to talk you need to stop pretending you are some kind of moral pariah when you are just cowering to lawyers Hey I got a question Why are all my replies to this thread being deleted Ill try a third time because there was absolutely nothing rulebreaking in the post  Yall really need to drop the grandstanding and euphemisms Heres the thing Youve got your neckbearded Voltaire mask complete with the clown nose and everything Sir I detest what you say but I would die for your right to wakka wakka honk honk Its a fun prop You can either keep it on or you can take it off but you gotta choose bucko If you decide to pick and choose on an improvisational basis depending on when its convenient for site revenues then expect to rightly be called a bunch of fucking hypocrites You have stood firmly behind the assorted sewer spawn of reactionaries and bigots who made this site their home and command post Whole place is infested with them and nobody wants to take out the trash Its being overrun by a stampede of gutterdwelling white supremacists and misogynists harassing marginalized groups here in droves Communities and mods have been practically begging youhttpwwwredditcomrblackladiescommentsejgbwehavearacistuserproblemandredditwont for years to at least let them filter out brigades of white supremacists without putting their forums on lockdown Instead you ban the peoplehttpnpredditcomrSubredditDramacommentseojvnmoderatorofrblackladiesshadowbannedbutwhyckfsq rocking the boat by pointing out the hypocrisy and then you make proud statements about how reddit in its uncompromising bravery and liberal wisdom must give the lynch mobs a platform a podium and a megaphone all funded by the users who have to be subjected to it So when thread after racebaiting thread on forums with millions of subscribers is filled to the gills with thousands of racist fuckwits sermonizing how they should lynch all the chimps and management stands by proudly nodding at all this free speech its fostering dont bother turning around to scream unconscionable moral outrage at a Hollywood sex tape While current US law does not prohibit linking to stolen materials we deplore the theft of these images and we do not condone their widespread distribution  uyishan The obvious conclusion here is that you decided to deny a platform to people invading the privacy of celebrities who might soon change their minds about promoting your company Good times Should have been done right away in my opinion Now for the other matter Why do far worse and far more deplorable offenders deserve that same platform without eliciting your indignation What is the criteria for expression deserving that indignation by the way Perhaps like the CEO sayshttpnpredditcomrTheoryOfRedditcommentshefwqwhatimpactonredditwillbanningtheracistcaunpc people of color should just fork over some more money to be considered Clown nose on or clown nose off Pick one  Metapattern recognition Reddits actual policy is as plainly derived from its actions rather than its words  We believe in and support free speech until such a point as we determine that said participation in certain kinds of sociallydisaprovedspeech will be harmful to Reddit as a whole That we shut down as soon as we recognize the damage  End of my view of what Reddits MetaPattern is regarding free speech What It Means The US Bill of Rights obligates ONLY Governmental entities towns schools etc to not interfere with the speech of others Private entities have no obligation to provide free speech to others As an internet user since  and a fan of the US Bill of Rights I recognize that free speech is a good thing and that Reddit as a private entity is not obligated by the US Bill of Rights to provide anyone with any free speech Regardless I am grateful to Reddit for the extent that they do support a free speech platform for the world and I further want them to continue to do so so I regard their actions taken to protect their platform as reasonable and necessary for Reddits long term continuation Some speech is much more important than other speech Jonathan Aaron Schwartz comes to mind Victims of violence all over the world come to mind nude pics of celebs not so much In memory and respect to all victims who have been silenced everywhere Let the rest of us raise our voices to speak for them Edit had name wrong I think were missing something obvious here Why have the you should all be ashamed of yourselves Reddit is a moral website blog post followed by this lets be frank and honest stuff Because they are made for separate audiences The blog post is now repeated almost word for word in that Business Insider article and makes Reddit look Good to the outside world after a week of negative press This post is to keep us happy Heres why Im angry Youre doing the exact same thing you do every time theres bad press Deal with it at the last possible moment like rjailbait once theres bad press forcing you to do so Then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it doesnt set a precedent It is identical to what always happens Here is the blog posthttpwwwredditcomrblogcommentspmjfanecessarychangeinpolicy from when you banned rjailbait Note the exact same thing Weve decided that its time for a change that happens to coincide with Anderson Cooper doing a story about it on CNNhttpenwikipediaorgwikiControversialRedditcommunitiesFrFjailbait To be clear I understand why youre doing it I understand that a lot of companies do the same which is totally fine Just dont then make a blog post about how wonderful free speech is If the blog post said We actually wanted to keep allowing them but got too many notices from lawyers for that to work so we had to ban them that would be fine by me The doublepseak and hypocrisy is whats annoying me You cant take the moral highground on this when youve let rphotoplunder stay open for however long it has This is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes If you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs of course people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities It would be impossible for that to not seem capricious If you allow subreddits like rniggers of course theyre going to be assholes who gang up to brigade The fine users of rjailbait are sharing kiddy porn What a shocking revelation The point is you cant let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall Stand up for standards for a change Actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be Youll piss off some people but who cares Theyre the shitty people you dont want anyway Instead youre just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls deleted  deleted For TLDR We censored because Wall of Text Q Will we censor again A Yes if pressure comes we censor We even accept taking DMCAs on user generated weblinks aka zero content on our host Youre exhausted and stressed and PR is not your job Close your computer go home sleep and hire a legit public and legislative affairs person tomorrow morning For real Oh yes time to talkBUT DELETE EVERYONE MENTIONING YOUR BLATANT CENSORING Have you checked out this httpsimgurcomafWDf Basically during the GamingJournalism Reddit Admins participated in heavy censoring and lying But hey Free Speech Here is the related redditthread httpwwwredditcomrKotakuInActioncommentsfdcmcensorshiponredditshadowbanninganddrama Funny how all the censoring resulted in a fullon Streisand effect There is an example TODAY of mods in rgames banning and shadowbanning users for posting about the story about racketerring of the IGF awards Please tell me that something will be done about the mod abuse across the subreddits Im not angry Im dissapointed So it is still perfectly acceptable to post pictures of dead kids and execution videos along with stolen content from Joe Publics phone Just checking edit  I just got back from work and I was unprepared for what I come home to thanks for the gold strangers I just wish it was for something that was less controversial like a picture of cute hamsters or something nice like that If you feel necessary to maintain a neutral platform why did the Zoe Quinn stuff happen Since we are talking DMCA can someone help me out here and explain why Reddit was removing links to the infringing content DMCA notices are a removing content from THEIR website as in Reddit was actually posting the infringing image andor b if the websites entire existence was to circumvent copyright protections on software or materials that have copyright protections in place DVD software whathaveyou DMCA does not specifically prevent a website from linking to illegalinfringing content nor is there case law that requires you to remove links to infringing content like copy written images Reddit doesnt host images or does it If no no reason to take down the link The only thing I can think of is the thumbnail that goes with the link and if that is the case you remove the image and not the link Reddits sole purpose isnt to circumvent copyright protections on materials that have copyright so no take down So yeah not buying the DMCA line either I understand all that but the fact that rPicsOfDeadKids rCuteFemaleCorpses and all the other fucked up subs around this place just makes it feel like you only ban things when it hurts your image or bottom line I get that your a business and thats what you need to do but stop trying to make it about something else Stolen images get posted here daily as well as images taken without consent and images of really fucked up things But it takes celebrity nudes before you start doing anything In the grand scheme of things we should remember how fundamentally unimportant this is and react accordingly We know you have to follow the DMCA and dont want to piss off a bunch of celebrity agents The issue is dressing it up like youre doing some big public service Bottom line It was easier for you so you did it Also this is a speech There is nothing to talk about you made your point It would be better if you just did what wubwub said I think you should have just said simply We had to remove thefappening and related subreddits due to DMCAsillegal content and spam and called it a day instead of the whole we love free speach we will never interfere with subreddits So you managed to turn a longwinded pandering statement into an even longerwinded pandering statement Well done And you failed to address the primary issue of hypocrisy You cant take the moral high ground when subreddits dedicated to stolen images like rphotoplunder exist and thrive Complete with the they should know better victimblaming tagline I think im going to ask people on AMAs about there stance and belief of reddit hosting rPicsOfDeadKids rCuteFemaleCorpses from now on deleted I am torn One the one hand I do not envy your position yet at the same time it is obvious that this has all been handled just as poorly as possible So it really just comes down to just not being able to maintain complying with the DMCAs All morality aside this was a business move since Reddit does not have the resources to maintain complying with the law for these subreddits It makes sense and it could have been explicitly expressed that way Obviously the chaos and timesensitivity caused this to morph into a bunch of different reasons and theories None of this applies to private reddits You can make a group here to exchange any information at all and nobodys going to notice or care So what people here are complaining about isnt really their right to communicate freely with their own associates theyre complaining about what they cant say to strangers without even getting their permission first Its not really about your right to disseminate information its about what you cant shove in someones face when you dont even know them or have any prior relationship with them There is some freedom we have and ought to have to loudly say uninvited things to strangers in public places but we really shouldnt confuse that with our more basic freedoms of expression and association which are in no danger at all from these policies Gold was purchased by our users to give to other users Great Purchasers should get what they paid for and the intended parties should keep their gold What reddit does with the profit though is completely up to reddit and out of the hands of the purchasers Do something good with that money Do the right thing So what was up with the Zoe Quinn thing I dont recall any rules being broken yet people went out of there way to kill any form of discussion about the topic I dont understand how you guys keep bragging about free speech yet you nuke threads that didnt even break any rules Also as an aside my main job at reddit is systems administration I take care of the servers that run the site It isnt my job to interact with the community but I try to do what I can Can you please let us know whos job it is to interact with the community ITT People are confused that Reddit is a business and will do as little as possible to make as much money as possible while avoiding as much trouble as possible Why are people gilding admins They already have access to everything Youre just throwing money at reddit for no reason at this point In other words its still totally okay to humiliate people on reddit as long as they arent richfamousable to sue I appreciate the impossible situation into which Reddit was thrown by this whole thing I think that in the circumstances you did the best you could I understand that you were being flooded with legal threats and had to make some tough decisions I expect the leader of my country to make tough decisions and I expect the same from website admins I am a pragmatist and I recognize that situations are fluid while you assess the various options and potential consequences Your ultimate decision was careful and deliberate I think what is sticking in everyones craw is the feigned morality I can only assume that such language is there as a coveryourass measure for those mining your response for media quotes Many are quick to latch onto such language and scream that you allow other subs that are much more immoral As a pragmatist my thinking is well the existence of those subs is not threatening to bankrupt the site at the moment so we do not have to worry about them right now More generally I think that arguing hypocrisy is a fundamentally cheap and valueless argument Your job is tending to the going concern of the site As such you have to make tough calls when a tough situation arises The very nature of tough calls is that folks will be pissed no matter what you do In this instance I think you have endeavored to make the choice that is best for the ongoing existence of Reddit Had you stood on some sort of principle and allowed the site to be bankrupted by aggrieved victims of a hacking scandal then you would have killed the very forum in which folks are currently criticizing your actions tldr You made a tough call in a tough situation and I support your decision ITT Reddit is REALLY defensive of its creepy CP deleted What are you going to do about rphotoplunder  Reddit government This whole conversation is just devolving into How about this subreddit I find offensive or objectionable Why is this not banned If youre going to ban rthefappening then ban all the things If there was a TLDR for this post it should read Contentwise our stance has been and will be If it doesnt legally require us to take action and doesnt violate our own rules we try not to mess with it However in this very extreme circumstance without precedent a questionable subreddit was BREAKING the freaking site for everyone so we had no choice but to ban it This is reasonable to me but people love finding conspiracy where there is none and crying oppressioncensorship when thats not really whats going on Since when did reddit become the man We all love this site for its freedom and its largely because of the work of the site creators and admins that weve been able to create that culture Can we not lend them a little credence when they try to explain their actions As theyve admitted they got some timing wrong and didnt explain themselves as clearly as they could have the first time But again this situation is without precedent Honestly this kind of frank explanation is more than we could expect from the head of almost any company and I for one appreciate that A subreddit got banned in order to protect the site as a whole Had reddit not banned it they would have had to continue allocating more resources to policing it which surely would have sparked more outrage as to why effort was being spent on allowing people to keep endlessly mirroring stolen photos They made a reasonable call they had to make and chose the lesser of two evils No ones trying to censor or oppress anyone Its still reddit Grow up and deal with it To the top commenters who are trying to discredit a justified explanation by calling out other subreddits they dont like So you want an open platform but when a forum begins to break the foundation of that platform in a way that would harm the experience for everyone you think that should be allowed to continue But then when that platformbreaking forum is banned you then start witchhunting other forums you dont agree with out of spite for the banning you dont like  calling for more bans which would then further hurt the openness of the site Do you see the irony here You do what you have to do to protect your site Whether people like it or not is their decision The beauty of being a human being is having that ability to choose on what you want to be a part of or not People that do like it will continue doing their thing and the individuals that dont will move on unrelated side note the one thing that blows my mind about this whole mess is how powerful basic nudity is insane Ehm No content is HOSTED on reddit so how is DMCA even valid The images were hosted on imgur and other sites linking to them shouldnt be illegal deleted Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things And its still being used for deplorable things Why draw a line in the sand just because its naked famous people And not dead kid images creeper shots or subs devoted entirely to posting images of nonconsenting women Youve already banned subs that have thumbnails disabled so its complete and utter bullshit to say youre only doing this for to satisfy DCMA requests Reddit The site that cares when forced to legally If you are going to ban subreddits hosting stolen images which you should then at least have the decency to ban them all not just the ones where rich celebrities are involved Also fuck you for the phony lecture on the morality of looking at stolen nudes when you allow stolen pics depending on how much trouble it causes you personally These celebrities are just people Theyre not special enough to get this kind of treatment You should either take down all stolen and copyrighted photos of natures hosted on this site and remove the related subreddits or keep the celebrity photos and The Fappening up Its a double standard that makes you guys sound really hypocritical Everyone is pulling the whole violation of privacy card just because a few famous people got hacked when this type of thing happens to thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people every day and ends up on here or related sites Its not fair that those people go unspoken for but an actress and a model get special treatment Either everything is fair game or nothing is And why play it off like this was some moral decision You didnt want to get sued by the celebrities why not just say that httpimgurcomgalleryZcieKY TlDr Leaked pictures were fun it was a fun weekPeriod Leave the celebrities alone  Reddit admins Pandering to Hollywood What about all of the other similar content for non celebs Hey  its not my job to be reaching out to the community but here it goes anyways So reddits anything goes attitude doesnt apply to Hollywood That says a lot I dont understand reddit we banned r the fappening but Full movies on youtube is perfectly fine among other subreddits Its all fine until some one takes notice eh I respect your response and appreciate your explanation Stolen images and ESPECIALLY child pornography should NOT be a part of this or any other community I hope your workload becomes more manageable and I appreciate your site very very much Thank you You werent hosting the infringing material so I dont see why you mention the DMCA infringement notices as justification for taking down the r the fappening In an interview recently conducted with an ex Reddit moderator details have emerged that suggests initial speculation on content manipulation within Redditcom for the purpose of profit for rd parties to be not only true but common place in practice among certain members of its moderation team Although the source of these accusations has declined to comment on specific cases of such behaviour IndieJuice has been informed that content manipulation for rd party profit is part of a much larger issue within Reddits internal posting and user relationship structure The extent to which is currently unknown Original allegations of content manipulation arose from members of Reddits own community as part of an online controversy surrounding allegations of nepotism within the video game industry Such allegations were dismissed by a member of Reddits administration team as the work of another online community in an attempt to discredit a known games developer as well as embroil their associates in a sex scandal by method of an internet raid Given new light on the matter such claims are only partially valid While an attempt was made by an alternative online community to influence specific content on Redditcom the practice of content manipulation is itself an issue that has been common place on specific subreddits by members of their own moderation team IndieJuices source on this matter has suggested that moderators on particular subreddits have engaged in the practice of content manipulation to unfairly benefit specific websites as well as platform favourable discussion for a rd party at the price of luxuries All of which remains unknown to the subreddits subscribers Though the source was unwilling to provide specific instances of such behaviour examples were given Trading content flair and an ask me anything for particular users was standard in a favour for favour trade Though the purpose might vary for a moderator accepting such a request it was implied that such trades are made at an equal benefit for both parties involved The implication of such evidence in the case of preexisting questions of nepotism raises further concern for the question of corruption within the video game industry Current discussion on the matter has only ever suggested at the existence of such corruption and has as such been limited to possibility The form of corruption suggested by IndieJuices source is extensive It is also very particular in that it extends itself far beyond normal questions of ethical conduct and acceptable practice Though IndieJuice is unable to mention further specifics that implicate members of Reddits administration team in general informal misconduct despite the interview revealing as much what may be said is that specific moderators are involved in the original controversy of ethical press coverage itself The scale of this entire issue has yet to make itself known though the source did hint at the fact that major video game news sites and members of their associated press might also be involved or at the very least specific wellknown individuals acting of their own accord Though the original controversy raised on Reddit focused specifically on a game developer recent events have caused the entire ethic of journalism within the video game industry to come into question This also includes quality of content and the nature of favourable reviews in the instance of preexisting relationships Reaction to this issue has been mixed by those both within the scope of controversy and those beyond What may be said is that it is no longer an issue of misogynists on the loose in social media but of the ability of those whom wish to express themselves being able to do so safely On both sides of the argument httpssoundcloudcomuserrecordingxm Audio file is back up and backed up httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvTkBMAHUkibY First offfuck you guys You claim a moral high road on this issue only when the heat is on I have a feeling this will continue to the point of invested interests change the landscape of this once great website Sellouts is what this sites operations team is becoming Inb the Comcast edit This is all well and good and I am not normally one to care about internet drama However I still cannot get over how a moderator from rblackladies was shadowbanned for interupting the culture of reddit when she was coming to the admins when her subreddit was being raided by a subreddit like rgreatapeshttpwwwredditcomrcirclebrokecommentsfgbfevidentlyinterferingwiththecultureofa Then in the same week reddit takes such a righteous stand against rTheFappening Seriously whats going on here This site is starting to have the reputation of being the cesspool of the internet rather than the front page of the internet I went from not wanting people to know I used this site because it is so very dorky to not wanting people to know I use this site because it is so racist sexist creepy mean deplorable etc It is time to clean this place up ualienth can you explain how this situation ever got that far Reddit rule  is pretty damn straightforward Dont post personal information Cant you argue that leaked photos that are an essential part of a persons private life and were never intended for public distribution completely violates this rule with no questions asked anyway The double standard here is horrible Whats the point of banning dox and yet allowing stolen content to be posted like that deleted You cant moderate like chan and expect to be treated like the New York Times deleted so let me guess rrapingwomen is going to be left alone right When will something be done about subreddit squatters The existing system is not working Qgyh is able to retain top mod of many defaults and large subreddits just because he posts a comment every two months This is harming reddit as a community when lower mods are vetod and removed by someone who is only a mod for the power trip Will something be done about this Things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material So  of the stuff on rpics where people are posting copyrighted material without permission of the owners deleted Are all DMCA takedowns posted to rChillingEffects If yes why is this one missing If no why the change from the policy announced very recently httpwwwredditcomrRoadcamcommentsggccruyqt Hi First of all Thanks for doing this AMA On your previous AMA you said that Ellen was not used as a scapegoatsourcehttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentscxedniamstevehuffmanthenewceoofredditamacszukn Yet it seems that uknthing that he was responsible for the mess in AMA including Victoria being fired source httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscucyeanoldteamatredditcszpi And uyishan added some light on the case here httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsdautmcontentpolicyupdateamathursdayjulythpmctnhc and even Reddits former chief engineer Bethanye Blount source httprecodenetredditchiefengineerbethanyeblountquitsafterlessthantwomonthsonthejob thought that Ellen Pao was put on a glass cliff And when she fell because Reddit became blind with rage for a course she didnt pick and the firing she didnt decided nobody of any authority came to her aid It felt incredibly planned Do you still hold the opinion that she wasnt used as scapegoat uspez I am confused on the illegal portion Are we allowed to talk about pirating but not link it in rtpb Can we have a discussion in rtrees about why we should produce marijuana but no how to produce it This seems like a very large grey area in terms of everything deleted In Ellen Paos opedhttpwwwwashingtonpostcomopinionswecannotlettheinternettrollswinbadbebdcstoryhtml in the Washington Post today she said But to attract more mainstream audiences and bring in the bigbudget advertisers you must hide or remove the ugly How much of the push toward removing ugly elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit EDIT Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence  This is troubling because although it seems reasonable on the surface in practice there are people who scream harassment when any criticism is levied against them How will you determine what constitutes harassment EDIT  Proposed definition of harassment  Harassment is defined as repetitive unwanted nonconstructive contact from a person or persons whose effect is to annoy disturb threaten humiliate or torment a person group or an organization EDIT  uspez response  httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsdjjxwletstalkcontentamactsn wwwRedditcomrules outlines the  rules of reddit Theyre really vague and the rest of the Reddit wiki has tonnes of extra details on what the rules actually imply Whats the plan for centralizing the rules so they make up a Content Policy  Recently you made statementshttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentscxedniamstevehuffmanthenewceoofredditamacszykfocontext that many mods have taken to imply a reduction in control that moderators have over their subredditshttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentscxedniamstevehuffmanthenewceoofredditamacszykfo Much of the concern around this is the potential inability to curate subreddits to the exacting standards that some mod teams try to enforce especially in regards to hateful and offensive comments which apparently would still be accessible even after a mod removes them On the other hand statements made here and elsewhere point to admins putting more consideration into the content that can be found on reddit so all in all messages seem very mixed Could you please clarify a exactly what you meanenvision when you say there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed It doesnt have to be easy but it shouldnt be impossible and b whether that is was an off the cuff statement or a peek at upcoming changes to the reddit architecture What standard decides what is bullying harassment abuse or violent Surely since youre fat you need to commit suicide is all four and undesirable What about an individual saying in private I think fat people need to commit suicide  not actively bullying others but stating an honest opinion What about I think being fat is gross but you shouldnt kill yourself or I dont like fat people I ask because all those behaviors and more were wrapped in the fatpeoplehate drama Surely there were unacceptable behaviors But as a consequence a forum for acceptable behavior on the issue is gone Couldnt that happen to other forums  couldnt someone take offense to antigay marriage advocates and throw the baby out with the bath water Who decides what is and isnt bullying Is there an appeal process Will there be public records In short what is the reasonable standard that prevents antibullying to become bullying itself deleted Can you please speak on why real members are still being shadowbanned even after you claimed that they never should be For reference httpsnpredditcomrKotakuInActioncommentsddcensorshipmodofrneofagshadowbannedforasking Note Im not involved in any of the communities represented in the link I found it on rall yesterday and want to know the reason why people are still being shadowbanned EDIT Thanks to the spez and the other admins that replied Folks please stop downvoting them if you dont like their answer I asked why people are still being shadowbanned and the answer is because they dont have an alternative yet but theyre working on it It may not be the answer some of you hoped for but its enough for me Spezs reply I stand by my statement like Id like to use it as seldom as possible and we are building better tools as we speak You really need to clarify Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence because thats rather vague and is very much open to interpretation one persons definition of harassment is not necessarily anothers  is it harassment just because one person says so To be honest I see nothing here thats really new to the existing content policy outside of the common decency opt in which Im probably ok with  that will depend on how its implemented and what is classified as abhorrent Thanks for doing this AMA Im a moderator of more than a few NSFW subreddits including rBDSMcommunity and rBDSM and as I stated in the teaser announcement earlier this week this decision and the specific wording is worrying I want to specifically address this  Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people As well as your earlier comment about things being seen as offensive and obscene There are sections of the world and even the United States where consensual BDSM and kink are illegal You can see where this is the type of announcement that raises more than a few eyebrows in our little corner of the world At what point do the minority opinion and positions be accepted as obscene offensive and unwanted BDSM between two consenting adults has been seen and labeled as both offensive and obscene for decades now Hi everyone answering these questions I have a few questions that I like probably most of reddit would like answers to Like a recent AMA I asked questions in the bold will be the meat of the question and the nonbolded will be context If you dont know an answer to a question say so and do so directly Honesty is very much appreciated With that said here goes Content Policy  What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech but not harassing Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones Are users and by extension subreddits allowed to behave in this way or will this be banned or censored  What is the policy regarding well these subreddits These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole These usually come up during AskReddit threads of where would you not go or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned Edit WatchPeopleDie shouldnt be included and is definitely not as bad as the others See herehttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsdjjxwzctsk  What actually is the harassment policy Yes I know the definition thats practically copypasta from the announcement but could we have examples You dont have to define a hard rule in fact itd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering but itd be helpful to have an example  What are your thoughts on some peoples interpretation of the rules as becoming a safespace A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this and as such are not happy about it I personally didnt read the rules that way but I can see how it may be interpreted that way  Do you have any plans to update the rules page It at the moment has  rules and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule  which is at best reaching in regards to it  What is the best way to report harassment For example should we use rredditcoms modmail or the contactredditcom email How long should we wait before bumping a modmail for example  Who is allowed to report harassment Say Im a moderator and decide to check a users history and see theyve followed around another user to  different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot Should I report it to the admins Brigading  In regards to subreddits for mocking another group what is the policy on them Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever such as rShitRedditSays rSRSsucks the Badpire rButtcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit SRS has gone out of its way to harass in the past and while bans may not be applied retroactively some have recently said theyve gotten death threats after being linked to from there  What are the current plans to address brigading Will reddit ever support NP and maybe implement it or implement another way to curb brigading This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits  Is this a good definition of brigading and if not what is it Many mods and users cant give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it This forces them to resort to in SubredditDramas case banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads or in ShitRedditSays case not do anything at all Related  What is spam Like yes we know what obvious spam is but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content  Regarding the Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech comment how do you feel about this this this or this I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now but its not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions especially during the rcreepshots debacle even with the literal words bastion of free speech  How do you plan to implement the new policy If the policy is substantially more restrictive such as combating racism or whatnot I think youll have a problem in the long run because there is just way too much content on reddit and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned  Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA and if so what was the point of it It seems like from the announcement you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit and this has made some people understandably upset  Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events I know this has been stressful but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat sometimes untrue but whatever experiences and whatnot I dont think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team and former team to be quite honest are quite concerning  httpnpredditcomrannouncementscommentsdautm

Manager Erik Martin httpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsiuzaiamaredditgeneralmanageramacuuxbcontext  Were a free speech site with very few exceptions mostly personal info and having to stomach occasional troll reddit like picsofdeadkids or morally quesitonable reddits like jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this reddit blogpost httpswwwredditcomrblogcommentspmjfanecessarychangeinpolicy this one is my favourite  At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses opinions on how people use the reddit platform We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use    We understand that this might make some of you worried about the slippery slope from banning one specific type of content to banning other types of content Were concerned about that too and do not make this policy change lightly or without careful deliberation We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal ThenCEO Yishan Wong October httpsarchiveisuTcEK  We stand for free speech This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it reddits core values May httpwwwredditblogcomweresharingourcompanyscorevalueshtml   Allow freedom of expression   Be stewards not dictators The community owns itself And of course do I even need to add it Alexis Ohanian literally calling reddit a bastion of free speech February httpwwwforbescomsiteskashmirhillredditcofounderalexisohaniansrosyoutlookonthefutureofpolitics Now with bonus Google post saying how proud he is of that quotehttpsarchiveiskNnPs There are many more examples from yourself and other key figures at reddit including Alexis confirming that reddit has promoted itself as a centre of free speech and that this belief was and is widespread amongst the corporate culture of reddit If you want to read more check out the new subreddit rBoFS Bastion of Free Speech which gathered all these examples and more in less than two days So now that youve had time to plan your response to these inevitable accusations of hypocrisy my question is this who do you think you are fooling Steve TLDR How is the Reddit administration planning to improve their communication with users about your policies Over the last year there have been a number of moments where top employees have dropped the ball when it came to talking with users about Reddits direction  Yishans blog post Every Man is Responsible For His Own Soulhttpswwwredditcomrblogcommentsfoivoeverymanisresponsibleforhisownsoul in response to banning rthefappening This post caused more confusion than it resolved until alienth who no longer works at Reddit made a different post explaining the situation in much clearer termshttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfpdaxtimetotalk  Alexis fired Victoria and did not alert the AMA team causing the moderators and AMA users including people who were giving AMAs that day stress and confusion Those mods shut down the subreddit Note Im not asking for an explanation of Victorias firing  Ellen Pao gave an interview off of Reddithttpmobilenytimescomtechnologyredditmoderatorsshutdownpartsofsiteoverexecutivesdismissalhtmlreferrer saying the Reddit administration was not concerned about the shutdown because it was just a vocal minority that was upset with the whole VictoriaAMA debacle She later clarified she was talking about the people insulting her but the mixup could have been avoided if she had talked with us directly This was shortly followed by the We Apologize posthttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscbomweapologize which probably should have come before the offReddit interview regardless of how much she would have been downvoted  The new stated plan for improved mod tools was deliberately broad  and krispykrackers admitted this new time plan was made hastily and without much researchhttpswwwredditcomrmodnewscommentscbnuuweapologizecsuiy so we should not reasonably expect it to be fulfilled One of your head engineers resigned two days ago stating she did not think she could deliver on promises being made to the communityhttpwwwlatimescombusinesstechnologylafitnredditchiefengineerleavesstoryhtml  Your own post announcing this AMAhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsdautmcontentpolicyupdateamathursdayjulythpm stated that neither you nor Alexis ever envisioned Reddit as a bastion of free speech but it was then directly and instantly called out as being false as Alexis specifically likened Reddit to a bastion of free speech  Ill also include the infamous popcorn comment made by Alexis and a response from krispykrackers about a user shadowbanhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscbomweapologizecsuxe In both cases knthing and krispykrackers apologized and admitted it was a moment of notthinking but an impulsive comment can spread across the community like wildfire Im sure other users have other examples but these are the ones that have stuck with me I intentionally left out the announcement of the rfatpeoplehate banhttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsbpamremovingharassingsubreddits because I thought it was clear why those subreddits were being banned though admittedly many users were confused about the new policy and it quickly became another mess I think this AMA is a good first step toward better communication with the user base but only if your responses are as direct and clear as they once were I wish I didnt have to fear the Announcements comments section like Jabba the Hutts janitor fears the bathroom  ie things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material This is a poorlyworded idea Copyrighted material is not illegal nor should linking to copyrighted material be considered illegal Eg if I were to link to a New York Times article discussing these proposed changeshttpwwwnytimescomtechnologyredditstevehuffmanhtml I am linking to copyrighted material Often its impossible to know the copyright status of something hence the approach on this should be limited to a takedownbased approach ie if someone receives a legitimate notice then the offending content should be suspended or removed but should the subreddit or user be banned however it should be up to whichever site is hosting the material What perhaps would be the most clearcut example of doing something illegal to violate another persons copyright is posting the full text of a copyright book as a series of comments  that would be inappropriate ITT People who have been waiting to hit ctrlv save for at least a day now deleted deleted Anything illegal ie things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material This is a huge mistake  of content uploaded to imgur to be rehosted is infringing on copyrights Isnt someone at reddit an investor in imgur btw Copyright infringement is handled via DMCA If someone has a complaint the DMCA laws outline specific steps to take to remedy that and the person accused has a chance to respond in a clearly defined way In addition removing copyright infringement at all is you reddit saying that you are going to moderate such content Once you take this stance guess what You are now actually liable for all infringing material on the entire site That means you can and will get sued for real money It will destroy reddit The DMCA is intended to protect service providers reddit because they do not police for copyrighted content By moderating such content without legal notice DMCA you lose those protections Have fun with that I guess Since AMA I guess my question is how a company running a site like reddit can be so damn clueless on things that were hashed out ages ago  Anything illegal ie things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material Illegal in which jurisdiction specifically Anything illegal ie things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material Discussing illegal activities such as drug use is not illegal Many ruleabiding subreddits like rGaming rVideos rMovies and rMusic thrive on copyrighted multimedia content for sharing such as movie trailers or gameplay footage Each of these subreddits are  million members strong and are some of Reddits most popular communities While this is not malicious use of copyrighted material for profit this is a very blurry line one that services such as YouTube constantly deletes content for even on nonmonetized videos How do you plan to tread this line without diminishing what makes these subs so popular are you going to ban vicious hate subs like rledootgeneration Why was rNeoFag banned when there has been no evidence that it or its users ever took part in harassment Why was a mod of the sub then shawdowbanned for asking about ithttpswwwredditcomrKotakuInActioncommentsddcensorshipmodofrneofagshadowbannedforasking Especially when you have recently said that shawdowbans are for spammers only deleted  Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence This needs to be removed There is no other way around it Its too broad Is ratheism bullying rchristianity Is rconservative bullying rpolitics We need opposing views We need people whose stupidity clashes against our values Most importantly we need to learn how to deal with this people with our words We need to foster an environment where those people are silenced not with rules but with the logic and support of the community Its been said that you are going to remove the more cancerous subreddits Im curious as to whether ShitRedditSays will be included among this category On the face of it a place where reprehensible comments are pointed out right It must have been two years ago now when shit hit the fan and I found a link to a thread where one redditor clearly in a distressed state had made a post alluding to their future suicide Now of course the vast majority of responses were what you would expect from most humans Compassionate and sincere posts offering this person help and support Who on earth would tell a person in this condition to kill themselves Or worse tell them the world would be better off without them Enter ShitRedditSays The comments made towards this person by a significant portion of people are among the most disturbing things I have ever seen on this site It was the sort of thing I would expect to see on SRS as a showcase of how awful Reddit is So I went to the sub to see if they were talking about it They were but not in the way I had expected They were bragging They were laughing They were celebrating The suicidal person in question was affiliated with the MRA sub something that SRS greatly opposes So much so they brigaded the thread the person had posted in and told them to kill themselves Repeatedly told them And when the person did they were happy Because to them this was a war And anything was acceptable Telling a suicidal person to kill themselves was perfectly fine That is how lacking in perspective many of these people are Much of what was said was deleted shortly afterwards so it would not be visible anymore Well almost all of it The below is only a tiny fraction of what was said There was a lot worse httpiimgurcomehQNUpng httpiimgurcomqMVpng httpiimgurcomnSCSVpng I had always thought SRS was merely a sub dedicated to showcasing the darker side of this site A way of promoting change but nothing malicious I messaged one of the mods about what had happened expecting them to condemn the behavior but instead they bragged about it like some sort of psychopath It was one of the most fucked up conversations I have ever had Further examination of the sub and their mods clearly showed that this is a group of people who are in fact quite hateful Many of the mods displayed blatant prejudices against various groups And the media doesnt show this side of SRS for whatever reason Possibly out of laziness or perhaps because SRS deletes the vast majority of their more shameful history We hear about how they got rid of the disgusting Jailbait sub something that I and Im sure many others was very happy about But we never hear about the racism sexism or harassment that they so frequently partake in So on the face of it SRS is this progressive humanitarian group that Reddit can showcase as an example of how the site is not just a cesspit of evil Am I right And thats how it appears to many users of the sub too Young teenagers in many cases Progressive well meaning individuals who want to highlight the unsavory things that are said throughout this site Except we know now that those controlling SRS and many of their more active members have much more sinister intentions than that Clearly they have a dangerous influence over young and impressionable people who are unaware of these true intentions There is also a dark side communities whose purpose is reprehensible and we dont have any obligation to support them And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all My questions  Is the above statement genuine Will ShitRedditSays be removed like the rest of the cancerous subreddits Yes or No The answer to both questions is the same rneofag did nothing against the rules you placed before today and with your new policy We did not use personal or private information we used information that was publicly available on the forum Neogaf to make fun of and satirize the community We have never DDosed or done anything illegal When we tried to make a new subreddit with out the word fag in it rNeogafInAction you immediately banned it as well Im not going to conjecture here but something seems odd about how a niche small subreddit got banned What is your relationship with Malka  founder of Neogaf Something seems odd here Steve how do you plan on improving communication between mods and admins Will you value their input on actions such as firing Victoria Also will previous shadowbans be possibly reversed after the shadowban policy change   Anything that harasses bullies or abuseshttpwwwredditblogcompromoteideasprotectpeoplehtml an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence So like when people get shadowbanned from rpolitics and rnews for supporting a republicanconservative agenda What will the process be for determining what is offensive and what is not Will these rules be clearly laid out for users to understand If something is deemed offensive but is consensual such as BDSM will it be subject to removal Have any specific subs already been subject to discussion of removal and if so have Admins decided on which subs will be eliminated How do you envision open and honest discussion happening on controversial issues if content being deemed offensive is removed If offensive subs are removed do you foresee an influx of now rulebreaking users flooding otherwise ruleabiding subs What is your favorite Metallica album and why is it Master of Puppets There has also been mention of allowing deleted messages to be seen how would these be handled in terms of containing offensive content Will anything be done regarding inactive squatter mods specifically allowing their removal on large subs EDIT To everyone asking why I put offensive in quotation marks  from the previous announcement There has been a lot of discussion lately on reddit in the news and here internally about reddits policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it One of the things you just do not seem to fully grasp is that it is reddits complete incompetence at interacting with the community that has caused majority of the damage and frustration so far The community has huge issues with how the sites admin mechanics completely lack any sort of transparency how shadowbans are widely abused across the site even though you claim they should only be used for dealing with spammers Part of the reason Paos reign at reddit was so tumultuous was because reddits communication and announcements degraded into rambling nonspecific blog posts It was a damn disgraceful way of running a community orientated company You owe it to your users to fix these issues to communicate with clarity to fix the technical deficit of the site I and a lot of users on this site want to keep the original policy of if its not illegal and its not brigading or dissemination of personal information its okay even if we do not agree with it but I have to say it will not be the cessation of this policy which will destroy reddit its the issues I list below Current Major issues  Time and time reddits administration has shown a complete lack of ability to come up with concrete rules for what is harassment or brigading You cant implement new policies fairly unless you have proper rules and regulations inplace  Inconsistency in the application of your policies  why was FPH banned but SRS not I am willing to bet that as a percentage of the sub population SRS engaged in more brigading activity The way the bans were selectively handed down just reeks of partiality  Shadowbanning lack of transparency lack of proper moderator audit logs if content is being removed from the site there needs to be a proper log of what is happening and why Why cant we have an automated sub that details all the moderation actions taken by the sites admins names could be redacted if necessary Say I repeatedly call Donald Trump a  and set out to publicly humiliate him online as much as possible is that harassment What about if I call Anita Sarkeesian a  and do the same What if I do the same to someone popular on reddit is that harassment Harassment seems to have a lot of legal definitions depending on the part of the world you are in You need to pick one and explicitly define it and it needs to be reputation neutral ie apply to the popular and unpopular in equal measure it should also have a public interest clause  Lack of general respect for the community especially the mods The whole Victoria scandal illustrates this perfectly again this links back to the communication problem  Lack of clear and succinct communication Lack of meaningful discourse between the sites owners and the community No effective medium of communication blogs suck for this btw TLDR Fix the sites tools and administration structure before you start thinking about making philosophical changes to how the site is run and what version of freedom of speech you use Doing otherwise is just another insult to users Overall this site needs a proper intravenous dose of priority management The management style is the main problem with reddit not its sometimes rumbustiousdistasteful community Set out a proper code of ethics for reddit and stick to it please And for once try to make in unambiguous  Anything illegal ie things that are actually illegal such as copyrighted material Discussing illegal activities such as drug use is not illegal In which jurisdiction exactly Need we now worry about Blasphemy laws  Publication of someones private and confidential information Does this apply to public figures I wonder  Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people So no more antiNazi speech then And more importantly no honest often muchneeded negative criticisms of others on Reddit or off  Similar to NSFW another type of content that is difficult to define but you know it when you see it is the content that violates a common sense of decency This classification will require a login must be opted into will not appear in search results or public listings and will generate no revenue for Reddit This is super vague and therefore in need of clarification Some people might consider criticism of commonly held beliefs or of cultural traditions to be against the common sense of decency each of which are needed to allow us to grow evolve and improve our civilization For others this may only cover repulsive imagery such as vomit and feces This is the only example in which I would approve of your suggested behavior personally For others still imagery of abuse and even further of graphic death which are often required to guide others toward a sense of muchneeded sympathy  When they did they accepted my reasoning Or perhaps they were simply afraid of you doing the same to them as is the folly of the king  Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence How precisely do you intend to make this determination Different people have different tolerances to asshattery and some wield their victim hood as weapons very insincerely I would never go to fatpeoplehate or srs or the like and imagine I would feel welcomed but neither would I feel intimidated into silence because of their hate Their echo chambers may be filled with despicable people but I dont feel threatened by their existence Yet other people feel differently to the point they feel they must silence others And maybe they legitimately do feel threatened But personally I feel like being offended by what anonymous people say online is beyond ridiculous A comment carries as much weight as the effort taken to make it and around here that effort is as close to zero as possible So who gets to make the determination of harassment or threatening behaviour You All the admins by vote Is one person feeling like they are offended enough   What if equally many people think the people claiming intimidation are wrong Having a content policy is all well and good but unless you can describe EXACTLY how it will be applied its just empty sentiment Why was uDancingqueen shadowbanned mere DAYS after your claim that shadowbans were only for spammers and not real users Im going to presume that rneofag was banned for using publicly available pictures of NeoGAF users in its banner since there was a complete lack of transparency regarding this ban Why then was rstarcraftcirclejerk let off with a slap on the wrist for including the leaked nudes of a user and subsequently spamming his inbox with username mentions in order to post said pictures Is this not considered harassment Why did one warrant a complete ban and the other simply having the offending material removed Also Why was rneogafinaction banned despite being created months before the banning of rneofag Im hoping youll live up to your promise of transparency uspez Disclaimer I think Destiny is an asshole I didnt browse NeoFAG I care about fairness equal application of the rules and transparency What actions are being done about brigading and will action only be limited to communities whos political opinions reddit admins dont agree with Even now this thread is being brigaded hard by members of SRS AMR GamerGhazi and SRD calling for the heads of subreddits they dont like such as the downright innocuous KotakuInAction Past comments by admins such as uknthing saying the SRS isnt active enough to be worth bothering enforcing is truly unacceptable and an outright double standard deleted I think this is the one that most people will be concerned about  Anything that harasses bullies or abuses an individual or group of people these behaviors intimidate others into silence Prohibiting harassment bullying and abuse sounds great in principle Can you offer a bit more about how you will define those terms and how you will enforce such a prohibition of content Some examples might go a long way toward clarifying your thoughts on this issue The Reddit staff is rather small compared to other socialcommunitybased websites I cant imagine it can effectively respond on a casebycase reporting basis Do you have a different vision for rapidly and efficiently enforcing a prohibition on this type of content Remember if you dont like whats said here dont buy reddit gold Does Reddit have a place where I can download all the information its collected on me so far Today were reading about a lot of companies pulling their web presence from the EU presumably because of their inability or unwillingness to comply with the GDPR Did Reddit have any sort of issues getting into compliance in the EU Im assuming Reddits still up and running on that side of the pond I didnt know you were CTO now Im sure somebody can express these concerns better than me as I dont understand the technical jargon that much but theres been some discussion that this sounds like Reddit takes ownership of creative content For example in rWritingPrompts if someone posts a story its expected they own their content Some of the wording sounds like Reddit can now take their content and do with it what they want available for syndication broadcast distribution or publication by other companies organizations or individuals who partner with Reddit I doubt thats what was meant or how it will be used but the wording sounds like Reddit can just take someones story and publish it or sell it to a movie studio Can we get some clarification on this This is what we tell users nowhttpswwwredditcomrWritingPromptswikicopyright so is it all still accurate We knew you were all feeling left out when we didnt email Youre welcome Over the last few years weve built a dedicated antievil team to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse Is that supposed to be a swipe at Google or something If I opt out from all of these trackings on this personalization preferenceshttpswwwredditcompersonalization page does it mean Reddit cant track that information or that Reddit still gets the information but just doesnt use it for advertisements Can Reddit provide an option to download our history Given that the API will only return the last  results this seems to be the only way we would be able to find and delete old comments  you got beat to reddit by stalin I expected more of you How can I give you irrevocable rights to my content  Im pretty sure that under the laws in my country a contract clause securing irrevocable rights to my creations is void This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but with a GDPR compliance notice Lolscrolled down looking for a TLDR Reddit spoiled me Not too long a read though deleted  This may include your IP address useragent string browser type operating system referral URLs device information eg device IDs pages visited links clicked the requested URL hardware settings and search terms Would it kill you to just not bulklist every item you could get in trouble for Would it kill you to simply stop collecting the things you dont really need like device IDs hardware settings The GDPR is supposed to protect our data Instead its just causing companies like reddit to just put a message in authorizing themselves to take the largest list of regulated items they can possibly think of What do you need my hardware settings for The  Your Content section is pretty much a major threat to all the writing subreddits Does this apply to only current content on Reddit or does it apply to any historical caches on servers Whats the time scope to Content Because this content section could basically allow Reddit to dig through the edit histories of content even after the author has removed it from the current posting and allow Reddit to do what they will with it As a show of good faith Will Reddit provide a means that after authors clear their own posts of content they can request that cached historical post versions be purged and have such license taken by Reddit on that removed content voided Or are authors going to somehow have to figure out how to practically hit ourselves with DMCA Notices to force the removal How it feels to be the original old Redditor  I generally have a reason to be angry with announcement posts WHY AM I NOT ANGRY AT THIS ONE Edit Whoa  thanks for the gold anonymous stranger t h a n k Why do you claim the perpetual and irrevocable right to use my content This is HIGHLY illegal under the Unfair Terms Directive in EU uKeyserSosa When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services you grant us a worldwide royaltyfree

you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content Is there a reason every company in the world seems to be sending out revisions to their privacy policy at the same time Finally Ah my karma is finally safe Facebook did this why is Reddit copying Facebook on this s As a weirdo who actually reads these damn things Im going to take the time to thank you guys for not sneaking in a mandatory arbitration agreement It seems like every almost other site that sent me one had one of those hiding in their ToSs There are a lot of things that you guys do that I disagree with but this is something I thought was worth calling out deleted N O I C E deleted  What does submitting the Got It button do on the new privacy policy update notification Does it place any cookies or send any data or is it just a clientside dismissal of the element You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit or any subreddits that you moderate without our written approval Does this mean we need prior written approval for AMAs Several of my subs receive requests to do AMAs from streaming services and device makers We require moderator approval and verification to do the AMAs so in essence we as mods need to reach an agreement in at least an informal manner that they can visit the sub and coordinate with these companies Typically we are coordinating with a pr or media specialist not the AMA host since the host is usually a top executive who has delgated the details Thanks deleted I assume that somewhere in this agreement is the nowstandard no class action lawsuits and forced binding arbitration clauses that the US courts decided to allowuphold Not like I foresee ever having a reason to sue Reddit but every other damn company put them in so why not you too Digital Lawyer over here Happy to help if needed I like this I feel weird Will those who are outside of the EU enjoy the same protections the GDPR offers too in an alongfortheride fashion Or are two separate Reddits being rolled out one for the EU and one for the rest of the world Am I wrong in thinking that Reddit is in absolute violation of GDPR because it a has no place to download all your user data b has no provision to deleted your ENTIRE user history deleting your account just hides your profile and leaves all commentspost etc as well as other things like tracking others have mentioned Why did you send  PMs to my inbox today saying this thank you European politicians for actually giving a fuck Obviously we all love reddit I think we all just hope to be not taken advantage of and to not be treated underhandedly by our favorite websitecircle of life lets be real Reddit is way more than a website Were a community of everyone I appreciate the directness with which the admin handle their business I have my issues time to time but in general I hope Reddit continues to be about our community and not at

but this one should not be Breaking this down because its a slap in the face to not giving any new rights This says that not only can Reddit use the content someone else creates but they dont have to give credit That is interesting Even Facebook doesnt do that as far as I can tell This is a huge disincentive for me to post anything anything at all thats original on this site That used to be what Reddit was all about Unique content every day I do not want to waste my time making something for others to see on this site knowing that not only may I not even be given credit but it could be sold and then used by someone for something morally objectionable Combine that with all the other data you guys are selling off I could very well wind up with my real name attached now As Reddit has auctioned off every copyright protection there would be zero recourse Where in any of this is any indication of moral leadership Policy statements about lines the company wont cross There arent any

off that fucking chat Stupid ass thing pops up like  times a day for me now Hey I checked everything out and found that the data sharing options were prechecked Wanted to make sure it wont make any

there is a lot of gold being handed out around here I hope no one guilds me Looks around  I said I HOPE NOONE GUILDS ME OMG thank you I was worried about my online privacy As mod of rfamilyman I approve  include inline images within text posts What could possibly go wrong The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback early and often Youre missing the most important step here incorporating the suggested feedback and having leadership that has sufficient resolve and tenacity to change track when they see something isnt working as oned hoped  Id love a list of the  biggest changes in policy and vision youve made as a result of userfeedback since the alpha of the redesign Where were you most wrong and what did you learn from being wrong on those issues How is that helping the team get the redesign even more right prior to launch I spent a few hours attempting to work with the redesign and get atleast some resemblance of what Ive got set up on one my subreddits over the weekend It didnt go well at all This is what we have setup currentlyhttpsiimgurcomxOdFQByjpg over at rNieR  We have a basic animated banner  Posts are stylised and have a number count against them  Thumbnails change depending on the post type NSFW Spoliers Discussions Announcements  Submission buttons overlapping the sidebar image  Custom userflairs with popup text upon mouseover None of this is at all achievable with your redesign and furthermore what you can change is heavily restricted  Banner image heights are limited to  sizes with very little control over their placement  All colours are purely static no gradient support at all  The new userflairs are a huge step backwards in what you can do with them The whole thing quite frankly sucks in its current implementation the only redeeming feature from this entire thing is the new configurable post requirements section Breaking down a standard submission Heres an imagehttpsiimgurcomckfWTpng  As mentioned above our thumbnails are different depending on post type you can currently only assign one default thumbnail in the redesign theres no ability to configure these for spoilersnsfw etc Theres no ability to set the size of the thumbnails either theyre something like x so no nice uniform square thumbnails  There doesnt seem to be a way to align submission flairs to the left hand side with the redesign theyre always on the right not to mention you cannot style them  This is the overall background image of the post you can currently change this in the redesign but then itd clash with item  which is a second background decor image placed in the corner the redesign only allows you to set one BG image and very little control is given as to how youd like to use it  Much like post flairs theres really no customisability in the redesign for userflairs  No ability to even show post rankings let alone style them Theres a load of other things id like to go into such as the inability to use a different font change text colour and so on but theres really no point Just compare what i consider to be a much better styled subreddit than mine rOverwatch to their redesign Imgur album comparisonhttpsimgurcomaXB The redesign is crap Can inline images be hidden in user settings I dont mean to poop on the direction youre taking the site but thats the last possible thing I want to see I already abhor all the lazy reaction gif style comments and this sounds like it will encourage far more  In the meantime all mods now have access to the redesign Im a mod technically but never saw any invites or notifications of access What gives I would never suggest that Redditors are less than angelic but users will abuse inline images in every conceivable way Theyll fill comments with objectionable content such as gore spoilers porn pictures of uspez etc etc etc What steps will you take to protect against this Will mods have the power to toggle this function on and off deleted Im truly excited to see whats next and Im filled to the brim with empathy for the hell that youll reap no matter what it is you do However I still am convinced that while youll compare this to comments will ruin reddit the new designs very intentional attempt to force the user to read comments before reading an articlelink will worsen reddits discourse Forcing the user to click a wholly nonintuitive smaller target link to actually read the article  and having the main title bring up a modal with the comments  is certainly designed around Reddits needs probably driven by a board member time spent on reddit but its only going to make the people commenting without reading the article ratio even worse than it already is I sincerely fear that that will have bigger affects than it seems reddit believes it will deleted Can you make it so people can only send messages if their account is a couple days old Someone was making dozens of accounts to send vulgar photos and rape threats to a lot of women Also blocking via mobile would be nice One question I have about the redesign is that I know you guys were talking about getting rid of messages as they are now and focusing on people using the chat feature Are you still planning on this I have a message thread going on with a friend almost  years and I would hate to lose all our conversations because of this CtrlF search  results Why do you continunously ignore the  requested feature and the  requested moderation and for the first time include inline images within text posts Please tell me these images are not autoexpanded I dislike that feature on forums Not only for bandwid not only for how sluggish my computer can become trying to render a x image not only for the potential viewing of unwanted material but because of rickrollshttpsiimgurcomNmGgDUjpg vreddit is nothing to brag about Its the worst video format used for posts on Reddit Promise me that youll never pull support for the legacy profile and I wont complain about how much I dislike the new layout and design For now a browser extension redirecting to legacy has made the site still usable but after  years of daily use Ill leave Reddit and never look back if the new style profiles become the only option Are you ever going to address the unacceptably poor performance of the redesign Threads about it over at rredesign have just been consistently ignored by the admins The merits of design choices can argued about until we are all blue in the face but a website that performs as poorly as the redesign does is just utterly ridiculous and is going to drive any potential new users not to mention current users away Youre using the wrong characters for that Redesign showing in the comic It should be more like    Can you make it so if the only comments on something are from bots it shows that in some way before clicking It would be nice to avoid seeing  comment on something and then clicking it and its just a bot I prefer reddit to look as clean and boring as possible so I can continue browsing at work without it raising any red flags from people walking by my desk That calbin n hobbs sub has me concerned Your chat feature is absolute cancer There are already communities dedicated to blocking it with adblockers Please add a permanent op out to the chat feature With regard to inline images are you planning on requiring those to be hosted on Reddit If not you run the risk of thirdparty analytics people posting images which track whos looked at a post Imagine if Facebook and imgur struck a deal Any image hosted on imgur and hotlinked into a comment Imgur puts a cookie on your computer Facebook now knows you hang out at rClopClop If so be mindful on a couple of things which youre probably already aware of Most if not all bitmap formats jpg png etc put the header at the beginning of the file The file is read until the end of the data not the end of the file RAR archives put the header at the END of the file If you take a JPG and use copy b jpg  rar combinedfilejpg Youll end up with an file which displays a picture in the browser and can also be opened with zip Id suggest implementing both a size limitation and a file truncator your server looks at the images header and discards everything after the end of the image data The other is if someone posts a picture or video taken with a phone or a super expensive camera the file may end up with embedded gps tags which is exactly what those GoneWild girls would totally love I have some constructive criticism Please stop focusing on ads and instead focus on Reddit and the creators not shitposters from socialmedia sites And stop making chan out of Reddit with all the embeded photos and whatnot I get it Reddit has changed bit never was it as adintrusing as it is now with promoted content and everything from making new profiles to embeded images just turning Reddit into antisocialmedia Been on Reddit a lot longer than this accounts age changed usernames more than once and honestly most of the changes have been great I even like how youve handled advertising for the most part but I cant stress enough how dire the new user pages are Please for the love of god scrap that jumbled mess On Reddit people like to tell jokes by hiding images in text like thishttpsiimgurcomnZXvpng People also use the sentence within which the image is contained to provide context to the image itself I feel that inline images are a net good but preserving this small bit of reddit culturevehicle of humor would be nice Im not sure how itd be done but is inline display of images a default setting What about for particularly large images such as can be found in wallpaper or subreddits dedicated to photography Are there size limits to what can be uploadeddisplayed deleted The chat is shit please make it possible to disable Reddit video is shit Please stop Sounds like an aroundabout way of saying that while we dont like the redesign you know better and well eventually come around Please get rid of the new user profiles They are horrible Am I the only one who wants reddit to stay the same Ive been here a while and have always loved the design Also change and fluidity scare me It looks like you guys are covering your asses from bad reactions to come against the new redesign by showing a pattern of virulent reactions to past features that eventually were successful I would just like to say that by that logic you could do anything and argue that it would be successful eventually no matter feedback which is obviously incorrect Most of the features listed here are fundamentally new features like comments and subreddits Many new features like redesign and users profile are just little adjustments which add little functionality which are obviously built to attract new users but which can just be a pain to users tied to their habits Heres my feedback You guys have already proven that youre bad at this The new profile layout for example is awful You took a simplistic design that worked well and matched the rest of the website and then made it foreign visually confusing and overall terrible to look at You didnt even give users an option to disable it I find it interesting that Reddit continues to make the same types of mistakes that Digg did while at the same time bragging about how they defeated Digg Hubris etc Reddits on a swift course to adding a third website to that Google search graph And what about the popular features that you guys love to inexplicably remove like individual comment scores Is that in the hidden dark history section of this particular museum Nuke the garbage Reddit chat and profile page features already Why did you guys ban rsanctionedsuicide  That sub had some great introspective posts it was refreshing to see another persons view on life and contemplate it Not kidding some of my favourite posts were from that sub It was also a great place for suicidal people to talk about their issues and relate to people in their situation Is it Reddit policy to ban subs associated with undesirables the ban of the sub seems very reactionary Guys dont hide the ads in normal posts Great now I get to see stupid picture shitposts without even clicking on them Title clicks going straight to the comments This will really help with people spouting garbage without reading the content s removed Unlike the new profile feature the new design doesnt look abjectly horrible and I can actually see the content Im looking for instead of  of my screen being useless whitespace This is good What isnt good is the performance rall takes me under a second to display not load right now When I swapped to the beta and refreshed rall my browser completely froze for about thirty seconds before the page actually rendered This is not a network issue the page took roughly the same time to actually download on either display setting but theres some serious optimisation issues going on there It seems like the page was designed and tested solely on fairly powerful machines without even considering the average use case This makes Reddit genuinely unusable EDIT Some performance metrics gauged by scrolling around a content at a reading speed with mouse scrollwheel then using middle mousedrag to scroll to the top of content very quickly then clicking on a link to a subreddit and waiting for it to load Current designhttpsiimgurcomGtWPypng  FPS average New designhttpsiimgurcomXZyurupng  FPS average Ohh I just enabled the redesign layout Looks sharp so far Although I use Desktop at  zoom theres a lot of whitespace zoomed out I found one really big issue for me I dislike that clicking on a thread basically opens a big modal and clicking on the edge closes the thread Thats something USAtodaycom does and I hate it Click the wrong spot and you closed the article If I was using  zoom instead of  it looks even worse Id like the post to fill the whole page Edit rising is missing from the sort dropdown on rall and the sort menu wouldnt open on rpolitics the first  times I clicked it Edit  If Im browsing rpolitics and I click a thread do I really need to see another copy of the sidebar displayed in this open modal I feel like thats taking even more space away from the thread Edit  I think comment chains could use more distinction Im finding it hard to tell if a comment is a toplevel comment or not  Anyways I appreciate announcement posts like this Thanks for sharing whats going on behind the scenes How is this going to effect Reddit Enhancement Suite deleted Speaking of museum when are we getting searches for articles for date Id love to browse submissions that happened in a particular sub in December last year or for a particular date for example This way we can have archives dedicated to our favorite posts and effectively turn Reddit into an internet history museum of sorts Pretty please TLDR You might not like this update and there might be a lot of backlash but we think its a good implementation anyway because what we really think you dont like is change Not that I really blame them for feeling the need to put this out there good updates often are met with a lot of backlash because users just arent used to it yet but I dont think its the best mentality to have going into launching a major update Reddit is pretty good as is if people dont like change and there is no need to implement a change then you probably shouldnt implement that change Its rare for a developer to implement a change people didnt know that they wanted its usually best to just stick to changes people have been asking for already which I havent seen much of on reddit so Im definitely iffy on this Guess well see deleted deleted  What Did We Learn Did We Learn Things Lets Find Out I too like BoJack Horseman Can you or some other admin reply to one of my many PMs about the  worth of reddit gold creddits Im still waiting on Will there be an option to keep the old design how the hell do I get rid of the annoying chat notification I noticed a new chat button at the top right that is constantly reading red and  whether there is a new chat message or not and the few times there is a chat message it is always the exact same check out my youtube channel spam message Great job reddit If you could just stop the pop ups when my cursor goes over a users name If I want to know I will click and I normally dont want to know And stop keeping the video in the screen and playing when I go to comments I went to comments because I watched it I dont want to see it again particularly as it slows EVERYTHING down Reddit was really good as I was not made to review the videos and just go straight to looking at the comments Now I spend most of my time just waiting for video to load wondering why popup boxes are all over my screen blocking out the comments I want to read etc New redesign yay If I could gild all the reddit devs I would Are you going to let us turn off infinite scrolling at some point Holy jesus do I hate infinite scrolling when are you going to make a better search function its seriously trash  In the sites early days uspez and uknthing played around with the design in PaintShopPro  did the first user tests by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks Um what about AaronhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAaronSwartz I swear I feel like he was the one that made all the smart usability decisions like inventing Markdown with John Gruber So what does the front page look like after the redesign They launched commenting The first comment fittingly was about how comments are going to ruin Reddithttpswwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsredditnowsupportscommentsc To be fair comments did ruin reddit The best feature Ive come across latelyhttpsimgurcomaPNcB Everyone is excited but what if its too different Maybe I missed this But was there a poll where we could vote on what changes we would like to see Im guessing you have no information as to why subs get banned I was curious to know why rsanctionedsuicide and rtruesanctionedsuicide got banned yesterday Feels like it is kind of random which ones do and which ones dont Anywaysfigures I may as well try If nothing comes of itoh well Itll become just like everything else in my life then I guess I dont like any of this most users after spending an exhausting  seconds reviewing anything new Please let us stay on the current theme You dont need to support it you dont need to bug fix it just please give us an option to willingly use the outdated version arent you afraid inline images are going to ruin reddit The user profile redesign sucks ass They forgot censorship of threads and subs that doesnt follow the admin ideologies and msm narritive uh oh the users dont like our onesizefitsall unCSSable redesign Quick Remind them of all the other features they were wrong to hate  The first comment fittingly was about how comments are going to ruin Reddit  Its hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now but as a new feature it wasnt without controversy In fact many users  argued passionately against subreddits  That same year the admins also launched our first desktop redesign which received its share of good bad and constructive reviews Oops Your agenda is showing When we made these changes in the past people complained but we pushed through despite the objections and now you all like it And now youre making another change and people will complain and youll push through despite the objections Stop banning subreddits based on mental illness You arent helping anyone and in fact are robbing people of communcation resources they have built up on Reddit Your suicide hotline is a joke copout We are preparing to ruin reddit Here is a longwinded justification for doing so even though its perfectly fine the way it is Can you stop shoving features down our throats that no one wants STOP TRYING TO BE FACEBOOK I think that these redesigns are great but need to be controlled Looks like you guys have it good for now Great a new update Are you going to update the frontpage algorithm again to get more political and make it harder to filter out the ten million trump sub reddits Or maybe update the algorithm because everyone saw how terrible rpolitics is but then replace it with ten separate sub reddits that are carbon copies of rpolitics with the same mods looking at you rnews I cant wait deleted Can you do something about mod abuse Because the moderators are cancer From one of the early responses to comments   Come up with a great simple idea  Wait for a degree of popularity and media attention  Add unnecessary features  Profit Is this what you want Youre certainly at the add unnecessary features point I still hate the new profile Its so much less useful than the legacy profile Also the text is so small its unreadable on my kindle You guys need to stop fixing something that isnt broken just so you can justify having a job How about a feature where you get rid of all the Russian bots and trolls fucking up the platform Or will that take uspez no longer sucking Putins cock first deleted Do any of the features ban TheDonald No Then meh EDIT I love every time that a TD poster pings my inbox REEEEE on snowflakesREEEE on I have to say the newest Android update is a complete dog Its turned the app into a resource hog having sub info auto load is clunky and turns formatting into plain text and stuff loads out way too much like if I go from my comments to the comment to the sub I have to back out of each step even if I switch over to the main section It all seems like a massive step back from the previous version Does it even finally integrate the features of Gold Hey I know you guys are super busy and I appreciate all the work thats been done Im just curious if my suggestion here has been looked athttpsreddittcb Basically my complaint is that in the sidebar if I collapse one of my submenus it should stay collapsed Even though Im still not  on the redesign I find myself using it more and more often You left out the time when you took away vote tallys on comments Your museum sketches look like one of our advertisements for rexhibitart  Snoo on securityhttpsimgurcomBAbfLvF Can we get keyboard navigation on the main page without opening the links up and using arrow keys I like to browse with JK using Reddit Enhancement Suite and would just love to see that as a main feature with this new redesign And a dark theme Please Not sure where I should ask this Hopefully someone can help Ive just been invited to join a reddit group by someone who has been a Redditor for  day and has  karma Probably getting ready to spam me so how can I report this as suspect behaviour You forgot removing detailed vote counts Im still not happy about that Fuck uspez Hopefully you make it so anything you can do on a PC you can do on a mobile device WHY can you not block certain subs on mobile but can on PC WHY do you have to login to a PC to toggle NSFW subs These are stupid design decisions or they are lazy Please at least the first one blocking unwanted subs needs to happen itll be better for everyone Sadly there are no real improvements on Reddit Theres SO much that can be done Its software it doesnt take  years to implement a specific user feature It should take a few months The video hosting is pretty terrible Not something Id be proud of as a software developer  heres something ive wanted to know how is reddit a business how does it make money Question from the first comment thread by uschwarzwield I want to ping ucharlieb and say how amazed I am that you commented on that first post again four years later This comment will probably get buried but the new subreddit search on mobile sucks ass FUCK YOU FOR BANNING rgundeals They launched commenting The first comment fittingly was about how comments are going to ruin Reddithttpswwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsredditnowsupportscommentsc You are famous ucharlieb Yeah im probably gonna end up using RES to stick with the old theme Not a fan of change so Ill just go down

there before subreddits Redesign is horrible What were you thinking I want classic version Thats what every site gets on a redesign Used the new design for one or already two weeks daily Today I went back to the old With RES the current old one is much better I couldnt even visit nsfw subreddits anymore how boring for whatever reason the above button didnt work UPDATE  Thanks to all the

Awards here As mentioned above mod teams can participate by creating a set of six Community Awards that exemplify the culture of your community and replying to this comment with the name of your community Were putting  Coins into the Community Bank of  random entries reddit is getting weird This is getting kinda ridiculous This just sounds like giving you guys money with extra steps MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS MORE I cant wait for the drama the first time a mod embezzles community coins by spending them on awards for their alt account I assume that at the very least mods cant give mod awards to themselves Why is the tax so exorbitant If I want my buddy to have Platinum I spend  coins whatever If I want a sub I like sub to be able to buy somebody platinum it costs  coins Thats over  Well no its exactly  but holy shit man an  tax This is a more shameless cash grab than silver not to mention renaming gold to confuse people and raising prices across the board I really hope nobody falls for this This seems just as useless as silver While the concept sounds good Im concerned that this will reward already large communities while smaller ones will be left in the dust Is there a way to get smaller rewards or have costs scale based on the number of subscribers in subreddits   Awards can be priced between  Coins and  Coins  coins For a shitty little icon next to a post that you can barely see translation  for a shitty little icon next to a post that you can barely see Fuck outta here with this horseshit and garbage monetization practices you deplorable admins So you took Reddit silver a fun meme that people did for free and then charged people for it and now you want more of that with new names ah more shitty additions to pile on i cant wait for whatever it is that inevitably replaces reddit to get popular Doesnt this just destroy the awards hierarchy Why not just replace gold with the new icons instead of having it alongside it I noticed the other day that you can see how much reddit server time any given subreddits gildings have bought Simply click on a gilding icon of any kind while on the main subreddit page and it takes you to all the gildings on that subreddit with a note at the top telling you how much server time the subreddit has paid for rpics alone has paid for  years of reddit server time Can we expect to see the additional funds from these new arbitrary gilding options to go towards anything meaningful or is it just profit for profits sake Cuz I cant help but notice that despite having presumably hundreds of years of server time paid for the sites actual functionality hasnt notably improved with all this extra money coming in and Im kinda curious where its going Community Awards are available to public SFW nonbanned nonquarantined communities Seems unfair for the amateur porn subreddits where the users spend a fuckload of money buying coins to reward their favorite noods posters deleted Maybe Im in the minority here but I find these community awards absolutely useless With the standard  awards their is a clear hierarchy But with the community awards especially when a post gets popular all of them just kinda blend together and ultimately become meaningless Nobodys going to look through a dozen awards that all look pretty much the same with all those lowres tiny icons at most just eyeball the total amount To quote myself from the original thread on this I dont understand what advantage this has over having communityspecific sprites for silver gold and platinum Platinum has benefits gold has benefits silver is cheap communityspecific award has   I gathered from this post httpswwwredditcomrredesigncommentscpsbgcommunityawardseverythingyouneedtoknow that you might be able to set them to  coins For roughly the reddit silver price this seemed amazing as it meant there was a cheap award that actually had a benefit to it the benefit being that subs would gather coins to then use for ModExclusive Awards Hearing this possibly isnt going to happen is hugely disappointing and it looks like its something only the top subs will really benefit from and in a way punish the small and medium size subs for not being able to offer such a community benefit uShaneH  Moderators will now have the ability to give ModExclusive Awards to recognize users for highquality content that is representative of their community Im sure this will not lead to any disagreements where users and janitors hold different opinions Hasnt this already been a thing in rnba for a while  coins That can buy a lot of nothing with that EDIT What the hell is even that Just create a reddit turd award Thats what people will spend money on Needlessly going out of their way to show petty contempt to strangers deleted It helps give Redditors a sense of Pride and Accomplishment Why are NSFW subs excluded Youre putting them on the same level as banned and quarantined subs for no specific reason Also how would community awards even on work on banned subs if they werent excluded  What are the benefits of community awards Dollar dollar bills yall for Reddit I guess Reddits list of priorities is a dartboard Gee I love virtual currency thats worth shit The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race FlwqpadAACoJkLNOEOCX Im betting  months until Reddit starts offering to let users buy karma Now that I have your attention I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders lets at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity not because they were seeking asylum Whether or not they should be deported is debatable but lets at least stop with the falsehood that most of them are asylum seekers Such pointless bullshit This seems really fucking stupid This is fucking stupid Are you doing anything to stop power mods from moderating hundreds of subs Imagine actually thinking this is cool Wtf is this  You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver Gold and Platinum Nope I filtered out the page element that contains them because theyre pointless and distracting deleted Awesome Another way for people with unpopular opinions to be even more ostracized while people that tow the status quo can be showered in flair and attention What an awful fucking idea Reddit Small and medium sized communities do not have a large enough user base to use these awards You need to implement this on a smaller scale for those subs unless youre throwing a bone to rfunny and raskreddit without caring about subs like rwiiu and thousands of other small subs But do I get a participation award for commenting tldr please spend money in this site were in debt to the Chinese and those Triad mother fuckers are going to smash our knee caps This is dumb at least let NSFW posts have them too deleted Chasing Facebook deleted No I dont think I will Stop bloating Reddit with useless garbage I dont get it Hey guys Were here to introduce the cool new way to give us your money in exchange for small and useless emoticons on comments you make Ew What is this now kindergarten I fucking hate what this site is becoming This is the microtransaction model applied to social media preying on peoples social connectedness to use social pressure to normalize paying money for useless digital goods This is the type of coercive online scam that really needs to be regulated by governments And unfortunately with the reality of reddits commenting system this comment will hardly ever be seen httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxNjICGkb Lets go back to just gold I was kinda excited but that didnt last given that these are now pretty much silver but way more expensive I dont see the point okay if someone spends  there should be some actually good rewards  is  months of Reddit premium when converted to platinum Any sane person would prefer that to a lil badge on their post Please just explain why you think anyone in their right mind shouldwould buy one of these Max tier awards Edit Reddit the absolute madlads gave me the  coin award I complained about Something that no one asked for that sounds overly complicated and stupid Not impressed Reddit is hot garbage award Cool Now add subreddit blocking so that we can block subreddits we dont want to appear on our feed I cant wait to see how this back fires Another award Ill never win deleted Reddit  year from now Weve started selling Karma for your convenience and eNjOyMeNt When did EA take over Reddit Ah yes the the classic award award This is absolutely retarded This is both useless  will most definitely end in tears What a terrible attempt at continuing to Facebookafy Reddit This is so fucking stupid lol Yeah more participation trophies Just what this sub needs Will you still give communities Reddit gold or whatever it is now for annual awards or will they need to pull from the community Bank for those Mods should keep the golden toasters and jump into a bath with them Admins too Oh thank goodness I was hoping for another way to spend money on reddit s Hooray more microtransactions I like chocolate milk Cool just stop the stupid redesign Cool seems dumb Just stop Why no community awards for NSFW communities Admins should spend their time getting rid of all the corrupt mods not worrying about making awards Is there an award for not caring You are a joke Why are you turning this place into a race to post the most nonsense Any award I see will be downvoted regardless of content I hope others do the same Fucking lame Why not do something actually cool and put the money earned from coins toward an ocean charity Oh wait I forgot this place is a corporate shit hole now that only cares about sucking profit from its users Are there size and resolution requirements for award images Thanks I hate it rTIHI This is getting stupid Are you guys just pushing a button labeled Shit no one asked for Introducing fuck you go die in a fire So this is more like a participation medal Cash grab What a waste of money Can I trade it in for real money That would get me to try to get some of those coins God I wish Reddit would die already Milking it for all you can eh Whens the next thing coming What a load of bullshit gamification by Reddit Whats next Cooldowns Loot boxes Reddit is no longer down the shitter It has gone through the sewers out into the ocean into the mouth of sea slugs and shitted back out Yea fuck all this I see that NSFW communities are not able to participate what about quarantined communities Just more rewards for karma whoring imo Cool Now add subreddit blocking so that we can block subreddits we dont want to appear on our feed Fuck off Spez award A He looks like a knockoff Anthony Michael Hall and B Go fuck yourselves Awesome More hive mind follower rewards to curb outside the box thinking Go conformity I have no desire to monetarily enrich a company that lies about its support for free speech while it continually censors political content and increasingly discriminates against NSFW communities with feature development Gold as a donationish model made sense when reddit was an open source startup with strong values and mostly independent funding But now youve taken half a billion in VC money from the past few years why are you still assuming your users want to donate as they did in the past If reddit can find its backbone on freedom of speech again then I will find my wallet Until then I can only offer scorn and condemnation for what you have done to a once great platform in the search for profit How about you deal with Mods and Powermods abuse of privileges STOP quarantining subreddits left and rightfree speech No stop silencing conservative subs and actually put a stop to Age Play subs that are clearly just safe havens for pedophiles Can anyone at Reddit take care of this Or are you all incapable Tell China to go sit on a dick we dont need or want that type of oversight and censoring I dare you to reply and address the issues presented Edit Once again no Mod wants to step up to the plate Still running scared or incapable of addressing these issues which I brought up in the last nonsensical announcement post So for one month of giftable reddit premium  coins people need to spend  coins    or  in community awards and only community awards I understand that you guys are trying to make a profit here but isnt that a bit overpriced Id be interested to know how the  community bank figure was picked It does seem exceedingly low I really like the idea and was looking forward for this feature but Id love to have the freedome of setting the award value by ourself Those awards are really expensive and  cost even more than platinum Who will ever spend  or even  coins for an award of which most of the user wont even recognize how valuable it is I mean k Can I convert community awards to tendies  ATTENTION GROUP MASTURBATION STARTS IN  MINUTES  When will you ban rpolitics for promoting terrorism this is gay You are the cringiest most degenerate nerds on planet Earth God reddit is so fucking gross Pineapple does belong on pizza when will you ban hate subreddit FragileWhiteRedditor for blatant racism Oh I dont see this thing horribly awry and becoming an embezzlement scheme Stop making powers for petty tyrants The fuck are you thinking Who cares Its just a trick to get people to spend Hard pass Maybe if this place didnt remove subs that shouldnt have been removed I wouldnt think this but no thanks BTW the awards section wont load for me in rTeefers Please look into this Yeah theres some in rImsorryjon I love the new surprise mechanics Werent these introduced like two months ago Virtual currency Im waiting for the next update to say Reddit has now implemented surprise mechanics for cosmetic communities badges Some are rare during charity pledges There is no way that this will be abused lol Reddit will give everyone loot box I mean surprise mechanics for cosmetic add on for your reddit profile snoo avatar Its not necessary but we at reddit have found that surprise mechanics  loot boxes  is predatory but the profit is insane Give it enough time and reddit will learn from EA Why the fuck did some lad spend  worth of coins for a picture of Spez Fuck off In  years time reddit is gonna be one of those shitty chinese offbrand mtx filled apps that only kids install because adults know better I would really like an award May I have one please So theyre pretty useless just like silver and you have to pay money for the mods to reap the benefits and all you get in return is a tiny ass icon besides your username Seems like a winwin situation for all s The time machine worked Its April Fools Day But seriously this is a terrible idea and we all know this is just to get more money in for Reddit If an actual service or something was given in exchange for these awards rather than just essentially throwing your money into some tiny digital art then it would be all good But its not like that Ive only just started getting a little used to the silver and plat awards and now we have badges that can cost  credits If anyone at all can properly defend this change with a good explanation preferably an admin please do I really struggle to see how this doesnt hurt Reddit in the long run Great cash grab With this new system maybe in the future reddit wont have to show Chinese propaganda to get money Good work Calling subreddits communities is so fetch deleted Cool now mods can focus the echo chamber even further by bringing yet more focus to the posts they approve of Oh god mods are getting more power and another tool to push their personal bullshit The same people that closes posts because the comments dont support their view or because people are having a real discussion but YaLl CaNt BeHaVe That sounds really fuckin lame This will just increase the circlejerking in every damn front page sub even more So can you do something about the big Nazi subreddits like TD already instead of these updates Who the fuck will buy any of that shit Coins Nice Hi there uvenkman I went to create Community Awards for rsushi but nothing is popping up The only thing I see when on the Community Award page is the short description of what Community Awards are There is no option to create awards Edit Heres httpsimgurcomapzCHl what I see on the Community Awards Page Whats the prize I have already joined VID Bounty Campaign cuz they are giving away k to all Bounty Winners If your prize isnt more than that then it isnt worth participating httpsbountyvidcamera rdodgethewhoooosh The link wont work but its a actual subreddit Dont mind me Im just commenting before the comments are disabled for this post httpswwwsoarshservicebuyredditupvotes Lol karma Why cant we create multiple awards for each cost Id like to use some funny ones and serious ones at say  coins The setup now only allows for one for each coin amount No Please unquarantine rwaterniggas The sub is literally just for enthusiasts of water I figure a water bottle award would be fun but the sub is ineligible just because of the name Its good to see you havent changed a bit and put NSFW subs on the same tier as fatpeoplehate and thedonald Hilarious A golden toaster is what my uncle bathed with Interesting to note that the national security Canary in the  transparency report is no longer present in the  transparency report  DMCA takedown requests in  months thats much lower than I would have guessed And only  of those requiring content to be taken down was also a pleasant surprise Id be very interested in reading some court documents that contain things like  nbsp We began our enhanced interrogation

to tell a lie nor am I the type to hurt you deleted   What is thishttpspastebincomGuViF In  reddit didnt give out any information when requested by non US government bodies In  it did despite still being a US company Were those disclosures legal obligations or reddit simply willingly disclosing information Also what is an emergency request Edit as is mentioned in a lower comment the gag canary is no longer present in this years report Thats not the sort of thing that would have been accidently been omitted deleted So how do we know youre being transparent about how you built this report I think we need a Transparency Report Transparency Report I can see right through your report deleted How should I respond when I get PMs of users requesting me to take down posts that I posted Also how should I respond when a user contacts me as a mod requesting to take down a postcomment  Last time you updated policies it included this linehttpsarchiveisRHzRx We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements rules or other Reddit policies or to protect the rights property and safety of ourselves and others How many times have you divulged users private information due to reddits beliefs  In  we did not produce records in response to  of government requests Im curious what kind of requests were made in which you did provide records Im just confused why  what would it take to make both a government say We want to know about uMrLegilimens but also what would make you say Yes or no  India We received  requests from cyber crime investigation authorities in India requesting the removal of content which was allegedly disturbing public order None were complied with with a majority of the content not being hosted by Reddit However the table just above this says  posts and  user account were affected What does that mean In what ways can postsusers be affected if requests arent complied with uspez  the form you link to in Law Enforcement Guidelines  Emergency Disclosure Requests requires authorization to view Thats probably not intentional I think there needs to be some post about awareness of peoples posts hereI was an analyst for the USG and I can tell you that  of information collected about an individual is done so legally and without the knowledge of social media platforms or companies I understand that people like to see these reportsbut they really dont matter The integrity of reddit when cooperating with authorities is far less important than what you actuallyand very publiclypost on reddit A bit meta  have you been gagged by governments in regards to certain information requests In other words is everything in this report or almost everything RIP canary This comment has been overwritten by an

and hit the new OVERWRITE button at the top uspez Reddit complied with only  of Russian takedown notices seems like that figure is off given you mentioned there were  other duplicate requests as well Edit if there were  requests  were complied with and those  had  duplicates thats either  or  complied with depending on how you slice it So thats either  or  certainly not  As an Australian I thank you for responding to requests from our government by telling them to go fuck themselves I see you complied to two takedown requests due to defamation though Those probably came from Tony Abbott because hes a bigeared moneygrubbing douchecanoe with a history of misogynistic intimidation and no respect for the Australian public All of the above is verifiably true and therefore not classifiable as defamation Do you also hand out the passwords of the user accounts requested by the governments or are they encrypted I personally use the same password for reddit and all my games steam guild wars so im wondering if i should start using different passwords haha So did you guys just stop posting to rchillingeffects or has there really not been a takedown request in  months Who the fuck gilds the CEO of reddit man I see no canary on the report for  httpscanarywatchorgreddit deleted Things like this really show how any online company should be handling user information I also think that Mods everywhere deserve a shoutout for doing their own policing of content keeping this as a place where free ideas can be spread without the government having to get involved Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation With the apparent censorship and generally bad behavior from mods I dont really feel this is true anymore Add to that the shills rampant vote manipulation and the doubt grows substantially This is great that Reddit publishes this information thanks So Russia seems to be trying to gradually block all of reddit Stop them before its too late Also fun to see that US emergency requests are often not granted I know you cant show users impacted but could you show subreddits that were impacted Eg if a comment was posted to a particular subreddit Fuck off NSA Is there a way to sticky announcement posts to rall Right now this isnt even on the front page and I would hate for someone to miss it just because its never in their line of sight In contrast to the response to most admin postshttpsgfycatcomAngelicShockingHerculesbeetle The square root of Chuck Norris is pain Do not try to square Chuck Norris the result is death I wonder what percentage of requests for full user info that were complied with were accompanied by an order to not alert the user to the request Is this the Reddit April Fools joke of the year Appreciate the effort Thank you for doing this it is very much appreciated Transparency is so important especially on such an open and diverse community like reddit and it doesnt go unnoticed bring back the vote counters no one cares about your opacity report Its a safe bet to say the NSA or FBI or someone in the government is reading this thread carefully I have a message for the lowlife shithead spending his time reading Reddit posts and feeling important about his job fuck off Fuck right the fuck off If you dont believe in what youre doing then grow a set of balls and get a new job If you do believe youre doing important work and youre helping to protect the nation from enemies foreign and domestic well you wouldnt have so many enemies if you didnt fucking spy on everyone all the god damn time Fuck right the fuck off you low life piece of shit fat disgusting slob who has accomplished nothing in life and whos kids will grow to resent them and wife will leave them To make sure my comment gets flagged by the

Persons BPjM to remove the contents of a subreddit rwatchpeopledie NO YOU DID NOT The BPjM requested that you give a statement regarding rwatchpeopledie as to potential harm it could have for youth as someone kicked off procedure with them and they had to investigate Tell us your opinion regarding whats that about not block this You reddit are the only censors here Most the BPjM would have could have done after due consideration which likely wouldve been nonharmful as rwatchpeopledie deals mostly with news is to make Google Germany remove that subreddit and that subreddit only not the whole of reddit from search results That is the maximum extent of their power They cannot do any more Same thing already applies to gazillions of NSFW the naked kind subreddits You reddit are the only censors here Tons of people have explained the situation again and again to you and you still refuse to not be stupid Have you ever tried to use the search function Hello marty you are now banned from rnoadmins Welcome Did you reddit before now or did you just make this account so we wouldnt find your rgonewild posts Who was the previous CTO was there one lol you said weiner Would you ever change your first initials to IC and order for pizza delivery whats a cto Is it ok if I call you Weens That grocery list app is there a way to make it like cloud based or something where when I type something on it it will update on my wifes phone as well It would stop a lot of fights in my house Thanks Weens Your last name is Weiner and you chose that as your introduction photo It practically photoshops a penis into itself Will the approach to stopping spam and excessive selfpromotion remain primarily reactive and Sisyphean despite there being lowhanging fruit approaches to preventing much of it Welcome How is it that a top  web property throws multiple over capacity errors every single day Whats different about reddits infrastructure that makes it so unreliable against its peers Has it just been a lack of spending on capacity BTW I just wanted to let you know that I became CTO purely for the comment karma And whats this I hear about not getting karma for self posts Recommendations for a D printer How well defined are the different positions CEO COO CTO etc at Reddit Do you all just sort of work together as a team or are you really separate with resourcesprojects you try to develop Hiya Marty You poor bastard Real quick can you make a list of unrealistic goals that we can hold you to in six months Ill start  Subreddit Tags  Id love to be able to sort and filter by tags so that when football rolls around I can completely clean my feed of anything FOOTBALL related  Friends  Theres no way that I can discover new content my friends value except when they comment and if they arent especially prolific Id like to see a list of things that my friends enjoyed perhaps by their upvotes as well as places they commented  Personal Tags  While I already REStag certain people with Fuckwit  Argues for the sake of Arguing and so on Id like to be able to see comments that are considered Funny or Clever or Informative and so on  Please let us tag stories with Misinformation and Deceptive Clickbait Bullshit then you guys in the background increase the amount of upvotes the serving domains require before the story gets frontpaged For example if Gawker gets the reputation for serving up inaccurate bullshit maybe they need  upvotes to equal  This will lower the incidence of the front page being nothing but inaccurate shit Just a few thoughts Welcome aboard How did you become the new CTO Are you concerned Tyrell Wellick is going to sleep with your wife and blackmail you so he gets the job This articlehttpthenextwebcominsiderredditpicksuppinterestssecondemployeeascto says that the most important aspect of Weiners work at Pinterest may have been the strides he made as the leader of the companys spam and abuse prevention team known internally as the Black Ops team As you know reddit has a little bit of a censorship scare right now and lots of users are worried that some opinions are quietly and not so quietly being censored by being incorrectly labelled as abuse Do you the antiabuse Black Ops guy have anything to say that will calm us down a bit Hey uMartd  whats reddits policy on hiring felons Im  caught a felony marijuana distribution charge when I was  in Philly PA where marijuana is now decriminalized ironically I had just started living on my own and grew a few pot plants I sucked at it though and they died my roommate throws a party one day and the cops are called in they come as soon as they smell pot they find the dead plants and Im stuck as a felon Im in the middle of expunging my record long process I currently work as an IT infrastructure Engineer man I love that title so fancy at an engineering firm specializing in solutions for secure environments Ive been with the company since I finished college Its a challenging job that I absolutely love but the east coast is wearing thin on me itll always be home but I wanna spread my wings a bit Should I even bother applying Whats reddits policy on the matter That last name If things go wrong hes gonna have one hell of a time Theres a rule that says that you cant only submit links of your own content even if you make your own subreddit for it yet PewDiePie has his own subreddit and a bot that does just that Its clearly stated that doing this is against the rules So why is PewDiePie granted this privilege and not other users of Reddit  EDIT Forgot to mention I messaged moderators of Reddit about this and they said to just report it to rspam People have already done this and the bot was never banned There are many other YouTubers that do this sort of thing as well  EDIT Wasnt expecting this big of a response Ill give some specifics httpwwwdailydotcombusinessredditspamrulesoriginalcontent httpswwwredditcomwikiselfpromotion And the specific sentence in question If you run a subreddit that is only your own content or your own links thats not okay and seen as linkfarming or using reddit for SEO deleted Hello Marty Id like to ask a couple of questions Firstly do you have any previous experience with Reddit use and with the various Reddit communities Basically is this your first account or just your official admin one Secondly as the new CTO what areas of development are you planning to focus on How much is your focus going to be on new features fixing old ones focussing on mod tools or improving the Reddit API etc Finally why are you building RD when clearly as an admin you now work for the Empire P Anyway good luck Nothing you do will ever satisfy everyone and every decision you make will enrage large parts of your userbase Welcome to Reddit When I first arrived back at Reddit one of the first things I learned is that we were in desperate need for more technical leadership and the first person we reached out to was Marty He has the perfect combination of qualities we want in a CTO He has impressive technical chopshttpwwwinfoqcompresentationsPinterest experience growing a team through many phases taking Pinterest from  to  engineers very thoughtful opinions on company culture but dont ask him about them unless youve got some time and a long history on Reddit he may replace his brother Zachhttpswwwredditcomumrweiner as the most significant Weiner You didnt murder your competitions wife did you What are you looking to accomplish at reddit Will you please bring back the upvotedownvote count Please deleted Do you have a degree in dank memes Marty This is important Hi and welcome Care to elaborate and describe your role as CTO or at least your interpretation of it and your hopes and intentions moving forward Have some lunch meat Mr Weiner httpmimgurcomgPyS  If you are interested in joining our engineering team please head over to redditcomjobs Are salary negotiations still banned Hey Marty Will you be posting videos of the Reddit data center like you did at PinteresthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvJBbdnkuNs How do you deal with people in the office calling you Farty Weiner How exactly will the quarantine subs work Opt inopt out prior to logging in Any chance there will be a way to block specific users or subreddit members from PMing you On the topic of PM harassment how would you feel about a button that either party could press to allow a PM to be read by Reddit admins It would open just that PM thread and only to admins along with a note about why it was forwarded Sorry if something like that is already available I just figure its better than taking images that can be altered and it allows admins to follow along if the harassment continues from one user Thanks for the update Is it too early to ask what the alternative to shadowbanning will be A block or tarpit by IPTor maybe You say quarantine the communities you dont wish to support but how will this affect communities that are borderline questionable but still serious in their communication re brigading I think a good step would be to actually inform the users somehow that its a bannable offense uInfamouslyUnknownhttpswwwredditcomrvideoscommentseuqwfredditautoshadowbanningctitec put it better than I could  Not only youre using the site as designed the site doesnt even inform you its punishable  And Im not talking about the nature of shadowban Im talking about brigading itself This rule is completely unwritten Its not in site rules its not in user agreement its not even in the goddamn reddiquette Theres no clear official source where even an unusually diligent new user could find out this is forbidden yet you can get the worst punishment for it there is Its ridiculous You mentioned an Android app are you looking to go down the same path you did with Alien Blue and purchaseteam with a current app or will this be homegrown based on the Alien Blue platform Does antiabuse and antiharassment will mean that admins and mods would be able to read your PMs There have been quite a few scripted bots and spammers showing up lately and with increasing frequency Are there plans to make it more difficult for them to operate How about clarifying what consitutes a brigade before working on your antibrigade measures Is rbestof a brigade I know that its their policy to not vote on topics they link to but I highly doubt that everyone in the sub knows about that I had a  year old account shadowbanned before I was even aware of what brigading was I strongly feel it was the content type I was involved in brigading that had a role in my banning deleted  AlienBlue bug fixes  AlienBlue improvements Thanks Will the rules be open for discussion with the community at large or will it be solely developed and delivered by Reddit leadership Thanks for the update I appreciates being able to see behind the curtain I just have a few questions  Are there any hard deadlines for any of these changes Projected ETAs other then ASAP  Is there a place like a dedicated subreddit that we can tune into to see progress or maybe offer support when needed Community developed tools that have become official come to mind  And on that note can we as the community do anything to enhance our corner of the Internet with you and the Admin team I just wanted to say thanks for making that course on web app dev on Udacity a while back It was the only course on that site I managed to get through This one httpswwwudacitycomcoursewebdevelopmentcs deleted Please please please coordinate with moderators re brigading We have had users from rfitnesscirclejerk getting banned for brigading rfitness It is ridiculous especially since the mods of both subs have tried to stop the bans Seriously If the mods of both subreddits say it is okay dont come in and ban our users deleted Id love to see a You are banned for reason here Instead of just not knowing at all I feel like that post from a user that talked about being unable to talk to anyone for near a year because he was shadow banned So he kept commenting and no one listened  Kinda scary if you think about it Please dont make this a horror movie Reddit Admins Whats brigading The vote normalization algorithm is terrible it severely skews the historic data towards low turnover subreddits with content that gains votes over a long period of time For example according to rall sorted by top for this year this is by far and away the most upvoted submission on reddit httpswwwredditcomrmontageparodiescommentsiyswhenyouupvotedownvoteyounowgetahitmarker  votes Wow that must be a super important post wait its from a subreddit Ive never heard of and its a simple CSS change While our recent Stephen Hawking AMA in rscience httpswwwredditcomrsciencecommentseretscienceamaseriesiamstephenhawking  votes So reddit finds simple CSS hacks  times more interesting than an AMA with Stephen Hawking I watched the Hawking AMA hit  votes at least  times and get dropped back to  I understand there are some issues with the vote growth and what not but votes dont mean anything any more even worse they mean less than nothing they are misleading This really needs to be changed we need tog ive up on preserving the historic top list which is gone by the way unless you believe rBlackPeopleTwitter twitter is the shining gem of reddit and look to the future Or just remove sorting by top entirely Spez questions  Can we bring back the upvotesdownvotes on a post It sucks seeing something that could have tons of upvotes AND downvotes be pushed down the page purely because people dont agree Controversial comments are a great conversation starter Eliminating the ability to view both the upvotes and downvotes makes Reddit into more of a popularity contest than a place for great debate  Banning doesnt work Temporary suspensions do If you ban someone they have no incentive to play nice or to behave They instead just create a new account The idea that someone should be censored FOR ALL ETERNITY because they pissed of a mod is really stupid There is already a good android app I really like Reddit is Fun why not join with its developer and improve it Morning Spez So what exactly does quarantining communities you dont want to support mean What is going to be done about the new bot being developed by moderators with the purpose of harassing people based on where they have posted before Here is an archive of the list of users they plan to ostracize httpsarchiveiszwgj This clearly falls under the definition of groupmass harassment Reddit is still losing prominent employeeshttpwwwusatodaycomstorytechredditemployeeleaves working directly in areas which your post suggests Reddit is working on Whats up with that And why no hiring announcements Thanks for the update Official npreddit would help with the antibrigading things  not just redirecting to a different CSS but to a completely stripped down page would discourage a lot of infiltrations And filters like rworldnews has them as a redditinternal feature would also be great The latter right now dont affect the frontpage which many people see as an argument against them plus they would help curb controversies over the prevalence of some topics in subs like reurope Neat Im interested to see what sort of drama arises from this What did you have for breakfast I saw this job listing the other dayhttpsjobslevercoredditacebaaefe does that mean you guys are restoring the AMA coordinator position  Quarantine the communities we dont want to support What exactly do you mean by Quarantine Are there specific guidelines to being a supported community Is there any way to fix it so that if you delete your own post from a subreddit it doesnt count against you Its really annoying to draft a long post for a new subreddit post it then the minute you post it realize you screwed up one tiny subreddit rule in the title of the post so you delete your post and fix the mistake only to be flagged by the system as a spammer and it doesnt let you repost am I the only one that has this issue All these fancy tools for mods are nice and all but when do the users get to have a means to fight back against mods who are abusing their powers Because that would be a legitimately good change that is needed far more than any of this bullshit I really dont get reddits current obsession with brigading By its very design reddit is a brigading machine ie The Digg Effect is now known as The Reddit Effect Why is it okay to share a link to FoxNewscom and overwhelm them with reddit users but its not okay to share a link to rfoxnews and overwhelm them with reddit users Its really hypocrisy in the highest order However that isnt to say that reddit is not nor should not be a forum of both global as well as niche subs that may only want input from established community members The only antibrigading measures I believe should be implemented are tools that only permit subscribers actions once they have met certain requirements For instance you could allow mods to stipulate that people can only vote on items in their sub after their comments have received a specified amount of karma There are many many ways this could be broken down and many subs may want different ways to limit participation For instance one sub may want to prevent users from submitting links until theyve acquired a specified amount of comment karma on that sub Other subs may want to restrict users from commenting unless theyve already submitted a successful link Further Id also say a stipulation where subs that do have karma requirements should not be included in rall rall should be all submissions where everyone can voice and vote their opinion unrestricted of participation Spez seven years ago you made this commet in regards to hatesubs as seen here xhttpswwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsmacanwebanthisextremelyracistassholeckd Why the recent change in policy Would the Android app be a reworking of the AMA app or will this be an entirely new design Why was rtalesoffathate banned a few days ago So when you say you are going to change things regarding antibrigading does that mean you are trying to find a way to enforce that policy without the ridiculous contrivance of saying that following a posted link from one thread to another is somehow brigading and I shouldnt participate until I do something stupid and arbitrary like copy and paste the link so that I can wander in naturally If someone links a thread which happens a million times a day I should be able to participate in that thread if I want That isnt brigading its just using your website the way it is designed  Unlike you work for me doesnt consist of screwing around on Reddit all day Strong sneak diss Unlike you work for me doesnt consist of screwing around on Reddit all day Rude If actual accounts are not supposed to get shadowbanned why is it still happening As the CEO cant you put an end to it immediately What is the Android app going to be like Will it be a clone of Alien Blue Why would you put effort into creating an all new android app instead of supporting reddit is fun the already prevalent app Heyo how has your morning been Can you define quarantine Do you mean remove these communities from Reddit Thanks for the update appreciated Are you gonna stop all brigading or let SRS still do their thing as they have so far Otherwise sounds good Hold up Wont all these changes mean less privacy for users To accomplish these things it sounds like more tracking of individual computers more collection of data on users and more retention of that data Part of the whole we want to be safe on Reddit calling is that we want to keep a separation between our Reddit identities and our real life identities If Reddit amps up its already sophisticated tracking and data collection wont that make us less safe I was shadowbanned for a little under a year and yeah it really did suck Every post every comment not a single upvote or downvote It made me feel like Reddit in general was a huge uncaring mass Then a friend tried to look me up my page wasnt there I messaged him on Reddit he didnt get it I messaged the admins from a new account I was caught up in the spam filter Honestly it really hurt my Redditing experience I hated the site for a while before I found out I was shadowbanned I hope it goes away soon it kinda ends up feeling like youre some kid being pushed down headfirst into the mud by the admins  Quarantine the communities we dont want to support What does this mean in general Does this mean that certain communities wont get support from the admins Or that they wont be allowed to link to other subs Certain subs have built in emote systems Will these be incorporated into the upcoming android app Elaborate on quarantine Does that mean theyre still accessible or shut down Android app But relay for reddit is so nice Just been having a quick look From the current version Your Private Information Is Never for Sale Certain third party sites may offer users the option to log in using their reddit id for example redditgifts This option is only an authentication tool and does not transmit any new personal information to or from reddit or give reddit access to details of subsequent actions taken on these sites httpswwwredditcomhelpprivacypolicyvaddeceabffc In the new version there seem to be no such guarantees about not selling user

httpswwwredditcomhelpprivacypolicyvecdaafafeaacebcaf Notice how they say they are updating the privacy policy rather than taking away your privacy Seriously guys Read them both Maybe Im just being cynical but it looks like a big fuck you to privacy Supporting Do Not Track is an interesting choice Itll be a big win for Do Not Track to have another major website following it Moving towards not actually storing IP addresses is also an interesting move I like that youre putting a strong emphasis on privacy Im also generally a fan of making it so that people can understand whats being tracked and why So are you still not storing comment edits That is are we still able to completely wipe a comment by editing it to something else and then deleting it Interesting Thanks for the Do Not Track option and for stating changes in the first place What kind of rd party analytics does reddit actually use uspez is there a TLDR for the policy as a whole Good job Reddit for being one of the only big websites to give a fuck about their users privacy I dont think people give Reddit enough credit for this kind of stuff Edit thanks for the gold Makes sense short and sweet I can get behind this But

personal information this is not protecting the users or reddit This is just a big fuck you to users I cannot believe you actually are forcing this down our throats this is an absolute disgrace and an insult to everyone trying to make reddit a better place  It says that reddit collects basically everything our browser gives you AKA our entire browser footprint Thats a pretty unique identifier is it

changes to the privacy policy is to allow the creepy annoying advertising The type that makes adblocking popular Why do you have removed the Your Private Information Is Never for Saleparagraphs So

browsing modes Is it different from nonprivate browsing deleted httpsimgurcomaDGKau liars deleted Is there a reason you reserve the right to reduce the level of privacy users have without asking them first What steps do you take if you reduce the privacy of users to ensure you dont reduce the privacy of users who have not accepted the new privacy policy This has to be a bloody joke You did NOT mention the important change regarding sale of private data that were even promised to be kept private indefinitely This is the pure opposite of transparency Youre throwing a red herring at us with the extension of IP storage but do not mention that You have to be fkidding me Also thank you uorangejulius and ucourtiebabe for reading drafts of the Policy deleted I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all eg with hashing but we still need to work out the details How exactly do you securely hash a  byte search space  We will not share sell or give away

they are going to be whoring themselves out to any government that asks and advertisers by selling your information for better targeted ads and you guys applaud their DNT policy Combined with the idiots that think its a good idea to kill the downvote button you have a fantastic facebook formula Individually you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy Notably browsers allow you to disable thirdparty cookies and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacyrelated extensions Were going to track everything you do and sell it to everybody for as much money as we can so if you dont want a Reddit colonoscopy secure your own damn computer Got it Thanks for the update Does rchillingeffects really show all takedown requests They seem way too infrequent for a site this big TURN OFF THE COOKIES BANNER HOLY SHIT THIS IS ANNOYING I see you talked a big game about being antidoxxing but can you uspez explain this  We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements rules or other Reddit policies or to protect the rights property and safety of ourselves and others Sorry buddy you dont get to pretend to be principled with such laughably broad clauses You dont get to pretend youre acting in anyones best interest but yourself Especially us reddit old timers  we know full well what a reddit rule is and we all know its something not written down unless you swallow the estrogenladen sperm of Alexis which I might note is a name typically afforded to multiple women with rape fantasies in my actual experience Just saying Despite this Steve I feel you are a more intelligent person than Alexis I get he was around from the beginning but sometimes out with the old and in with the new yknow I know the whole reddit boat is manned oooh gendered language with incompetents and the only reason this site ever had a semblance of a soul was because of Aaron Swartz Im good at reading people Steve WAKE UP STEVE Maybe perform some sort of hostile takeover or something mhm Im good at that sort of thing if you want tips If you want wisdom ask a diabolical motherfucker Shame about Aaron really he was a good guy Too bad he never met me hed still be alive Cant be both the hero and idealistic always tell people to never go that route Out of curiosity why arent the IP addresses encrypted and hashed already I imagine usernames and passwords are already treated like that so is it to computationally intensive to do so with IP addresses because dynamic ones change so frequently Or is it because you need them for location tracking I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy Notably browsers allow you to disable thirdparty cookies and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacyrelated extensions This cant be emphasized enough This should be a required class in high school or maybe even elementary school IMO Ive met too many people who think theyre being tracked illegally when in reality they just dont understand how their browsers work Thanks for being proactive in documenting changes to the privacy policy and keeping your users informed Other tech companies could take a hint from you Hashes on just IP addresses wont work At least not in IPvthe address space is small enough to generate a full hash map of it in pretty much every hash algorithm even if you use something very slow like bcrypt You only need to generate the set once Unless you change salts every quarter Which is still doubtful if its any help You can salt with the username itself or something But that pretty much counters the original purpose of being able to match Howdy Im curious if thirdparty addons RIF RES have to abide by any standards for privacy and handling of sensitive information Are there any guidelines for that or options that users can choose from within reddit itself that affects howwhat information is given to other apps which have access to reddits authentication Is there a way to get rid of that banner about agreement to the cookies I click I agree over and over and whenever I refresh the site it appears again  I think Ive accepted the terms of services about  times the past half hour Every time I open a new thread or reload the front page the fucking ookies help us deliver our Services By using our Services or clicking I agree you agree to our use of cookies Learn More shows up If all that has changed in the Privacy Policy is the IP retention span I dont have a problem with this For all the complaining done about censorship etc which I agree with Reddit has had a stellar record to date of maintaining user privacy Keep up the good work edit Wow Thanks for the gold Quite happy about the Do Not Track option if it actually accomplishes what you say then it will be a nice addition  If you have Do Not Track enabled we will not load any thirdparty analytics Ghostery and AdBlock Plus already see to that but I also very much appreciate the Do Not Track feature Steve could you please clarify your position on Alien Blue I paid for the app back before it was acquired by reddit And once in a while youright now for example you put ads in the app until there is an outrage Then rinse and repeat in a month I also bought the premium which was suppose to be your workaround this problem when you first acquired the app but Im still seeing ads in the app So basically what is this shit This is starting to feel like CISPA Thanks for clarifying the privacy policy spez Are you enjoying your time back at the helm Edit typo  By continuing to use redditcom you agree to the new privacy policy By reading this reply you agree to pay me a thousand bucks every week deleted Maybe Im misunderstanding the point but hashing IPs doesnt really accomplish anything since their are only  billion IPs childs play for any person with a decent graphics card to run through in a few minutes You cant really salt them either since you have no way to tie the salt to an IP right Or am I missing something uspez where do you draw the line between collecting information to improve the site and also giving the users the privacy they need deleted deleted Is it true that when you delete a comment it never really gets deleted Not related to the privacy policy but whats up with your forum selection clause  Any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to this user agreement in whole or in part shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without respect to its conflict of laws provisions We agree and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal court located in San Francisco County California And the forced arbitration clause prohibition on classactions and waiver of all warranties Youre selling the privacy policy in some persona of Look how chill we are Then you turn around and have extremely consumerunfriendly contracted terms of service Very notchill Theres a reason people like Elizabeth Warren are against arbitration agreements especially with waivers of classaction Youre basically trying to waive liability for any wrongdoing that you or employees down the road might do And if anything happens every redditor will be screwed Any way of getting rid of this cookies popup that appears every time on every page even if weve clicked I agree or is it messed up Cookies help us deliver our Services By using our Services or clicking I agree you agree to our use of cookies Learn More Is the privacy policy retroactive Like is the new privacy policy applicable to everything posted on the site including all content posted prior to Jan st  or does this new policy only apply to content posted when it becomes effective By discontinuing to use reddit after this period would that be an opt out of the new policy and it would not be applicable to that account and all content it has posted Are we tracked by account or by IP Could we opt out of the new policy by stopped use on one account and creating a new one under the new policy or would the old account still be linked via IP What is considered opting in to the new policy once it is effective will posting be required as acknowledgment of the new policy of will simply logging in trigger a opt in Will visiting the site from an IP linked to an account trigger an out in I would appreciate answers to these questions as it is vital to my decision on whether or not I continue to use this site Thank you  We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online lol ok Just want to get something off my chest please please please dont change Social media has been a huge force for change over the past few years but recently its becoming less about the user and more about the money Facebook isnt a social media platform anymore its an advertising channel Snapchat have started showing adverts and making people pay for useless addons Instagram and Twitter have loads of promoted or sponsored posts I just read tonight that Netflix are beginning to show adverts and the news from the digital marketing industry in which I work is that Whatsapp is the next big for marketinghttpdigitalmarketingmagazinecoukecommercedigitalmarketingthreewayswhatsappcanhelpecommercecompanies Its so frustrating to see these great platforms that we championed here on Reddit as a break from the traditional shite turning into the same faceless corporations that we were originally trying to get away from Please dont start seeing users as cash cows and view us as your raison detre This isnt particularly aimed at anything youve done recently I just dont want Reddit to become the new Daily Mail we are also beginning to roll out support for Do Not Track Awesome Good stuff I thought I had an important question to ask but I forgot So instead  What goes best on a sandwich  How goes the Android App We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online You mean unless we go against the circlejerk and get downvoted or shadow banned right Youre trying very hard to reearn trust I can appreciate that I would encourage you to communicate to your employees that integrity is worth its weight in gold and is one of the hardest things to recover once lost Please keep this in mind when making decisions that affect the users of this website and I think that in the end both sides can be happy with the way Reddit continues to grow Has a single change Reddit made turned out for the better I cant remember one Thisll be good Wonderful change I love that Do Not Track will be supported We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahaHAHAHAHahahhahaaomgHAHAHHAahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA wow thanks I really needed that We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online Uhh wut Can you do something about accounts that were created years ago and never used I want uwindbreaker among other usernames and it was created  years ago and never used Its not fair Have you been approached about selling user data and what do you currently share with rd parties if anything We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online  you guys remove any post regarding the TPP Reddit is far from open We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online yeah sure buddy more data harvesting more data being sent to local law enforcement folks its time to pull the plug on reddit just as people pulled the plug on digg Thats nice but I dont really see how hashing ip addresses would be very effective More for show Im guessing deleted How do you measure usage across time Do you track navigation across the platform or just the votescommentspostssavessubscriptions Please direct your questions and comments to the post in rredditsecurity herehttpswwwredditcomrredditsecuritycommentsbletrrhowtokeepyourredditaccountsafe Congratulations on being unbanned from rNoAdmins Getting off reddit to spend time with familyI wish I could do that blink twice if they are making you say this udays is married to recently let go Reddit employee ukickme When she says shes leaving to spend time with my family it sounds like a tongueincheek you fired my husband so I certainly wont be seeing him at work Also this is awkward Bye All of you thanking her for revealing her reasons to quell your speculations just need to stop speculating in the first place udays is passiveaggressively telling us we should get off reddit and spend time with our families Nice try mom I was not aware of your existence until just now but I wish you the best in your new endeavors So longby the way who are you again Okay but how can we best turn this into drama But seriously good luck wherever you go Whats your favorite memory of your time at Reddit  So they fire ukickme and now udays steps down Enjoy time with your family and I wish you luck in your future As for ukrispykrackershttpswwwredditcomukrispykrackers isnt this a terrible news She has terrible history of engaging in passiveaggressiveness toward reddit users and I believe is a ban happy admin deleted I wish you and ukickme well The two of you made a difference in a lot of lives on the planet Your legacy the two of you is positive and joyful RedditGifts may continue but to me it will be the Christmas Inc version rather than the Santa version Youre out Im out Do enjoy a Christmas with family without work The two of you helped me find the Christmas spirit again personally and I comfortably celebrate it locallyamongst family rather than handing over hundreds of dollars to the postal companies I didnt realize ukrispykrackers notorious for being dismissive of the community could be called perfect for the Head of Community position Edit Hmmm I was just being cheeky but thanks for the gold Now Im on a list somewhere  When uspez asked if I had anyone in mind there was only one person I thought of ukrispykrackers fuck Wait are we serious here Can everyone please be reminded that ukrispykrackers was the admin who banned this poor guyhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscbomweapologizecsuxe and then responded by citing her personal lifehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentscbomweapologizecsum and said verbatim I was very busy and emotional from being torn from my family Please  The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them Titles post with the song the family in the Sound of Music sang to cheerily escape from the Nazis because they didnt want to be drafted into the party RiiiiiiiighthttpmediagiphycommediajeXizRAvzXgiphyfacebooksjpg Its really a shame that in technologydriven industries the best way to achieving worklife balance these days seems to be leave the job The CFO of Google retired a few months back for the same reason  he put it very bluntly worklife balance simply cannot be reached while working in our multinational technology environments Its a very sad characteristic for the world of information and technology to have But definitely a big positive that youre choosing the life side of the equation and as big as your contribution to Reddit has been itll probably be dwarfed by the impact to your family when youre able to enjoy your time more with them Best of luck and Merry early Christmas Good luck Will you still be involved as a moderator for rsecretsanta and relves or were those tied to your position as Head of Community But more importantly which member of the Von Trapp family are you ELIdays The number of Admins that left reddit in the past year I feel like I am watching a Suspense Horror movie where character after character disappears mysteriously and nobody knows who is behind all that Thank you for teaching me just now what the hell those kids in The Sound Of Music were saying all these years httpiimgurcomRuiNYqjpg I dont give a shit about reddit politics Dont care about Ellen Pao dont care about Victoriagate dont care about the newold CEO Ive never heard of days and certainly havent heard any rumors about her But theres someone with admin flair on my front page explaining that I should ignore some scandal I havent heard about because she is only resigning to be with her family Is this post specifically designed to make me interested in what nefarious things are going on behind the scenes Because I didnt think that was possible but youve got me a little curious Okay Im going to be that guy Left to spend more time with family is pretty much Washington DC speak for left to prevent a scandal Now I fully believe that udays is being honest but it might have been better to have lied a little because this is the classic excuse Kind of like if you have a habit of walking into doors and falling down stairs you might want to start claiming it was consensual kink so people arent as suspicious I would like to thank you for being honest and concise with your reasons for leaving Previous resignations have left the community with a bad taste in their mouths and the snide remarks whispered back through the door as it closed were very unwelcome I wish you well on your journeys and ventures and I hope you remember reddit as what it was or what it can be after a lot of work but never what it is right now Adieu adieu To you and you and you udays is married to recently let go Reddit employee ukickme When she says shes leaving to spend time with my family it sounds like a tongueincheek you fired my husband so I certainly wont be seeing him at work Also this is awkward Bye All of you thanking her for revealing her reasons to quell your speculations just need to stop speculating in the first place  Since a few women have left reddit recently certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause Well NOW all I can think of is this is the cause Second httpimgurcomgalleryOffEJTR What makes me ask is   so very little will change after my departure Which NOW since you already identified gender as a parameter in this  if I had anyone in mind there was only one person I thought of ukrispykrackers Her amazing knowledge I wonder if reddit just has binders full of women to employ Is reddit selecting employees based on gender I think at this point its a fair question but knowing reddit Ill get the pitchforks for asking I need to spend more time with my family httpiimgurcomyvgJakjpg Ah yes the ol time with family reason In corporate speak that means youre fired but you get to make it look like it is your decision Usually that involves finding a dream job within a few weeks or spending time with your family Sorry theyre doing this to you udays so is krispy still the mod liaison or will that task go to someone else as she moves up Best of luck with future endeavors udays  deleted But youre supposed to say you were run out of the company because youre a woman What is Gawker going to have to write about now Who the fuck is this Thank you for all youve done and good luck in the future Good luck What did uspez do to you You can tell us At the expense of boring you with the truth I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family This is the excuse used by everyone who gets fired Thanks for all that youve done for redditgiftexchange Its definitely one of the more positive things to come from the reddit community and with this media shitstorm its important to emphasize that Good for you for knowing your priorities Your post gotten beaten out by a kid flashing a peacock Im sure Gawker Media et al is going to dismiss this statement as reddit forcing you to make it and it still being a place where all women are hated Theyve never let facts get in the way of a hot take before Seriously though good luck with everything and thank you for clearing things up Later Aligator Who are you What does the Head of Community do Its weird how everyone in reddit positions suddenly realize that they wanna spend time with Family No one has anything at all against reddit Yet they all seem to figure out The Family thing when its blowing around The Company they love Smells og dishonesty all these leavings Writing on mobile so capital letters do wtf they want I mean shes probably telling the almost truth here but cmon almost every high profile person who is forced to resign without admitting they were forced to resign says that they are resigning so that they can spend more time with their family Yeah but who are you Why are we supposed to know who this is So after working for a company for years you decide to leave just as they are restructuring to start becoming incredibly profitable To spend time with family Bullshit I imagine some people belive this but it such transparent nonsensical drivel I cant help but laugh Reddit is going to destroy itself and become another mediocre corporate news outlet I hate that you felt the need to have to explain your departure due to baseless assumptions but its nice to see someone depart on good terms I wish you the best good luck Happy landings I recently took my first consecutive week break from work since I joined the workforce in  and it was pretty incredible I know youll enjoy your family time find plenty to keep you occupied and productive  Or unproductive if you spend your free time surfing the front page So lets not say goodbye but au revoir Good luck Thank you for the transparency and the overt concern for the impact you might make This was pleasant to read even though the news might sound to the contrary So long person that I didnt know existed until I saw this in announcements Thanks for everything It seems like everyone will eventually be replaced by ukrispykrackers at Reddit HQ I plan to leave reddit as well I just dont have anything better to do with my time at the moment Congrats for breaking free ukrispykrackers is a piece of shit Hope you have a nice Christmas and other holidays with your family I also am a long time redditor I used to mod rtwoxchromosomes I met my SO through reddit just a few weeks till our  year anniversary Ive got a white hat trophy Im a charter member for reddit gold etc Not saying this out of pride because thats hardly something to be proud of but to establish that I too am a woman who has been around here for a while and is familiar with the community And overall I think ukrispykrackers is a great choice She obviously cares about the reddit community looks like the was involved in taking out rjailbait and got involved in that neat reddit calendar But this post from two years agohttpswwwredditcomrSRSsuckscommentsfkrthowtheadminukrispykrackershandlescriticism gives me pause Can you guys address that GNU Terry Pratchett Its great to hear that one excellent community manager is replaced by someone who knows reddit intimately and can be an important voice reminding upper management of what things are like on the ground and what reddits user culture is like With the large staff turnover reddit has seen recently its important that continuity of reddit is retained Moving experienced voices up the ladder so theyre listened to more is a good sign for the future Have a wonderful Holiday Thank you and farewell But  but  WE ARE your family  I wish you well in the future youll be missed but not forgotten Im sure  Thanks for the help dealing with spammers bad guys and vote manipulators for me I think the fact that the media portrayed you leaving due to something gender related is sexist in itself because it implies that only genderrelated issues would warrant a female to leave her work Resign to spend time with family is what a Congress person says the week before the indictments Why are so many Reddit Admins leaving Who fucking cares Anyone else sick of these PR attempts by the employees of this disingenuous fuckpile Reddit is not on its way to becoming the best its ever become its been on a cataclysmic decline since about  deleted Good luck Best of luck Oh the times they are a changin huh Thanks for your contributions to reddit Go enjoy yourself All the best I got all this popcorn for nothing Anyone want some should I know who this person is Good luck and have fun at Christmas with your family Auf Wiedersehen Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Yeah thats gonna be a no from me dawg In rredesign there has been a lot of displeasure with how hard it is to tell promoted content and actual content apart There was even a responsehttpswwwredditcomrredesigncommentseiunderstandredditmakesmoneyoffofdvepocontext from the Reddit team saying this was a known issue and they were working on making it easier to distinguish With the dark theme it is now even harder to tell the two apart In the light theme the word Promoted is the only blue text on the page so I guess you can kinda spot it and skim past but in Night Mode Promoted is white the same color as the subreddit name This makes it impossible to tell the difference between an ad and a post unless I read the subreddit name first which no one does Now any idiot can see this is all intentional but its pretty shitty for the developers to mislead the users saying that the bad UI is in the process of being fixed when in reality they are rolling out features that move it further in the other direction I am someone who used to whitelist redditcomhttpsredditcom in my adblocker you can bet I wont be doing that any more Or maybe someday Ill just stop going to Reddit all together if they care about their users so little Reddit really seems to be Digging its own grave these days In the guide to turn it on you never actually said where it is to turn it on Its under profile FYI Also When can I expect purple mode Introducing Night Mode  Check the box to use the redesign as your default experience  Reads title Finally something done right   Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Never mind Ive been bamboozled you can visit httpnewredditcom to try out Night Mode If you enjoy it you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode Yeah nope  Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough Yeah not really when you use actual proper HTML classes for your common colors instead of every element being a detached autogenerated mess like in the redesign its actually pretty easy to incorporate a new theme I mean Ive had night mode with RES for literally ever but thats cool I suppose Please add an option to disable and remove the reddit chat feature as well If Reddit admins actually bothered to read the comments on this thread theyd immediately abandon the car crash new Reddit design Its a shame that because theyve put so much work into it theyre way too stubborn to see that its a steaming pile of dog shit that is neither wanted nor needed LISTEN TO YOUR USERS EDIT Typo Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Lol thats going to be a no Does it come in nonshitty old reddit  To start browsing Reddit in darkness click on your username in the upper right hand corner and then toggle it on If youre on old Reddit you can visit httpnewredditcom to try out Night Mode If you enjoy it you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode Figures youd hold Night Mode hostage on condition of using the horrible redesigned version of the site which is so incredibly wasteful of screen space Right now I can look at rannouncements and see  posts at once Open it in a private window to see the new design and that goes down to    if I dont scroll down past the banner Its also very laggy when scrolling very slow to load this thread took almost  seconds on my mbit connection and some idiot decided that clicking on a post from the sub to look at the comments should have it open in a popover of the sub slowing everything down even further There are probably many many more problems that Id spot if I could bring myself to use the damned thing for more than  minutes of testing edit Oh gods I just noticed that both the subs and posts are infinite loading rather than paged That explains why its so laggy Why do web designers think infinite loading is preferable It just slows everything down  GJ guys you created night mode for the shitty redesign nobody wants The rest of us will continuing using RES and warning you that the redesign looks like complete shit No thanks Ill stick to using the old Reddit and using RES Thats the ultimate Reddit experience You guys should have just taken their work and implemented it instead of going for the ad driven Facebook style garbage youre spewing out now Oh my God I just checked out the redesign for the first time and it is God awful Im sorry I know a lot of you put a lot of effort into this but its bad and you seem to be either oblivious or ambivalent to the opinions of the more vocal portion of your user base The front page has  literally   dead space WTF  less than three visible links aka content like  links  two log in  sign up areas one in the left sidebar and one at the top why do you need   A single add taking up  of the space youre actually using for content  Default sub is now rpopular Why Maybe theres a good rationale here and Im just ignorant  Continuing theme here but just so much wasted space Its ridiculous The compact theme fixes that for the most part but is completely unreadable Literally no color variation  more on the compact view  Why do I need lines between each link Just clutter  Why are the updown arrows so far from one another  Why take away the sub list at the top I use that thing maybe you have data showing most people dont I could accept that  Infinite scroll is slow Prefetch mutch  On infinite scroll not a fan for a site like this Now I have a page with like  items on it  Hidingshowing the side bar is janky The list items stutter Im sure I could find more to complain about but I have to get back to life My wifes reaction was I thought that was Facebook Please stop trying to be Facebook Will the redesign be the only side of reddit to get any updates in the future Or will nightmode eventually be brought on the oldcoughbettercough design How about saving a ton of manhours as well as your website and simply ending development of the terrible new design Your members dont want it Theyre going to block everything you try to shove down their throats as soon as theyre able to And the second you make that new design mandatory your company dies as everyone abandons the site Someone will make a new similar website and everyone will move there while you wonder what went wrong Stop that before it happens No one wants the redesign Just stop it How about you implement it on old reddit I guess i will stay with the reddit i like and RES Soo Night mode only works with the new crappy design  Ill stay with the old design and a browser extension for night mode No offense intended but youre disconnected from your audience A lot of people a want night mode and b DONT want the new design But feedback like this gets lost in any service that gets too big to care Does it auto change with the time as seen on mobile Whats the ballpark date for when you guys plan on killing old reddit deleted Can you guys please stop the redesign and not ruin reddit Your night mode cant hide the poor design choices of the new reddit layout The intent is to provide users with a sense of pride and accomplishment for using our new format As for old Reddit that isnt coming back and we arent updating it Tldr They still like the redesign and wont listen to us  Continuously trying to improve Reddit for yall  Actually implementing this horrible unnecessary redesign Choose one As great as night mode is GDPR comes into effect in less than  hours and reddit still hasnt updated their privacy policy or terms to account for it Most other major sites did this weeks or months ago whats happening with reddits When I saw an rannouncements post I was sure thats what it would be about not a theme for the redesign It looks like post templates are being ignored when Night Mode is enabled Got stuck at step  I aint checkin that box use the redesign as my default experience nice try   Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience No Way to catch up to RES which has offered a night mode for as long as I can remember And they dont even force me to use a shitty new design for it New layout sucks and you should feel bad How does this affect subreddit styling on the Redesign Is there a separate theme for Night mode Gonna give that redesign shit a hard pass You can use browser addons to give old reddit night mode Theres always a bad thing behind reddits announcements Read well  If youre on old Reddit you can visit httpnewredditcom You had me until this part Already tried it and its just not for me I have trouble finding what I want to read and when I do find something its like the posts and comments dont really flow in a way that is enjoyable to read Also  best is completely fubared now Can we revisit that please I cant believe I am actually getting bored on reddit Tbf everything you guys have rolled out the last  or  years has been a complete failure so I dont understand why you keep adding useless shit The entire design team should be fired Scrap the redesign and uspez and start over Thanks deleted Excellent Though its not really a great option until you guys fix things so that night mode doesnt just ignore all subreddit customizations We should at least be able to set the same customization options as on day mode for the night mode it could be something like an alternate stylesheet thats only applied when the user is using night mode The day they fully go through with this trash redesign and remove old Reddit is the day Ill start looking at other similar websites to migrate to But the redesign sucks though  Why nothing for old Reddit after all these years reddit is going to die because of these new changes ive been a member for  years and the site is never been as bad removing controversial subreddits new design new algorithm bigger ads and the best page I just wish this new layout didnt frequently log me out and then not let me log back in so I have to use oldredditcom Add me to the pile of people who would like to use Night Mode but will not do so because of the requirement to use the new design Not for all the tea in China will I use that abomination httpoldredditcom For the last time reddithttpsimgflipcomiaxmaj Id love to use night mode but not in your new dog shit viewing mode Seriously its crap Nice Now if you could just add keyboard shortcuts that would be super Finally But can you deal with the new chat group message that pops up every time I open a new tab Ok Nightmode finally made the redesign readable All the lines made the text just blur together in my mind and I could not seem to focus on one link text vs the next making the whole experience extremely unpleasant New Reddit sucks Lmao theyve been saving night mode to honeydick people into using the redesign nice deleted Have to use a garbage layout that looks like a trashy meme site feed No thanks Man this is like back in the day when everyone used AIM and we all had Power Tools to give it the features we actually wanted like logging and tabs Took them like  years to start implementing those features and then they got replaced by google Anyway RES has had this ability for  years and so has pretty much every rd party app Not really sure how it takes a Design and Engineering team to change the default CSS background color from white to black and the font from black to white This announcement should go well New Reddit sucks  we are continuously trying to improve Reddit for yall Well Stop it  Redesign Well at least you helped out those who cant figure out how to disable it yet Wait how did I get nightmode again then its been here for years I like a darker view but I am an old man fearful of change and will not can not if Im being honest switch to the new design How about you dont fix what isnt broken in the first place Nobody wants this godawful redesign  Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Major OOF Yaay Is there going to be a way to turn off the modal view I want to be able to click on a reddit thread and have it actually take me to the thread instead of showing a popup version of it Or at least a way to turn off infinite scroll Insert comment about the Redesign sucking Cant help but link this posthttpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsljesadminsgettingfeedbackonthenewredditredesign the admins removed yesterday In all seriousness though its a nice feature and I appreciate it Wow thats really cool looking Can your next step be to remove the redesign completely Thanks Reddit I love reddit I really do But please stop trying to force the new reddit on us and actually listen to us when we say WE HATE IT Night mode is not going to make us flock to new reddit like pigeons to crumbs Actually hear us out NEW REDDIT STINKS  We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit httpsiimgurcomjZVOXIgifv Quit trying to make the redesign happen no one wants it to happen How are you going to handle Post Flair customizations with night mode Currently it looks like night mode completely overrides the customizations Seems really bad if they will only be visible on day mode Can you guys just drop the redesign idea and hire the person who made res or buy it off them and just implement it sitewide Like night mode has been a thing with it for years now among plenty of other very welcome changes that make reddit very enjoyable to use oh so youre willing to make an announcement thread about this redesign  Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Fuck no edit Why are you literally doing what drove me from digg in  Why why why Mobile already had this take that PC reddit This has been on Reddit Enhancement Suite for what years now hey guys I know were taking a massive shit on this thing you like but we also sprinkled those sprinkles you ordered  years ago on top of that massive turd We do it for the community youre welcome  Yeah Ill just stick to RESs dark mode thank you very much It doesnt force me to use an ugly redesign Use the redesign as your default experiencehttpsyoutubejaOBzTJBycts Really great to have this I have almost everything I can dark Much better for my eyes and battery THE SACRED TEXTS CAN NOW BE READ WITH EASE Thanks now when i wake up at  am to check reddit i dont have to turn my brightness to zero and still be blinded Yeah New Reddit isnt gonna fly for me This shits too much like a facebook feed I will stick to RES with night mode and adblocking your promoted bullshit I love how the default sort is by QA so they can answer the questions they like and therefore bury the criticism that is being upvoted Just to add my voice to the pile stop forcing the redesign on us The day the classic layout gets removed is the day reddit dies Fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to posting on rthedonald Just to jump on the Redesign is crap train going on here Im going to repost my question that got removed from rredesign tbf they removed it for not having any actionable feedback but the action I want is the redesign removed Is Reddit only good because of the users and subreddit idea Serious question I dont use the official Reddit app since it looks terrible and the redesign looks awful too Their search feature is by their own admission substandard Nothing that has officially been their doing is good The exception is the creation of subreddits the ability of users to create and moderate their own sub forums Reddit has kind of ruined that by the recent redesign and screwing with the layout and CSS rProCSS plug but its still an easy way to make a place for a community This isnt a change is bad I dont like new layouts kind of thing Im upset that the communities I go to are hampered by this redesign and dont have the tools to do all the cool things they could before And I dont like the new layout haha But seriously why the downgrades New users dont want another Facebook They want something other than Facebook for social media so why are we getting the Facebooklite look What group of people are happy with the redesign changes as a whole The redesign is trash even with night mode I made a GIFhttpsireddityxeqnabuzgif for the occasion I hope it works well for whoever uses it but the redesign is gonna have to be a big old hell no for me looks weird feels artificial and looks too much like social media Like I know reddit when a user first joins is an eyesore but god damn we now look like new age website weirdness I also made a reaction memehttpsiimgurcomLEhJYpng Please stop pushing the redesign on us most people like reddit the way it is Why would you put this in QA mode Did no one realize that redditors arent going to like the new redesign Its like the site was run better when it was going down every week back in  Take a hint guys Nobody is ever going to use this feature until the redesign stops being crap At the absolute least make it compatible with CSS so that subreddit owners who actually know what theyre doing can fix your stuff for you deleted  If youre on old Reddit you can visit httpnewredditcom to try out Night Mode Ill pass  If youre on old Reddit you can visit httpnewredditcom to try out Night Mode You almost had me there Not today admins Ill die on my oldreddit hill yes indeed A surprise to be sure For people who dont want permanent eye damage Oh my god night mode is amazing Thank you newredditcom looks absolutely horrible I cannot use Reddit if thats what were going to be forced to use in the future Who thought that design was worth releasing Introduce old Reddit being the default and new Reddit being an option that can be toggled if for some reason you cant handle the internet not all looking exactly the same no matter where you go regardless of how much it makes sense for the site to be that way I just want to say I appreciate the features in new reddit It definitely needs to be able to support CSS but I dont like everyone hating on it just cause its new Dont commit the sunken cost fallacy Just because youve put a lot into it didnt mean you need to stick to it no matter what Recognise the failure of the redesign and move on wait you guys didnt already have night mode Ive been on night mode so long I forgot Reddit was white just download boost or Reddit is fun or some shit Why does everybody in here hate the update The old version was awful and so hard to read The newer version is so much simpler and looks a lot cleaner The only thing I miss was CSS Theres a lot of negativity and complaints about the new reddit It may not be for everyone but I personally dont mind it and appreciate night mode being a builtin feature Thanks So  a new and exciting way to do something that Windows and Reddit Enhancement Suite already do My third party reddit app reddit is fun has had this for years Its about time you stepped up although forcing it through the redesign is almost rassholedesign  Redesign is shit and I wont be using it Meh Ill stick with the old reddit design addon and RES for night mode After what you guys have done with the design of this site I dont really have any reason to switch from something that already works to whatever mess you mightve come up with How about fixing the other features you already added first Vreddit is one of the worst things that has ever happened to this site If yall kept night mode but got rid of New Reddit youd be STRAIGHT BALLIN PS If you end up forcing us to use New Reddit I will quit Reddit and go back to the Something Awful forums Please bring back the old design as a toggleable option How about you bring back the banned subreddits disable the crappy chat and SIGN IN NOW pop ups and ditch the auto playing tile view you see the trouble is the redesign still sucks mate  Check the box for use the redesign as my default experience Uhm Fuck no New Reddit Lol no Listen to your users Reddit We overwhelmingly dont want another Facebook If I want to use Facebook I will I dont and if Reddit goes full Facebook Im gone Why did it take like  years to do something that a browser plugin designed by an undergrad could do If youd like to submit your Custom Feed to be considered in the contest reply to this comment with the category and a link to the feed Make sure it is public Double check one more time Ex Wholesome

you like and follow them too The renaming to custom feeds works I set up a few when I saw it in the app and then realised that it was basically just multireddits something Ive known about for a while but never used Can I create and submit my custom feed of weird subreddits If anyone wants a handcrafted Feed drop a REQUEST in rINeedAFeed and I will build you the most beautiful feed youve ever seen Has the capacity changed to include more than  Been asking for this for years I thought I had a custom feed by subscribing to subs I like maybe Ive been doing things wrong this whole time Have you guys considered letting us save posts into categories It would be lovely to be able to separate for gifs from finance posts from cool space posts from pretty pictures etc With the way it is now its fairly useless cause it takes so long to scroll to the stuff I want to find Why do these announcements always happen when Im in history class and not doing work Listen Im not telling you how to do you job but Ive already won the Discussion category so you may as well just give it to me now Allow me to present you with Talesfromhttpswwwredditcomuseressidusmtalesfrom a very nearly comprehensive grouping of all the Tales subreddits into one beautiful package discussing the horror stories of interacting with other people Missing one of the largest categories there is on Reddit Porn The lack of a memes category is inexcusable Any chance we can filter out subs from rpopular soon please please Can you stop auto switching me to your new layout I dont like the new laylout thats why I stay on old reddit At this point I dont believe it just a bug Just tell me what i have to do to make you stop I spent like  minutes trying to understanding how to use this feature only to reread and notice its not supported on android Wont be getting bragging rights tonight That sounded worse than I intended When will you stop spamming every single mobile reddit page with the OPEN REDDIT APP X button Its fucking pathetic how you are trying to force me to use your shitty app instead of letting me use my browser which has a much needed and perfectly usable translation function This site is turning into bloatware day by day Multireddits are great because some times my smaller subreddit posts get missed by bigger subs in my feed I also noticed there isnt an award for environment History education or volunteerdonation type feeds Pretty disappointing Im a simple man all I need is the ability to mute subreddits from rall Will I still be able to use the multireddits that I have on the app who else just found out this is a feature Well be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has Can we see that information about our own feed Please tell me this will work on old Reddit This is great Sometimes I want to be subscribed to multiple communities but it just makes my feed an absolute mess now I can separate it out into several categories for less clutter When are we going to be able to filter out subreddits on popular for mobile Finally I can put some effort into my porn multireddit Velocifapter Thank you for this I guess its obvious Reddit Inc is trying to marginalize us techies this list reads like the choose your interests section of every corporate marketer Not a single category for technology whatsoevernone of those would be appropriate for a tech or dev sub I mean its not like proggit was one of the very first subs or anything A lot of semirelated subreddits communities currently share a percentage of the same posts often because redditors post the same post to multiple subreddits communities for increased coverage This means that I see a lot of duplicate posts in my reddit feed I know its a complicated problem but it would be awesome if yall could do some kind of deduplication filtering so that when someone spams their latest youtube video I dont see it  times because Im subbed a member of  of the subreddits communities that they posted to Or make these new feeds a first class concept so that redditors can post to a feed But given the readonly connotations of the word feed I suspect this is not in the works Can we mobile users please be able to allow nsfw content from the app I thought Multireddits were for porn Hey you know what would be cooler Retooling your admins so that they dont literally support slave owners I presume you are aware that most of us will use custom feeds for porn right introducing old feature by renaming it ok Ahh time to pimp my reddit  you need rPigifs in your animal subbies feedie  This is a great addition But what about the ability to block subreddits from our feeds Great Can we get a default sort by new setting please Can you please fix the infinite loading bug Im using the app Are the new Custom Feeds features available in the API for third party developers to use as well rCustomFeeds anyone Why do these always have to be introduced to iOS first Why cant I post on the Old Reddit mode on mobile Does this mean youre going to stop promoting political subreddits and topics to me from pages I dont follow even though I follow zero political pages This should be good for your data harvesting and monetization ambitions Bring on even more intrusive hyper targeted ads Please dont force us onto the new design I really dont like it triple backtick support on old reddit plz  Will there ever be a feature like needing captchas or something to make you post different and the ability to only seen content that had a captcha entered so we see less bots and reposts Echo  echo echo No gaming category Almost anything gaming relatedcentered fits in none of these Quirky So let me get this straight I can only create a custom feed if I am using iOS because fck Android Seriously Man this is going to enhance my jerking off potential thanks uSingShredCode yyttsz Yyx te t fttyxtztfzyztfzyryydyxtttzeuuytuyhgzdtzzyzzeuueduxdDdxutzeycxyrxretTTZZZDTYZERRCUDTZTEZeyrfttdtWuEXXXREWDT Im so disappointed at this season of Game of Thrones Ah fuck We social media now deleted deleted Yes So yall doing anything about all the nazis Maybe you might want to try fixing all the bugs you introduced with the last update Whats the point of custom feeds when nothing loads without  tries and  hours oh shit I made it into the screen capture Ah the old Reddit announceroohttpswwwredditcomrHumansBeingBroscommentsbpewwewereallyoungonceensyiutmsourceshareutmmediumwebx This is a lot simpler for newer redditors to use and I had no clue this was a real thing if Im honest Put some effort into getting rid of Russian bot comments they are warping this entire site Will that update happen today for people on mobile I find Custom feeds look pretty neat and Id like to make  real soon on my phone while my couch potatoe roomate is on the computer While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us uspez Will the iOS app now remember the sort order of custom feeds I want to build a custom feed of custom feeds then take over the world Are they going to add Custom FeedsMultireddits to the mobile website At some point will we be able to add more than  to these Blocking only  subreddits from all isnt enough Now I dont need a separate account for nsfw content  deleted That actually sounds nice especially the IOS improvement part imho the new name is more confusing than the old name way more Where is my multireddit on the app Whats the point of the Custom Feeds tab having an icon that takes up  of the screen and that cant be changed The fact that you dont have a nsfw category even though thats what most multireddits arewack First time i hear about custom feeds cracks fingers this is about to get real I know its kinda stodgy but there should be a Learning category Why are we friends on reddit I dont remember adding you can we have pictures in comments Pretty please wowthis is lovely Most Subs Banned per Minute Contest when Dangit When I saw custom Feeds I thought this was rfountainpens and got REALLY excited Still excited but not as much Very welcome changes thank you Hey How do I delete a custom feed I can only find the option to create a new one Hi animal lovers If you have a custom feed and havent added rPuppySmiles to it please do so now This is exactly what I want Maybe now I can actually see post from communities Ive recently joined instead of living in a giant bubble of raskreddit and rbeamazed  I dont have much to say but your name is kinda red and thats cool I guess Please allow us to add quarantined subs to our multis That is amazing What about a easier way to block users Are these all multireddits Can I remove themhttpsimgurcomgalleryPYobo no NSFW feed Of course rblep is in the screenshot but not rblop Also who has enough money to give gold or platinum to a rannouncements post How does this address Reddits censorship issue Social control Love IT Dont forget to check your credit scores purchase ETFs for the long term WTF play your videos games and eat junk food EVERY DAY hippity hoppity bring back rWatchPeopleDie Hey guys why do like fascists so much What percentage of you think youll be on top when this shit really gets bad and is that pushing you all that way Where can we complain about viewpoints that dont align with the group Cool Can you fix the app It hasnt been working properly for like  months A little off topic but does calling for violence in order to end slavery break reddit rules When are you going to ban thedonald you bunch of coward fascist appologist Thumbs up if you on the toilet rn We dont want contests just let us use the old theme without stupid prompts Wait quirky is an option Gimme a sec to comb my hair the other way Im not like other girls Im quirky I like Billy Eilish and I get embarrassed when I talk to boys I have a Tumblr blog and sometimes wear long sleeves that stick of the sleeves of my sweater Boys always ignore me cause Im so quirky why cant they appreciate my personality It cant possibly be that I constantly talk about how men are pigs no That cant be it Its so hard being quirky Will we ever be able to blockban subreddits from our view Thank you redditjust thank you When are you banning rChapoTrapHouse Still cant believe the Seahawks didnt run the ball NO Huge update I dont know where else to ask this so remove if needed Would it be possible to sort through subreddits and comments via most awarded reddit coins Question for the designers what was the decision behind going for a vertical feed instead of a horizontal one Could we have a way to follow a sub but only highly rated posts Sounds very niche but asking cant hurt The reason I want this is that theres a lot of subs with a lot of trash content but where the good content really shines Neat Is there a convenient way to save them or merge them with my normal feed Sometimes I want duplicate posts across different subs to be hidden Does this allow it dangthis confuses me even more Oh thank goodness Ive been griping for ages that Multireddits wasnt in the app Theyre my preferred way of browsing but simply werent accessible on mobile xx You know how you can search for a within a single subreddit You should be able to do that within your saved and liked posts too I think Id be a nice feature On the select subs to add page we should be able to see our subs just like we see our recents Also maybe be able to select from our main subs page and then create a new custom feed from that With the selection we could also mass unsubscribe or something too Uhhhh how do you make one Do memes count as a category Can we have a search history for specific Reddits Like I dont want to search to find a specific topic I saved but if I go under a specific reddit I dont have to search endless feeds If I add a community to a custom feed then unfollow the community so I dont see them in two places will that communitys follower count go down What I guess Im asking is does a communitys follower count include people following custom feeds with that community in it I hereby declare myself King of Reddit and request a unique trophy be made for myself Thank you loyal subjects The rewards look like they are Infinity Stones hahaha So how do you create these custom feeds So with the URL change will old urls still work as expected The only thing that disappointed was the fact that you dont use reddit dark mode  Am i late Once again the mystery  crime community is snubbed Why theres no memes category in the contest rCatsWhoChirp  how do I change the cover picture for the custom feed on ios Oh and please make ist possible to edit the title after creating it This is the stupidest bullshit ever I see the section to create custom feeds but where can I browse existing custom feeds to subscribe to Is there a section for public custom feeds Whats the red name mean Dev When you copy a feed from someone else will you be able to rename the title that appears in the upper left of old reddit I have not figured out a way to edit that Damm bring it on  Web Developerhttpswwwoutsourcingallcomwebdesignanddevelopmenttrainingindhaka Drive is a blog founded in  by developers for the developers The ultimate goal of a group of enthusiasts who formed the blog was to deliver highvalue content which will help make a new generation of web developers and make the web a better place The articles are divided into more than  categories including CSS HTML HTML MySQL WordPress Web design PHP Web development XML and many more and you can get frequent updates a few times a week Could you make it so we can add subreddits were already subscribed to instead of recently visited good Lord in heaven this website is dead Will there be a way to view two or more feeds side by side I always wanted a serious and a nonserious feed on rall for example How about making a subreddit thats in your multi count as a subscription On many of my subreddits I cant eg downvote because it says Im not subscribed But its because I want my reddit in categories and not have to see posts twice Custom feed is cool just tried to use it on my iPhone and it is there but there doesnt seem to be a way to add communities from my list of ones Im already subbed to My only complaint Is there going to be a way on Reddit mobile to block certain subs from my poplarall feed entirely I dont want to see politics or news in my feed and it would be cool to blacklist stuff so I dont see it Sorry if already asked can I set a custom feed to be the default feed I see when I log in Any plans on adding best sorting to these I kinda hate hot sorting because I get a situation where I have a feed of  subreddits and  of the posts are from raww alone No offense to those cute pictures but I want some variety Edit confused hot and top I just want the ability to block subreddits on mobile how do you see the custom feeds on phone maaan i just the bug patched where i randomly get logged out or out of night made Im not saying i dont like these changes I havent even read them tbh Heres a quick videohttpswwwredditcomuserAmgcommentsxizbvhowtostyleasubreddit on how to style a subreddit using the new styling tools deleted  When cruising through posts and comments redditors are only their usernames and the content theyve posted Yes thats exactly who Redditors are Thats kinda the whole point Why do we keep trying to turn Reddit into Yet Another Generic Social Networking Website That Nobody Wants   Custom CSS is complicated Bit of an understatement  I think one of the greatest things about Reddit is that its not about individual users Only the content counts Not the names of the users This is a great thing that sets it apart from social networks It makes possible the focus on the content presented This was an integral part of old Internet where there was simply not enough bandwidth for many images or fancy avatarpictures or other information about users I fear Reddit is losing more and more of this with the advancing of more and more userprofilefeatures I can only imagine the wonderful emojis well see in places like rdankmemes ratbge and rhh This is a slight tangent but I wanted to ask anyway since I dont want to forget to later and its very important to me Will there be a client side option to turn off subreddit themescolorsstyles on a persu reddit basis like you can do right now with Gold or RES Some people such as myself have a lot of trouble reading certain color combinations of text and background colors Currently I disable the CSS of a few subreddits which use dark themes because for my vision those appear to blur the text A good portion of people have this issue as well as many people who have the opposite issue or just other issues with vision So a way to turn off subreddit custom colors while possibly maintaining functional things like dropdown menus would be really great And well dont get me started on places I expect to go wild with at least crazy colors or whatever they can get away with cough ooer cough Basically a way to let users have their own theme or just a default look instead of the colors chosen by a given subreddit even if its restricted to gold as it is now On another note though yay for removal reasons I hope we will see that also come to mobile as thats the main reason I moderate pretty much only when Im at the computer When I joined the redesign I agreed to the trusted tester agreement that is linked in the sidebar of the subreddit and promised not to post screenshots or talk about the redesign outside that subreddit People who have joined more recently have stated that they did not have to agree to those conditions Am I still under them Can we talk about details of the redesign in other subreddits yet What is the thought process behind SO MUCH EMPTY SPACE in the margins of the redesign emojis NOOOOOOOOOO  Now every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign which community members can use in their post and user flair Will these be visible in search and other parts of the site or just while in the subreddit itself Some of the changes seem nice but Im not optimistic Being afraid of complicated things and dumbing stuff down so we get emojis feels very distant from the Reddit I originally started using  But dont worry As we said before we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign This is still in development Can we get some more info on this Enhancements makes it sound like it will be very limited in what we can actually do I like the custom styling features you guys did but for me its not nearly enough As I have said in previous redesignrelated threads it is very inaccessible for people with a vision impairment A lot of controls blend in with the background some parts are cluttered while others are so far apart that they get lost on a magnified screen In the supplied images I have noticed some improvement in terms of colors richer and borders thicker but it still requires mroe effort than it used to to see essential things deleted Weve been promised well be able to enable the option to go to old profile not the crapshow that is the newly designed one Wheres that option Love the bulk mod actions should help a bunch with larger subs What is your stance on subreddit custom CSS that intentionally removes the downvote button Ive come across it on multiple subreddits now  seems counterproductive to have to deactivate subreddit custom CSS to do a native reddit function Hello Reddit Team Over at rstopdrinking weve all of a sudden lost our flairs that count how many days its been since our last drink Users vary with how much this means to them but we often get posts from folks that say something along the lines of the thought of having to reset my flair is what stopped me from drinking Some of our community really are fighting very hard against alcoholism and this is a support that isnt there right now Could this change have something to do with it And if so Would there potentially be a way to roll back the change to get the badge information and then reimplement the modifications Itd be great to see if we could help the mods out  Thank you so much for all your hard work and giving us an amazing platform for so many communities  content Ill ask again since I didnt get an answer last timehttpswwwredditcomrblogcommentsulkheywereheretotalkaboutthatdesktopredesigndtlgy is there going to be a way to disable the lightbox Or at least have it not pop up with middlectrlclick Because opening tabs for later is a big part of my browsing experience and since you guys seem big about the experience lightboxonly will diminish mine Also since I didnt get a response to thishttpswwwredditcomrblogcommentsulkheywereheretotalkaboutthatdesktopredesigndtlocontext either what is the stance of Classic I can probably learn to live with Classic View but I would really rather much prefer to have an optout or even better an optin for the redesign as reddit how it looks now is just fine and I dont see a reason to fix something thats not broken I fully expect this to be ignored but Id love to be proven wrong and get an actual admin response E  Submit Validation is great to finally have It use to fuck me off when my posts were deleted for not having flair because I simply forgot and didnt realise Thanks Can you revert the profile layout Its just awful to look at In general and navigating it is even worse There wasnt anything wrong with the previous version of it Will the existing image flairs still work Subs like rcfb have dual image flairs Will this be supported Will there be an official reddit dark mode A complete redesign and more consistency between the styles of different subreddits seems like a perfect opportunity to introduce a night mode Can yall please make it so that messages from moderator actions taken are separated from personal PMs from other users I mod a big subreddit and it takes years of scrolling just to see a PM from a couple months ago Currently iwe can use  user flairs It was possible at some point in the redesign to use  emojiuser flairs Currently its capped at  in the redesign Any chance this will go back to  or even  Thanks  user flairs is not a lot for subreddits that use flags as user flairs Looks good But the styling seemslacking Color palates and a background Regarding emojis and flairs can these be kept as a separate system For example on ranime and similar subreddits the user flairs are ways of sharing your list of what youve seen via flairs with text in them like MAL MU AniList etc Will this still be possible for subreddits that dont want a shit ton of custom flairs while still allowing stuff like comment faceshttpswwwredditcomranimewikicommentfaces regarding Show All Images aka Card Viewhttpsiredditetpbxbhndgif  the blurry background for pictures seems to be applied very liberally  It looks like its supposed to keep the cards in similar proportions but in a picturefriendly design there shouldnt be as much correction going on Many pictures in there are not even very vertical less so than a typical smartphone screenshot and yet they all have that fuzzy frame Vertical pictures are a rich format and shouldnt be designed against by reddit Theres no need for a third of the screen to be a headline and half to be sidebars The only styling thats needed is making one of the title link or the thumbnail link go to the comments I mean just steal slashdot UI with the big number on the top right of every story I dont like the idea of avatars being present in the comments section as it only detracts attention from discussion and clutters the GUI Why should I care about what an individuals profile picture is when Im just scrolling through a comments section If Im interested Ill click through their profile otherwise I dont want to see it It seems like a move thats very unlike Reddit as this site has never been focused on the individual but on what that individual contributes through discussion and posts What are the plans for mod tools to edit user flairs About what it is now On rSurvivor we have an expansive flair system This includes color flairs available for a limited time each season We change the colors of the flair for each contestant based on how they do in the season We also award badges for people that correctly predict winners before the season These we have added via CSS Are these things that we will need to continue to rely on CSS on or will we have the tools to implement these changes using the new system And will the new CSS be available before the official launch so we can do that Possible to have some note feature so we can input notes to attach to users IMO its a nice to have feature to be aware of whats happening from our moderator perspective that Ive done or other mods have taken action on for that user Ex We banned that person for a few days in the past but just happen to be they are not being a good user again We have that trail then to look back on Yes Emojis Emojis are what will make reddit great again what weve all been clamoring for Finally s I have some concerns about a lot of the styling but overall the functionality changes look really good The searching by flair in particular is long overdue Im interested in the submit verification thing though Is this going to work like a CAPTCHA and hopefully deter bots from running rampant across the site I do wish that Reddit would stop painting CSS as the bad guy It would be more accurate to say Custom CSS can become complicated can break if not done correctly which can ruin the Reddit layout and is not currently rendered on our mobile website Im fine with the redesign work itll make customization easier for many Just state the fact that you choose not to make custom CSS rules available for the mobile version of the site Easy peasy I still stand by my stubbon arrogance that fears these changes greatly Kind of sad that subs like rCFB have to lose their dual flairs and submit to a  flair limit for a redesign that doesnt even look good Can I suggest a sidebar widget A countdown timer DDHHMISS would be very useful subreddits will be gag now Congrats on making the redesign look just as shitty as Facebook  Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they arent confused by the rules when posting in a new community they have the opportunity to fix their errors and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that dont meet these guidelines Does this mean title editing is coming Or is Reddit just going to tell someone sorry please fix your post and the title will still be set in stone once submitted I havent seen the flair filtering function in the redesign alpha yet is this a new feature about to be released such as requiring flair Does this mean that users can add flair when they submit instead of adding afterwards like they have to do now Because that would be absolutely amazing Also could you add a NSFW checkbox or something to the submission form so that users arent required to tweak anything after they submit their post What subreddit have banned the most people i cant wait until every single available partyparrot on rpartyparrot becomes a default emoji thats gonna happen right Care to comment on those giant advertisements in the sidebar thats featured in the gifs you posted above You completely omitted that from your discussion of the sidebar Seems really sneaky If ads are going to appear on the sidebar on every page then it seems to me like the main purpose of this redesign is to maximize ad revenue Thanks for the update The User Info Cards sound interesting I know you said it but for love of all that is holy please dont gimp CSS options for those who would like to use it It sounds a bit like youre going to allow just light version of CSS rather than what people expect Can you please elaborate what will be allowed with CCS on new design How many more features are going to be added as default settings before the redesign goes live Cause theres still a bunch of stuff like custom thumbnails I hate card view honestly larger collapse comment buttons which can be used halfway down a comment thread for when youre done with the thread and want to see the next set of comments How about granted user flairs Some subreddits give flairs to employees and such which set them apart from the regular users Any news on better spoiler tags like what most subs use Spoiler Tags Spoilers go here Can the widgets work in wiki pages For example on rLightNovels we have a calendar with all the newest releases for the month while we cover all year in our wikihttpswwwredditcomrLightNovelswikiupcomingreleases It would be nice to somehow be able to port over the information from the wiki into the calendar on the sidebar easier than how I manually do it now Will multireddits still work I use one religiously for grouping all the smaller subreddits Im subscribed to so I dont miss whats going on there while I visit the bigger subreddits personally On that note will RES shortcuts still work fine This is a major important thing for me  But dont worry As we said before we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign Id like to believe that  This is still in development Youre not making it easy  Going forward well support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign Thank you This sounds like a godsend to avoid CSS kludges deleted I know Im in the minority on this but I tend to almost universally hate the custom styling that subreddits come up with More often than not the custom styling manages to add horrible color combinations unnecessary and confusing layout changes or just flat out breaks the functionality of the site both intentionally and unintentionally Therefore I usually wind up disabling custom CSS persubreddit using RES Unfortunately this does mean that I lose emojis and image flairs so I think its pretty cool that youre implementing that natively The other nonCSS customizations youve added so far dont seem TOO bad but I could see the color customizations being misused in particular and I dont know whether you plan on adding anything else My question is are you going to allow users to disable custom subreddit styling just as you currently allow disabling custom CSS Reddit V is coming soon The text size of the comments and other UI elements is too small Can you align with your current desktop font sizes My personal opinion about this design and the mobile design is that it looks washed out and visually unappealing I cant help but feel that youve got this really wrong This does not look like it is meant to be actually read as in reddit so some notes assuming anyone reads this considering how late I am  Subreddit sidebars disappear if your browser window isnt wide enough As a mod I have a hard enough problem with people not following the rules when they ARE able to see them Also I dont want to have to reexpand or zoom out my window to see the sidebar on the subs I visit The sidebar still exists on the profiles you insist on having why not do the same with the subreddits  Linked comments Upon following a link to a comment like sohttpsalpharedditcomrannouncementscommentsxjtgbecauseitsvalentinesdayheresalongwindeddua the only way to see the full context is to open the full comments and hope the comment was popular enough to find it in the mess Compared to nowhttpsredditcomrannouncementscommentsxjtgbecauseitsvalentinesdayheresalongwindeddua where you can just click View the full context This is just straight up removing a feature and Id like to see it added back  Image posts RES allowed us to expand images once opened your cards do not This is a minor thing but it does bug me  Comment coloration The current design has a clear separation of each comment from each other thanks to the alternating colors and each comment having its own box The redesign does away with that For me at least this makes all the comments kind of flow together awkwardly and makes the threads harder to read I do really like the new expandable sidebar list on the left though Thats a good change You might have already asked this somewhere else But I put a lot of work into the CSS of rrandomactsofcards and its not too complicated to do CSS When the new changes get implemented is it just going to wipe everything to a blank template and then I have to implement everything I want over again within the confines that you have Or will it recognize some of the things Ive done like a calendar in the sidebar and just convert it to the new sidebar calendar that youve linked Cake or pie Are there plans to bring subreddit emojis or hopefully even flair editing to the mobile version Are the emojis in addition to a communities custom flair or does it replace it can we have all these features but keep the old interface Hi I had just one question Will there be a classic layout option in settings or something I like the new layout but I know some will not uxfile is going to be happy Doge is dead I get its kind of Reddits thing though ctrlf and types in app  hits Feels bad man As a Toolboxinspired effort to improve our own mod tools were pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign How many removal reasons are we being capped at  like the official Rules page or more  is already a bit of a handicap when some rules have multiple moving parts to them I was going to make this suggestion in the redesign subreddit but I guess this would be a good opportunity to mention it It would be nice if Reddit made some templates for customization They could help those mods that suck at color theory to make something that doesnt curt the eyes of the users It would be nice to have more options for the background too just like the templates Also I have a question is there a recommended resolution for the background Great news on the flair filtering I also love the post requirements rules so that it is more clear for the users why their submission is not coming through I cannot seems to get the calendar widget working over at raskscience I dont know if I messed something up or what The calendar ID seems ok Do you plan to add a comment nuke like toolbox does Removal reasons contextual ban usernotes and nukes are the features that are the most useful from toolbox imho Oh no please dont add emojis in post flairs Thats the last thing reddit needs more emojis taking up space and distracting you Doing anything about ass hole mods No Ok then time is running short for Reddit Whats wrong with things as they are I like the css and weve worked hard on getting our subs design right It will take ages to redesign everything I feel like youre making more work for us that is unnecessary how about fixing the things that matter instead of shoving a redesign down everyones throat that nobody actually wants its been  years and we still cant search comments and the searching that we can do sucks the antispam algorithms that subreddits are forbidden from opting out of allow majority opinion to censor minority viewpoints by imposing  minute posting delays i know multiple communities have presented this problem to the admins but you guys havent done shit to address it instead you just talk about how css is hard What about communities like roffmychest and rtwoxchromosomes that continue to ban users based on their post history using bots Which is against the rules of reddit When will you ban people who ask for subspeople to be banned because they dont agree with their beliefs Firstly your biggest strength is your UI As a bit of prescience for when this is read in the future I implore you not to change your UI Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community With the new Post Requirements moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by such as requiring flair or title length restrictions Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they arent confused by the rules when posting in a new community they have the opportunity to fix their errors and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that dont meet these guidelines Will this be able to be structured to enforced key words in any way I would suggest it be limited only to length and flair as a way to ensure content based post tageting is not occuring pre emptivly thus making it harder for other moderators to review those removals in the modlog Also will the mod log have an entry every time a user fails to meet submission criteria It would be really useful to ensure this is an individualized note in the mod log to ensure accountability  Fun fact When Reddit first launched usercreated subreddits werent even an option In the years since the very first ones were created our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years And it was better then Reddit broke my heart when you killed rredditcom You teased me again with rprofileposts just to crush my dreams again Are public spaces ever making a return to reddit I still member when you used to whisper sweet nothingshttpsspredditcompropagandahtml  todays headlines  chosen by readers not editors nbsp  We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal Take freedom back into your heart reddit I beg of youhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdenvyVUSc Are you guys doing anything for the user end who have problems with mods No one outside of TheDonald is happy with how rCanada is being run and the mods are active members of troll communities As long as css customizations get to stay Im glad The fact that you guys are planning on bringing native support to customization without scrapping css altogether is a step in the right direction Looks like a lot of great updates for mods one thing Im curious about is whether there are plans to incorporate native usernotes It would be prohibitively complicated to fairly moderate subreddit users on a discussion sub without usernotes they allow us to track rules violations so that were only banning users who demonstrate chronic rules issues The toolbox integration is a lifesaver but its clunky and we find ourselves having to manually delete old usernotes when the system fills up deleted Are subreddit emojis available to third party apps via the API What about filtering posts by flair Please tell me that emojis will not turn into spam Theyre great and all but I love the simplicity of the current systemand I feel like emojis could very quickly ruin that How will they be implemented in a way that prevents this One of the things I have been wanting most is a mod report card for users It often isnt easy to maintain consistency with multiple mods that are active at different times A problematic user might get several last warnings at different times because mods might not see each others actions Being able to leave notes linked to a specific account regarding problematic behavior would be a great help Even something as simple as Warning for spam  would go a long way in helping us be consistent I have less of a problem with cards in subreddits That makes more sense if the sub is primarily image focused I still worry about cards on main though I worry it will push out other content when that other content is what makes Reddit good At least it would if its the default The bigger images will draw the eye while the links will not Thumbnail view albeit with maybe variations on size seems better Plus it avoids any screenshot showing the entire site so clearly that the user never has to click Is there going to be an option to use a basic form of Reddit for people on low bandwidth Like google using HTML version for Gmail A little late to the thread How many subreddits were banned this time simply because some redditors complained Can we have a way to default the our user profile view back to the Legacy one Will we still have the option to prevent subreddits from showing us styles The clean no nonsense interface is a big part of why i come to Reddit so I want to make sure that if I use classic view I can also not see custom styling How about actually doing something that will matter All the suggestions of improvements here and on rblog show you guys are out of touch Censorship is rife on Reddit and alot of it is actually done by automod and other bots Further users are not even notified by default if their contributions are not getting through Only if you log off and try cedditcom can you even find out See Try to get something past invisible automoderator or bot filters httpswwwredditcomrRedditCensorscommentsvplltrytogetsomethingpastinvisibleautomoderator How about  Being transparent about censorship and bot filters Inform users when their posts are not going through and why  Forcing all moderation to be done openly No one pays for subreddit space the least you can make the nerd moderators do to earn that subreddit space is force transparency regarding their actions rconspiracy already does that and a few other subs rModerationLog already did the work to make transparent moderation possible  Allow subreddits to disable up and downvoting All that does is gamify the medium Sure it probably makes people spend more time on Reddit arguing about karma and makes the downvoted feel aggrieved and others victorious but it makes actual discussion suck Allow subs to disable it without CSS hacks than can be bypassed anyway If you think Reddit is a good medium to post in as a user please get uspez to tell Serena Williams to create another Reddit account On that account have her identify as black womanwhich she is but dont disclose she is a famous tennis superstar in the public limelight for over a decade And have her post with an innocuous signature saying she is  year old African American women attached to all of her posts and see what happens to her Reddit is not the frontpage of the internethttpswwwthedailybeastcomredditisnotthefrontpageoftheinternet it is only the frontpage of the internet for mostly young surly white nerds who vidya game Case in point I remember most of my coworkers from the Newark area talking about the death of someone very well known in the black community in Newark Uggiehttpwwwnjcomessexindexssfnewarkstreetperformergunneddowncopsseekingthtml but in rnewark which pretends to represent a majority AfricanAmerican city in the Redditosphere no one knew or posted he died Have Serena post without being Serena but being just another black woman and you will see why African Americans and many other demographics avoid this medium like the plague There isnt anything actually forcing us to use these tools on our communities is there I plan on keeping any communities I run as oldschool as possible I hope this doesnt end up the way diggs redesign did Really appreciate the detailed update The thirdparty tools being integrated into the redesign is quite nice Looking forward to the next update can we set classic profile to default yet The new profile is such an eyesore and is more difficult to actually navigate So were turning Reddit in to Facebook but a highly editable Facebook so Myspace Can you make the mod queue look less terrible Its really hard to tell what is a comment and what isnt deleted All Reddit admins are cucks No one wants the interface changes  Is this preemptive to monetizing your API First remove all user customizations second monetize the API as people flee to mobile drive out mobile competitors and force people back to your suite of products Way to Digg yourself an old hole Jesus Christ Reddit Emojis and user cards Blockingignoring This is the beginning of the end You are creating the same dopamineloop popularity contest and circle jerk that was myspace and is facebook Havent you learned that this ruins what people love about these sites and then eventually ruins the site itself Reddits collective IQ is about to drop  points Reddit is for readers Dont clutter up our pages with all this visual noise When will you ban subs like LateStageCapitalism or AgainstHateSubreddits You banned obscure right wing subs that were doing nothing wrong When will you ban subs that call for genocide against whites or cops Cant wait for this update You guys communicating with the community is the best part These updates seem great but Im just happy to see that rgreenday got mentioned Valentines Day has gone well but seeing that has made it How do you feel about staff of particular companies being mods in the the relevant subreddit Mods in rlootcrate who work for the company have been deleting posts about a dangerous fault with their product melting oven glove and now there has even been a recall issued How is it acceptable to endanger people in this way It seems like a massive conflict of interest Especially since there was drama recently about mods being paid on behalf of companies behind the scenes how is this any different More info httpswwwredditcomrlootcratespoilerscommentsluvpsapossibleinfinitygauntletovenmittsafety Edit Now they admit it was actually company policy to delete the offending posts mind boggling Why posts were removed Our social team was advised to remove posts due to us sending out an official message via our own owned channels to anyone who received the oven mitt with further info The email gave them more information on how to proceed We are currently investigating and taking appropriate action to to resolve httpswwwredditcomrlootcratecommentsmblbofficialinfinitygauntletrecallemailsareduup Ever thought of buying RES and integrating it into the main site so that the vanilla reddit experience is actually worthwhile Do you ever think about unbanning every single user just to see the chaos it would create Okay heres a dark secret question Can Super Mods and Admins see users IP addresses if they have multiple accounts Can you see the main account of a throwaway Edit I dont know what a super mod is either guys I just figured there were Mods then there were MODS Why are power mods still allowed you know the ones they lord over  subs squatting and waiting for them to become relevantand then they promptly treat redditors like garbage Visit rMakingAMurderer sometime one just absolutely destroyed it They all had to flee to another sub rTickTockManitowoc Another example reached the front pagehttpswwwredditcomrAdviceAnimalscommentsmkiitheinmatesaretrulyrunningtheasylum yesterday This is an all too common practice and I dont understand why this type of behavior is allowed Why are we allowing power mods to exist Edit Hey Spez lookhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsmegfwamaaboutmydarkestsecretsduwh one of the very I guys I was talking about turned up Heres your chance to see for yourself and give us some sort of answer on the issue Anything new you can tell us about privacy on reddit Quite a few people were concerned by your recent commentshttpswwwredditcomrvideoscommentslmfmjceoofredditstevehuffmanaboutadvertisingon to which the title of this post alludes We know all of your interests Not only just your interests you are willing to declare publicly on Facebook  we know your dark secrets we know everything and would like further explanation Are your comments representative of the policies of reddit Inc Does this herald the implementation of highly targeted advertising based on subreddit preferences or perhaps something much more sinister like mass data collection which could then be sold on I think if you could clarify these comments it might put people slightly more at ease How do you feel about the default subreddits How often do you ban people while on the toilet When will mredditcom be not horrible and useless and what was the impetus to change it from not horrible and useless to horrible and useless originally Can you tell us why this was removed from reddits core values  Respect anonymity and privacy You are not required to share more than you are comfortable with Having information doesnt give you a license to use it Allow people to be as anonymous as they choose including ourselves Value the candor afforded by anonymity See httpsnpredditcomrvideoscommentslmfmjceoofredditstevehuffmanaboutadvertisingondolvco What is your biggest regret in life Do you think reddit will still be relevant in  years from now Hey uspez Do you mind answering this questionhttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentscljiwheredidmypostaboutsearscomsurlhackableccimcontext now You told us to check back with you in a few months I think  years is sufficient time Here is the History for those that dont remember the glorious Fuck Sears IncidenthttpswwwredditcomrTheBookofRedditcommentshpmihistorythefucksearsfiasco I am still interested in the real story behind this and think it fits perfectly in the darkest secrets thread Also interested in what entities or corporations if any have that kind of power over reddit today and could actually get a post taken down globally deleted Whats the best and worst thing about running Reddit Do you think you guys are making as much progress as you had hoped What areas and ideas are you really happy with and which do you feel still need more work When do you expect more mod tools to become available why do you have all our secrets  what did you mean by that statement Even though you are an Admin what do you enjoy most about Reddit as a User Sorry for the kinda vague question Be honest what does udrunkeneconomist actually do at reddit besides keeping the whores in rcenturyclub in line Whats your reddit password Ill ask the obligatory question fa when Could you talk more in depth about the decision to conspicuously replace links to various vendor sites with reddit affiliated versions to increase site revenue without the user being aware Do you have any thoughts on the man who was banned from over  subreddits in one day httpswwwredditcomuserExileOnMeanStreet httpswwwredditcomrsubredditcancercommentssithisweekiwasbannedfromsubredditsina What was the real reason Victoria was let go Whats the deal with uADEFDBC now deleted Im assuming the admins know the purpose because his subreddit was once banned and is now unbanned What do you guys know about the project and posts and all Hi Steve I think the last one of these I inquired about the onboarding process for new user accounts Has that made its way into the timetable yet Id like to once again emphasize my belief that a thorough introduction to the site its philosophies how it works and the actual nature of subreddits as independent communities will cut out SO many issues faced by both users and moderators An effective presentation to firsttime users could really solve a lot of little issues that we frequently see compound into larger ones Regardless of the answer thanks for taking time to do another of these Theyre always interesting and informative Reaching out to the Admins for stuff has been incredibly hit or miss Ive reported seriously abusive users through rredditcom and never gotten a response and then brought minor matters up and heard back very quickly I also recently detailed by issues with your AMA supporthttpswwwredditcomrModSupportcommentshgxqkdoesanyoneactuallymonitoramadataredditcomor and while publicly complaining did solve my immediate issue ukrispykrackers is gone and that is no guarantee things are actually getting better I know that there was recently a few new hires but could you go into a bit more detail on how the Admin team is working to improve its ability to interact with mods and assist them in what they need There has been a noticeable trend of moderators in very large subs and apparently smaller subs moderated by people with a distinct conflict of interest that is NOT made clear to the casual visitor not really moderating them as much as directing the discussion in a way that suits their personal beliefs Now on most subs this would not be an issue rPokemon should be positives about Pokmon rconservitive and rliberal positive about conservative and liberal values respectively This makes sense as it is the point of the sub The types of subs where this would end up becoming an issue are ones that would appear to the layperson to be an impartial sub for example rnews rworldnews or rpolitics On the surface and in the way they are described these subs should not take a stance one way or the other Edit In addition to the large subs trying to appear impartial subs for products companies people etc especially when a potential conflict of interest is in play or unwrittenambiguous rules are enforced to steer the conversation are also effected Given some of the recent developments regarding Facebook and their curatingcensorshiptweaking of their trending topics do you feel that social media outlets have a duty to provide an impartial service to their patrons Or as in the case with targeted subs at least make it clear that things are only being presented with information from one perspective EDIT I have another example that I noticed because of a good question from uMK that would be directly impacted by better rules regarding transparency and fulfilling the implied duty that a sub and its mods have to redditors The sub rlootcrate is devoted to the popular nerd subscription box of the same name Their rules include your basics no spoilers on box content before a certain date no NSFW how to post spoilers after the blackout date and two more i want to point out no posting or discussing other subscription boxes and Mods have the last say on what is allowed the sub is not Lootcrate customer service they will delete content to promote using the proper customer service channels No posting or discussing other subscription boxes This sort of makes sense and sort of doesnt It is a sub for fans to discuss Lootcrate right A common thing in many subs is to discuss recommendations regarding other products services or advice on things not covered explicitly by that sub even if it is just in the comments and not a dedicated post This makes sense you want advice from people that you know have like interests and experiences right Otherwise it may as well just be the product comment section on the official website right A sub dedicated to rHalo may have suggestions about similar games to play during a delay and rDiablo may have a submission asking for similar games but with offline play Hell roculus decided that the best way to serve their constituent redditors was to flat out open up discussion to ALL forms of VR tech This is how you take what would have just been a circle jerk and turn it into a real community That makes it a bit weird to ban any community discussion on topics other than Lootcrate Mods have the final say on what is and is not allowed Can you imagine if that was how the police determined whether you broke the law or not Get pulled over by a cop for having a sticker for his kids schools rival on your car is illegal on this street on Tuesdays Why He said so and he has the final say They do say that the reason that they are going to delete many posts is to encourage redditors to take their comments to the customer service department as the sub is not the service department Ok this sort of makes sense to remind people that the sub is not official and customer service is often the best route but many subs have realized that the higher level of accountability and visibility of product reps actively participating in the community is a very good thing for nearly all vendors rvaping is a great example of awesome involvement from the companies discussed Not only are redditors warned of potential pitfalls but they also get to see that companys customer service first hand Its win win right Not to rlootcrate Why would someone set up a sub to discuss something then limit the discussion to only positive commentary There is no fulfilling conversation there so why Well it turns out the why is because the top mod is an employee of Lootcrate making it an official corporate sub run by the corporation A fact that you would not know by looking at the sub because it is never mentioned This means that any redditor doing research to see if this service is for them will see that sub and nothing but glowing reviews Since they have a general trust in the reddit system of group verification that must mean this is an awesome box if no one has anything bad to say It is especially awesome that they definitely did not send out a faulty product like oh lets just say an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt that was melting and potentially hurting people That would surely be brought up on the sub right Well I see no posts about it so it must be good to gohttpspbstwimgcommediaCjUMviPXEAAXhTFjpg At least it seems that the sub finally started allowing posts regarding the recall of the product they sent out but they certainly censored initial report on the potential of people being hurt and their product melting These are the self serving mods with rules designed to benefit themselves at the cost of redditors that I think need to be evaluated Also keep in mind that according to current Reddit policy it is totally OK for Lootcrate to moderate the sub devoted to them and set the rules using paid employees as the moderators If however I was the person that was the top mod and set identical rules in regards to posting and conduct in the sub and accepted a free subscription to Lootcrate for doing so I would be permanently banned for accepting a kickback Make this transparent for the sake of the redditors If you are moderating a sub about yourself your product or your company ESPECIALLY if you receive any sort of compensation for it that should be clear for transparency integrity and I did not think it would be this serious safety If your rule is to delete all negative feedback post it clearly in the sidebar Do not hide it behind a catchall mods have the last word clause We are not asking for any huge changes to Reddit We are not even asking mods to enforce new rules or stop enforcing old ones All we request is that they clearly list what their rules are and if they have involvement that could conflict with the best interests of redditors Edit To those who expressed a skeptical outlook on whether this issue would be addressed rest easy An Admin did weigh in regarding the subject in another top comment chain The issue is not being avoided but it is one that will take time discussion and finesse to address in a way that will provide positive change regarding integrity of the site and transparency without overstepping and moving censorship from behind to curtain to being official policy It is also important that if any policy changes are made they do not compromise the things that make Reddit great like leaving nearly all control to the mods who can then tailor their subs to best serve their community in content tone and message are you guys gonna do anything about the new algorithm Breaking news like shootings still take an hour to get to the top of rall also ralltop is pretty much frozen in time because of the new algorithm I want to see it change over time like many others Theres obviously been some controversy about your statements about knowing redditors darkest secretshttpswwwredditcomrvideoscommentslmfmjceoofredditstevehuffmanaboutadvertisingon While I expect a certain amount of tracking andor ads going on on free sites the alarmist response over such a vague statement in somewhat expected I think people including myself would appreciate some transparency on how our information is being used  What information is collected  What is it used for  Who is it made available to  How securely is it stored  To what degree is it scrubbed andor anonymised Can we have a mod removal mutiny button for when a mod is out of control and fighting the rest of the team So far from what I understand you cant remove a mod without them being inactive Ive seen people talking about this issue before Sometimes you think you have the right person for the team and you just really really dont I dont know much about you Whats the one word  sentence that sums you up best As a CSS mod on rStevenUniverse I very much dislike the push towards mredditcom mainly because of the spoiler problem Obviously we dont want to restrict discussion of new episodes of the show but we simultaneously want to keep the experience pure for those who havent watched giving users an option to avoid spoilers while still enjoying the subreddits content Our solution has been to completely ban NSFW content and reskin the tag as a Spoiler tag This has a couple consequences the main ones being  If you have NSFW posts hidden you wont see spoiler posts  If users look at mredditcom this reskinning is disabled  Subreddits that want to do this must completely ban NSFW posts since you cannot tag a post as both NSFW and spoilers and you cant just leave NSFW posts or spoilers unflagged I would love for moderators to have the ability to enable spoiler tagging on subreddits to make the experience more consistent and keep people from PMing us asking why our sub is filled with NSFW tagged posts This is a concern for many TV show subreddits and in fact many subreddits that center on content that can be spoiled like comic books or movies Do you have any word on when these problems may be addressed Do you have any plans to revise the subreddit request function Right now Im trying to get a subreddit that was created after my name rJaguarGator and was created by uRagwort who created the subreddit  months ago and has done absolutely nothing with it It should be noted that Ragwort has created over  subreddits named after other Redditors that he has done nothing with However because hes technically active the request by the bot was denied Any plans to change this so that it requires that a mod be active on that particular subreddit in  days and not just on Reddit Is a hotdog a sandwhich What about a taco Sharks or Penguins Warriors or Cavs Do you like pineapple on your pizza Whats your guys policy on payed actors on reddit Things like Putin bots that Hillary pac that was paying people to correct internet message boards Do they fall under the spam  payed advertising policy Or are they allowed since they arent directly selling things Do you have methods of tracking that kind of activity  What do you think makes reddit different to other social media sites out there  Batman vs  badgers who wins Was Ellen Pao just a bait and switch to take the heat for decisions everyone hates Is it secret Is it safe Do you like pina coladas Heres one rtattoos is moderated by a complete jerk who violates every rule the sub is supposed to hold itself to is rude and hostile to posters and who delivers a permaban at the drop of a hat and with absolutely no recourse Ive been banned for over a year because I had the misfortune of being cursed at by another poster and quoted his statements to me in a subsequent post as an example of how NOT to behave That poster and I made up said nice things about each other and all was well  until the banhammer from the main mod on that sub Who when I inquired about the potential of lifting the ban proceeded to berate me with the same language that I DIDNT EVER USE that got be banned in the first place More than once Ive been in contact with other mods and while they are sympathetic they are apparently so afraid of the guy that they wont cross him or in the one time one tried to defend me buck his absolute rule What gives with that and what do you think you can do about it deleted Please dont repeat digg guys we do not have plans to do away with the current site Arrested Development Narrator But they did deleted Thank you so much for the recent update that now prompts me to download your app every fucking five seconds and lingers on the back page Fuck that shit I use Reddit all day everyday and I dont want your fucking app So are you still working on dark theme I cant browse Reddit at  am anymore  And if you dont like it you can opt out  Furthermore we do not have plans to do away with the current site until voluntary adoption slows down just enough for you to say Well almost no ones using the older version of the site so we might as well shut it down of course Could we have a preference option to default to oldredditcom instead of the redesign Edit this exists under beta options thanks utaulover Ive been using the new style for a bit now and Im still not finding the overall experience is particularly enjoyable for a few key reasons  I mostly come to reddit because Im interested in the discussion and the new reddit hides the number of comments way on the other side of the page from all the other information Since the redesign Ive found myself opening  comment threads constantly As an addendum I dont actually care what the actual numeric score of a submission is its clearly high enough to be on my front page beyond that the number doesnt affect how Ill interact with the story Before it was sort of low key but now this part is doubly emphasized with both very prominent positioning and the extra space taken by the updown arrows  The modal view for single left click is not very comment friendly Now if Im writing a long comment all it takes is a misplaced click and all my work is lost At the very least there should be a warning when trying to close a modal with text in a comment form  I would always browse subreddits with custom CSS turned off because I like the clean and consistent experience With the redesign a bunch of subreddits now have a huge banner that takes a lot of my screen real estate for no particular reason It would be nice to opt into a more minimal UI that tries to conserve screen real estate  Putting the Hide button in the extra menu makes it much less useful Previously if I found myself seeing the same stories too often I could just go down the list and hide the ones Ive seen Now its a long mouse movement and then  clicks to hide something which makes it much less usable  With the emphasis on opening the comment thread from the topic list theres now much more mouse movement involved in opening an actual link Though I do appreciate how its easier to get to comments now it would be nice to have the link itself be in a more consistent position uAmg when will we be seeing updates to the way promoted posts are displayed As both a reader and a moderator it is VERY jarring to read a headline and immediately think this doesnt belong here  this needs to be reported or removed before I notice the tiny Promoted tag below it It creates an immediate negative impression before Ive even had a chance to consider the content of the ad itself It doesnt benefit me as a reader and I seriously doubt Reddits advertisers want that either These posts really need a distinctive border or background color so Im not reading them with my gatekeeping senses turned on Oh God is this an April Fools joke This redesign should wait until theres a nonVoat reddit substitute we can all flee to I dont like how ads looks exactly like a post now They give you the option to upvotedownvote and the thread is locked It just feels scummy Edit heres an examplehttpsimgurcomgallerydHZGv Its here Yeah I was so looking forward to it I switched back to the old design Stuff I like  The new Editor I dont like markup so thats a big plus  The general design Its clearly arranged now Stuff I dont like  Im not able to collapse comment threads anymore which makes navigating huge amounts of comments a pain  The redesign utilizes loading graphics Every site that uses loading graphics has a problem imho  Theres too much Javascript going on the redesign takes some time to load compared to the default design I bet a few things couldve been done with less Javascript and more CSS and HTML  The font is still too small  The thumbnails are still way too tiny As soon as theres less stuff going on in the windowonload function Ill switch back to the redesign I come to Reddit to read information and this update has made that experience significantly worse I dont need cute boxes eating up extra space around every link Useless information is highlighted and given extra space upvote tally while useful information is sidelined replies The column of icons link pic text is pointless I use the hide link to remove things Ive read from my list and now thats buried in a pulldown menu  along with save The new font looks terrible and pixelated Having links on the right in a different color distracts from the actual post title To me these changes make the site layout much worse without making a single improvement to either ease of use or presentation of information  Furthermore we do not have plans to do away with the current site We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit no plans currently but is this subject to change in the future I am personally not a big fan of the redesign and would not look forward to it suddenly becoming the default in the near future I wish the new redesign didnt break flair in the sports subreddits Its a huge part of the culture on rcfb for example I understand itll improve the site as a whole but I feel thats a pretty big casualty Id rather not tbh Theres a bizarre number of positive comments in this thread You guys are seriously tugging at me heartstrings here I have gone from excited that we would have the option to be able to use the site as it currently exists no changes whatsoever as hinted in an announcement posted over a month ago here httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentslmitilreddithasadesignteamdv To somewhat disappointed but had forced myself to come to terms with it  due to this answer posted in another announcement post  days ago httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsnyjashortishhistoryofnewfeaturesonredditdvrvp And now this All that said we know that many of you love Reddit just the way it is If you are one of the lucky few chosen to test out the redesign and prefer the existing Reddit experience you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top or visit oldredditcom Furthermore we do not have plans to do away with the current site We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit we are looking at you iredditcom I dont know how much more me teeny cold heart can take of this But I genuinely hope that this is the final answer and that you guys ultimately decide on keeping oldredditcom around indefinitely That would make me happy Thanks guys for keeping us all updated on the redesign process Pretty rad of you all I dont like the massive click area for posts On mobile I can understand for people with fat fingers but on desktop with a very precise pointer it is next to useless This post describes it well httpswwwredditcomrbetacommentsigfrequestprovideanonclickablecardviewor Why does the compact design take up the top third of the screen with a giant hero graphic Doesnt seem very compact Brutal concern incoming I just hope this doesnt ruin Reddit I like it the way it iswas The new profile page I dont like it It was easier to read my stuff before that change I can only imagine what similar stuff is in store for the rest of the site We dont want it Sorry I still think you guys are wasting a ton of screen real estate with this design Is there a way to opt out of it permanently Reddit on desktop feels like MySpace Not sure thats so great for the future Everyone has taste a few have good taste I used it for a little while and didnt like it at all Came back this version and didnt look back Hopefully well still have this as a legacy option after it launches or my Reddit days might be numbered after  years of being here having been stuck in card mode for days i just stopped using reddit entirely it was clearly made for mobile and it was unusable to me I dont like the idea of trying to emulate FacebookTumblr et al Reddit doesnt need to be social media It needs to have clear concise data and logs No massive image tiles and cluttered metro screens no profile pages Reddit didnt need a change for  years because it functions so well as it is Simplicity is often the best weapon The new redesign is a great example of overengineered Very disjointed Card looks horrible Youre basically angling to make it like facebook basically making it take longer to scroll through the feed so you retain viewership of your app for longer periods of time so the platform is more enticing to advertisers who also coincidentally can put up ads that look identical to actual posts now I think its horrible and for usability its an absolute downgrade Im sure it suits your purposes just fine so youre going to go ahead with it But it is an inferior product from the users perspective Especially once the log of my posts that I like to see when I click my name becomes a profile that you hope to use to fish more information from me for you to sell And lets not act like thats not coming I honestly cant name one thing that is better Whats something that you guys think is better about the new version How do I optout of this shit early Is there a dont change anything anymore please for the love of God stop turning into Digg box I can check off Because that classic dont look very classic Its hard to do a sidebysidebyside comparison of the  modes when you use different subreddits for each of the screenshots Hey can you fix the chat notification icon that Ive had for the past month despite the fact that Ive literally never used chat and no one has ever sent me a chat and Ive logged back in and out a hundred times and the fucking thing wont go away Thanks so much Why redesign something that everyone already loves Just so you can justify having a job But how do I know I can TRUST you redesign team Rising is broken This update is absolutely broken uamg This morning I opened up Reddit and was greeted by the redesign again I used it before and opted out because I did not enjoy it However now I cant opt out anymore Anytime I try Im just redirected to the front page So now Im stuck with this halfbaked attempt at Facebook The bugs I have encountered are numerous Some examples are  Not being able to access my settings and being redirected to the front page  Not being able to access my messages and being redirected to the front page Notice a pattern here  The title and votes being in a black background with black type so it becomes completely unreadable  Having to switch out of Fancy Pants Editor because it wont allow me to comment on anything at all The only thing that does seem to work correctly is the Submit Feedback button which I have used extensively all day reporting bugs and giving feedback This update is atrocious and is just plain frustrating This is approaching Digg levels of bad I feel like no one here asked for this to happen It is slowly but surely becoming Facebook and that is truly such a shame Whenif this update goes permanent and there is no option to go back to the old reddit I will delete all of my accounts and find something else Why is it so bad that mobile users choose to view the site in desktop format I dont want your website to force me into mobile mode every time I visit the page or hit next to view the next page As of the last hour this happened every Single Time I dont want your app I dont want your mobile mode I dont want to select the type of page I want to view every time I refresh the site This is annoying enough that Ill stop using reddit Ive been using this for a few weeks and hate the inline ads They need to be removed or better highlighted so I can ignore them They look too much like content If this stays Im going to find a new community Youre becoming Digg and Ive not see you address any real redesign concerns since Ive been onboard How do I not become apart of this I think it is pretty terrible and just want my old view back Is there a way to turn off the new idiotic profiles I know you can still do overview but is there a way to set that as default The opt out better be indefinite I hate the new layout Also the fact that I had to dig a bit to figure out how to switch it back to the old version is ridiculous The opt out button on the log in menu doesnt do jack Couldnt how to opt out of it permanently been listed on this post or at least a link to how to manage the two versions that now exist for some reason If you change my u page to the new profile Im out Simple as that I come to reddit because its unlike facebook twitter all those sites I dont want a profile I want a log Ive been here for over  years and the simple text is the best way to consume the most amount of knowledge data shitposts funny jokes etc If you make my shit like a profile page instead of just a text page Im out Ill probably be unsubscribing to these new looks of subs that are redesigned  its too much clutter Give me plaintext with links or give me deletion Thank god I finally found a button that took me out of the new interface Its a joke There is so much wasted space its not even funny And like many others have said I feel that this is an attempt to gear Reddit towards an audience that doesnt use it anyway therefore alienating the original users of this site The redesign is AWFUL It breaks the flair system and half of the options on the individual topics are not visible with clicking on some annoying dropdown menu It looks terrible it butchers usability and it breaks half of the sites core functionality I cant properly moderate anything with that abomination of an interface You still seem to have not addressed the question of why changes were needed at all We needed to refactor it to be able to add more features isnt an answer to this Its just circular reasoning presuming that more features were needed in the first case If you are interested in convincing anyone of the utility of a redesign you would need to articulate which new features it would enable and make a case for those being worthwhile Refactoring is a means not and end unto itself Reddit doesnt have technical problems it has community and administration problems It would be preferable to see the company focus on its actual issues rather than dumping resources into nonsolutions for nonproblems removed so stop trying to turn this into a mobile app Its a fucking website not an app Make the app look like its for kids keep the website clean of that shit Dont redesign reddit Honestly I spent  minutes in a preview of the redesign and noped right back out of it I really dont like it Especially the way it totally ignores window width and artificially limits the column displaying posts on the main page Redesigning reddit Changing the design that works and is not broken For what exactly Ad space I dont see how this could ever go wrong  Did they remove my ability to minimizehide comments If they did WHY Im incredibly frustrated right now In really long comment chains this helps me keep track of things and makes the giant scroll wall much much less of a giant scroll wall Opting out right away until thats fixed EDIT  I was wrong I keep accidentally going to the new layout via my reddit bookmarks and realized by accident that you can click the gray vertical stripe below the upvotedownvote to minimize that comment thread Id say thats fine if not particularly intuitive I was being very melodramatic I HATE this redesign It looks so overly calculated to be sleek and trendy when the old layout was perfectly serviceable and intuitive More welcoming I came here  years ago and the interface was and still is just fine We know what your end game is here and rest assured you will lose many users because of it It is absolutely hideous If this is the new norm for reddit Im out of here Everything takes  fucking seconds to load How do I opt out of this buggy piece of garbage Why was it shipped like this  I couldnt log in I had to go to some special SSL page to log in Every other login attempt from every other page failed  Items on the page will sometimes literally vibrate as if the whole page is trying to fall apart  The popups onclick are unintuitive and awful especially if Im using a smaller window that doesnt take up my full screen EDIT  Buttons not working and needing to reload the page  Reddit can be extremely complex It wasnt until you started implementing this shitshow Glad we still have the option to go back to the nonshit design To be honest the Classic theme aside which is somewhat palatable all the new themes are flat out horrible  Card looks like Reddit and Tumblr had a big ugly child that looks like those long forgotten blogs from the early  To put it Deadpool style it look like Freddy Krueger facefucked a topographical map of Utah Also having ads appear as posts is as honest as if you were trying to get us into some multilevel marketing scheme which to say the least is very VERY scummy  Compact on the other hand looks like the default theme Reddit has now but somehow broke halfway during the loading of the page and results in half the content going AWOL Alternatively it reminds me of those darknet websites you see in some shows on TVs that sell a whole bunch of illegal stuff So on one hand it looks like the design team got very drunk and broke a good part of the code and on the other it looks like Reddit became a website that sells illegal stuff All in all thats not exactly a good impression  Now as for the Classic theme the only problem it has as far as I can see is the font used which looks very close to Comic Sans MS and while Im sure theres people in your team that love shiba inus having the whole website look like an old meme straight out of rdoge isnt exactly a good way to make your site attractive Instead it looks like the team consists of year olds who are desperately trying to fit in with their grandkids by wearing rapper clothing and saying swag more often than a pornstar moans So the TLDR is that while I can understand the wish to give the site a refresh it really feels like you guys thought more about if you could do it and not much about if you should do it Is this why comments just arent showing up now in several subreddits I can post and get responses but when I look at the thread theyre not there This redesign is absolutely ugly as fuck  HORRID  Bad typefaces  More bad typeface mixed sizing again  Everything popped off the background into faux floating dialogs  My scrollbar is inches from the edge of my screen  Why would you break browser UX expectations which have been decades in the making edit Reading deeper I can see youre on the path to cycling out old annoying users as you slowly utilise the content they generate to build a new more advert friendly audience While one audience will slowly leave another more placid and malleable one will take its place Then you can turn off the old design Good luck on your future ventures youll be doing it without me Thanks Now my subreddit is broken because you still havent given us CSS so our spoilers are hanging out in the open like a giant swinging dick Thanks for nothing looks like shit youre forcing a shitty design as a default skin sometimes i want to catch up on the days event without logging in and posting etc cant do that now since the new design is soo fucking shit Aron Swartz is literally turning in the grave FUCK YOU refreshes rannouncementsnew sees new post Look its about rcircleoftrust  Which wannabe social media bullshit are you shoving up our ass this time deleted Eww Nice job you broke it The redesign is horrible I could only stand  minutes of that bullshit until I had to switch back you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top It didnt work I had to manually remove new from the URL I switched back because the top bar is the primary way I navigate reddit I go to a lot of individual subreddits and in the new design there is no easy way to do that As long as thats not there I wont be switching Please make this nightmare go away Your new design is useless garbage this is how digg died the question now is where can we go from here diggs redesign led to an exodus to reddit i know voat exists but its shitty and small and has low self esteem will it gather all the chaos emeralds then hide them away under its genitals then pawn them all in a spending spread for its crippling addiction to advertiser revenue like its fathers before it reddit and digg are we all doomed to an endless cycle of democratic aggregaters being slowly churned into corporate advertising platforms i thought it was cool but the scrolling doesnt work right on chrome i had to switch back it was too annoyingeverytime i tried to scroll down it would lag slightly like on the popups that showed when you click a link if you try to scroll and read the comments it would lag a second before it started moving or the same if you got to the bottom it wouldlag as you are scrolling up we are looking at you iredditcom As someone who uses iredditcom on mobile thanks for not killing it off I personally love the layout The definition between posts is clear Welp i cant see comments on certain threads I use Reddit from a desktop and so I dont need redesigns meant for mobile devices In fact I would like to be able to filter comments that are shorter than a  character tweet For me Reddit would be easier to use if I didnt have to see short comments as most of those do not contain much that is useful or interesting So I welcome retention of the existing presentation I especially want to be able to use Markdown Format even though I know that most people do not use it I would like it if more people used it and through the design its use were encouraged Absolutely horrific redesign the site is almost unusable its so bad Its almost as terrible as the official app normally this kind of stuff wouldnt bother me but its so unimaginable bad Im close to giving up My new Reddit is JACKED it wont let me logout switch back go into preferences nothing Not only that but I seem to be limited to how often I can post I just made a post in a different subreddit and now its making me wait  minutes to post this which hasnt happened to me since I was new on Reddit years ago Man I really hate this new design It reminds me the redesign that killed digg Why do I have to change back to the old reddit literally every time I click a link This is incredibly annoying If it aint broke dont fix it A saying reddits engineers seem to have forgotten When will you give us an option to disable infinite scroll Please do more testing on Firefox Its very buggy and slow Will this completely break RES until they update it I really did not like the new design It was way too bright with not enough information on a page It drew attention to things that werent important vote counts and hid important information like replies I switched back It was not a pleasant experience This redesign really sucks I have subreddits I dont want to subscribe to but I want to visit them via a shortcut Why would you get rid of that How does that even help Really not a fan of the redesign guys And it is extremely annoying when I have to keep going back to old reddit every time I log in Is there a way to permanently stick with the old reddit I do not like the new design The font on frontpage is shitI dont know I think I like it better to have slim fonts At least we have compact view and slide view of communities I subbed that was nice The notif button was different place right now that it was harder to check if theres a notif at all It was due to placement of it and it was small Popup post is not nice I usually condensed my screen to a small one for better viewing instead on a full screen view Add themes like in app  ALSO SOME FORMATTING LINK DOESNT WORK LinkhttpsiimgurcomwuLyfFppnghttpsiimgurcomwuLyfFppng how do i perma disable the new theme also how do i get it to stop introducing me to the new theme every time i log in or open a new tab The redesign looks like total shit Let me keep my legacy profile up The redesign has such small fonts I cant read it And has less functionality than the legacy profile I really cant understand anyone preferring the new profile Unless it allows Reddit to spy on us more easily and that is the purpose of the redesign Can you say digg redesign Can you say Zuck is going broke and going to jail Are you guys planning on adding subreddit filtering back on I browse rall more than I probably should but its one of the things keeping me from joining the redesign since Im not able to block certain subreddits that I dont feel like seeing for a variety of odd reasons Can we get rid of the ads that are designed to look like reddit posts Just give us ads Dont disguise them as fake posts Wouldnt it had been better to show card classic and compact effects on only one subreddit or even the frontpage How do I disable it i Hate it  How do I opt out Im not even in the redesign but the site seems a bit borked now allrising only has  posts and comments arent working in multiple subs I frequent Wow it looks like and feels like shit Sry for the bad wording and the awful feedback but it just does I cant stand the redesign I looked at it for a few minutes and had to leave It was murder on the eyes and hell I cant sign in to it I HAVE to sign in to the old one anyways I hope it never becomes mandatory  PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT  use oldredditcom to go back to the oldschool nonshitbookinstashit layout  END OF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT  This redesign looks horrble This new design is god awful I fucking hate it and if they take away oldreddit welp bye I hate the redesign Its soo AD HEAVY like very th post is an AD I understand the need for AD revenue but honestly this is bullshit Are you going the way of DIGG Because thats how you go the way of DIGG God I hate the new design Please tell me you arent planning on phasing out the old site If so Ill be forced to leave which would be awful Please STOP changing it to the new reddit design every three posts it is fucking annoying There is a reason I am not using the new design yet Why would you use three different subreddits with three different custom themes to demonstrate the difference between card classic and compact lol just use the same damn one so we can actually see how things change jesus christ how do i permanently see the legacy version the new version kind of sucks and im sick of having to click to see the legacy version Rising is broken Please dont get rid of it as its super helpful for fast moving popular subs like rpolitics I for one welcome our new corporate overlords Let the ads begin I fully admit to not fully reading this post But all I can think about after viewing the example images is that it looks so much like live journal Soo when are the Russians going to buy Reddit Classic mode is an objective downgrade from the current view Several useful functions such as save and report are hidden behind a shitty dropdown menu when there would be plenty of space to align them horizontally like they are now The pointless dropdown of death has also replaced the horizontal hotnewrising options at the top of every sub for some reason we now need two clicks to access anything that isnt hot and new users wont even realize that other options exist unless they specifically go looking for them One of the great things that made Reddit better than Facebook for me was that almost every function is immediately displayed on screen so I can know everything I can do on a page without having to rummage through annoying menus The update breaks that Found a little clever trick well its done commonly anyways but lol to let everyone test this out httpsnewredditcomhttpsnewredditcom  THANK ME LATER Use it while they still let you Protip To access beta of everything try adding beta or new before its domain lol Mostly works haha I cant switch back to the old reddit The option to do so on the upper right does nothing except reload the page in the new reddit I hate this design seems to be overexposed with bright colours The current design is fine Go back to old reddit doesnt work Log out doesnt work Im trapped in this hell This is turning into Digg A frame What is this  Did a  year old design this Change it back Low contrast you sadist The redesign is terrible for older readers I liked that I could scroll through and decide on a story based on the tiny picture and the text The text was large enough to read easily Now I have to either scroll through annoying and useless pictures that I cant close to find good news or on the Classic site the text is smaller because of the box on the righthand side If we want to opt out why cant we have it just the way it was a list of articles with small photos or videos we can choose to open WITHOUT the box on the right This redesign is hopeless I mean the looks isnt that hopeless the endless scrolling is idiotic autoplay of gifs and videos is obnoxious but the worst is its impossible to login httpsiimgurcomqcfOJjpghttpsiimgurcomqcfOJjpg This is what i get all the time or some variation of something expired Fucking sucks It looks fucking terrible Its like youre designing the site around mobilestablets but you already have a mobile site Its so fucking bad Youre going to end up killing this site The new UI is terrible The redesign SUCKS and you guys passive aggressively include the Go back option which is a big creamy load of bs lies bursting all over your face Not to mention all the nice new exciting generous data tracking ads Thanks reddit Thought we were friends Now let me clarify why this new version totally SUCKS  The subs menu at the top of the page is gone Which alone is enough to annoy me  The annoying scroll menu of subs on the side of the page now  The preview window doesnt work on pretty much every sub excluding most content on Home Page and loading is extra lag Plugged In Connection  The fact that I CANT GO BACK Nor did I ever even Optin in the first place What is wrong with you people Personally Im not a fan of the redesign I would like to keep everything exactly the same now and forever Ive switched back to the classic view and intend on keeping it there Thank you for keeping that option Hope you never do away with it Can anyone confirm these changes to be falling right in line with this comment about the banning of several subreddits httpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsxcjnewadditiontositewiderulesregardingtheusedwrwy Reddit seems to be continuing to sell out its userbase in favor of more advertising and becoming a social network akin to Facebook You know theres a very good saying about not fixing things that arent broken Even the classic theme just does nothing but add annoying new design trends that get in the way of smooth clean viewing I just want to look at the content on the site not be harassed by a giant overhead search bar that constantly feels the need to tell me that this is still Reddit Or view a layout thats overly centralized with uncomfortable amounts of wasted space because people are nearly incapable of designing a layout anymore that isnt designed for mobile viewers The fact that you will be still able to use the old design is amazing There are so many sites that have introduced terrible design choices which often make them unusableIm looking at you lastfm and usually they never back down from them and force you to use the changed site So props to you for that When will you add a preference to have your front page sorted by hot and not best as a default It gets annoying having to constantly switch it I just got the new layout and holy shit its fucking terrible Is it designed for people that are legally blind Before you can see like  posts on your screen at once and now you see half of one Who thought this looked good my elderly grandma that has never and will never use reddit Roll it all back and stop redesigning the interface Youre actively pushing users like me away from this site Facebook made the same mistakes you all are making new design looks like crap and give us a dark theme Looks worse and is less functional good redesign guys It fucking sucks The redesign is such trash Is this Reddits Digg v No thanks opted out Dislike can we set it to old reddit permanently  cant find the option dont like new reddit at all  it looks like  gag Man I hate this new reddit I really hate it Seems like its a downgrade Everything is worse So many things that are broken I cant even look at my messages for instance And I cant find a way to revert to the old reddit anymore Before it would ask me if I wanted to go back but now it never asks me anymore RIP reddit it was nice while it lasted redesign is trash  Furthermore we do not have plans to do away with the current site are you saying Reddit will never force users to use the new layout Or are you saying that after beta well give users a few weeks to adjust then force everyone Digs new design is what made you famous Who are you going to make famous Congrats Reddit you recreated Tumblr circa  How about you stop popping a window every few minutes asking to try the new design Right in the middle of reading an article or watching a video no less This is becoming like the Windows  to  update Well say no every time and eventually well have a permanent switch I swear to fucking god if the piece of shit new site pops up one more time Get it the fuck away Thanks Oh I see Youve added something to preferences and enrolled me against my will But even with it off you add some bullshit to the top ribbon uAmg any chance you guys can accept that I think this whole thing is a pile of shit and dont want to be involved This design gives me migraines  Some items change size on mouseover Zooming can trigger migraines It reliably triggers mine  The left side doesnt scroll with the rest of the page Sheer between staticfixed and scrolling elements can trigger migraines  Thats just what Ive already emcountered new design  fuck this i had to register to even browse top bar of main sub reddits is gone what the fuck this is garbage fire your designers and product mgrs seriously do they not understand reddits user base that is their job All I want to say is this redesign is fucking terrible and I dont want it This better not get forced on everyone at some point Looks like fucking Facebook now Fucking stupid Hey reddit just FYI your new format SUCKS The best thing about the redesign is that I now spend less time on Reddit Just some user feedback The redesign is absolutely awful The interface is not intuitive It feels sterile I keep switching back to the old version but it keeps defaulting to the new version I know how disappointing it can be to invest so much time and effort in something you want people to love so Im sorry to sound critical or like one of those I need to speak with the manager folks who you can never make happy Thanks for making the old site available to us who have had difficulty adapting to the new design this redesign is the worst thing ever made by humans  I appreciate the effort however I have to say I am not a fan of this redesign I am also concerned with what your intentions are for all this space you have created on the sides will used for Please no adds Why do you always have to fix things that arent broken Fuck you In beforehttpsiredditmediacomHULExBZWSXiMdtTIKTKMPOiVHUWDVsfmlMKFUpngsdcbdaeccf Seems like the site is experiencing technical difficulties Comments are not showing up and the rising section of rpolitics has no links Not sure if its related What if we dont want it I dont want this to become a social network I dont care who you people are i dont want you to know who I am a reddit replacement cant come soon enough Couldnt you have hired a graphic designer for the redesign This is even uglier than the old site It still looks like it was designed by programmers The colors are similar but more garish Normal things like viewing my previous posts are hidden Why does clicking on an image open the post instead of expand the image like before That worked well Now you have to click on the tiny expand button There are a ton of things like this that are just clunky Im a software engineer whos worked on multiple redesigns so Im normally forgiving of other sites being redesigned I know you needed to redesign the old site That was obvious Im not arguing for keeping that But this redesign really looks and feels very clunky The redesign is absolutely horrible KISSKeep It Simple Stupid The old format works just fine Its easy to navigate looks fine and gets the job done The redesign makes using the site a painful experience Please set Legacy mode as default one The new layout is not user friendly Reddit AKA Facebook Is this how Reddit dies An unneeded redesign Looks like shit OP Dont know if this is a known issue but the upvote display on mobile at least for me belongs in rsoftwaregore What the fuck is this circle thing There seems to be an issue with upvotedownvote registeringshowing server issue Does this have anything to with why rising isnt showing up on my app Whats wrong with the current design This is garbage how do we go back to classic Okay I got the new design and everything looks terrible I tried to opt out and it doesnt work I tried to log out of my account and I cant Then I tried to post here and got an error message In fact I cant post anywhere using the desktop version I just get an error saying This request to comment is invalid The only way I could even post this was by using the mobile version via my phone Essentially my reddit account on the desktop version is unusable now Wtf is going on I cant log in on the pc Keeps saying I either timed out or it cant process my request Login issues on PC Please advise Can you not You changed it now it sucks Its awful I hate it The blue button doesnt allow me to go back to the old site and when I click on the unread messages button it takes me to an error page How do we turn this off As of today it seems that New Reddit is the default on my browser which is a problem I personally find it extremely important that I be able to see the individual style of my various subreddits a feature that New Reddit apparently cripples  Is there a way to set the Old Reddit that I enjoy as a default over this worsetome New Reddit It just seems absurd to me that Id have to click travel back to Old Reddit each and every time that I open a new tab for a Reddit link so Im hoping that Im missing something  I appreciate why youve redesigned the site and how its an improvement in many ways over the existing layout but eliminating subreddit styles entirely is just not for me This redesign is terrible No thanks Stop This desktop update is not good you are going to lose a huge chunk of user base if you push this through It sucks How do I turn it off It hurts my eyes The new reddit is god awful youre not gaining any real estate in the new version and now youre losing a large portion of the side view yes you can minimize it I dont feel the site needs a redesign just a cleaning up The compact  classic  card addition is nice but adding an extra click to sort things or to get to your other subs is quite annoying I feel like youre making the user experience more complicated and thats the wrong direction to be going For any site I hate it So how do I go back to the old Reddit format Classic is not the same Kudos for trying something new but I really dont care for it ETA Ok just saw the oldredditcomhttpsoldredditcom Hopefully that remains an option  not a forced migration Looks like shit We dont need it Make dark theme already I dont like the new design I prefer the old good one please let us keep using the old one my opinions on Classichttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsunknownpng Compacthttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsunknownpng Cardhttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsunknownpng In other words compact is decent the rest is just fucked The redesign sucks hopefully RES unfucks it Theres really no where else to leave for so I guess enjoy mining our data and selling it to advertisers as this site slowly becomes nufacebook Static page elements big chunks of wasted spacerequired for touchscreens to prevent fatfingering distracting push content in the gutters random pieces of material design in a nonmaterial UI modal popups instead of links a failure to properly pageaka infinite scrolling these are all essentially a shift from mobilefirst to mobileonly design I deeply question your motivation for making these changes Holy shit this new layouts sucks Yikes this redesign is bad like really really bad almost unusable This is ugly and pretty much threw out all the work that I had done on the subreddits I worked on Dont really want to do it all over again what a pain The new redesign is to busy and way to spread out to big images makes browsing slower and more annoying Is there a way to undo my access to the redesign I dont like it and its annoying to have to go to oldredditcom instead of just redditcom Is there a way to redirect all my redditcom links to oldredditcom or otherwise disable the redesign permanently I HATE IT the infinite scrollinglack of pages especially arrrfffghjgfkdjhgksdjf Yuck The redesign navigates and looks like a mobile site on a desktop That is not a good thing Thank you for letting us opt completely out The redesign is very very bad Functionality is much worse all around The new design feels like a website that was designed in  Its clunky slow and is super ugly If you change to this design mark my words  this place will go the way of digg And Ill be on the first boat out And will there be a way to make it sort by hot instead of best as default rising is rip Does it come with even more sneaky tracking Card view looks like a spawn of Tumblr during a midlife crisis Please dont make it default I really like the compact view It shows plenty of text in a clear delineated format Classic is OK the fonts look a bit too big in the example deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk Fuck your redesign If aint broke then dont fix it Remember digg You guys are lighting your own fire here Im actually really enjoying the redesign for browsing Thanks everyone who listens to feedback in rredesign and fixes stuff that breaks I didnt like it at first but its getting so much better  Digg  comes to mind Ill miss you reddit How about stop changing how reddit mobile looks Its becoming more and more cluttered mobile sucks I have a question not related to the announcement Is it just me who missed it or did we not have an April Fools thing this year Normally its announced in either announcements or blog right Whats going on with the mobile app Not sure if its just me but Top posts for Now only show min posts not Top posts in the last hour Congrats  you suck at ui design God damn The redesign is fucking terrible and not only that the performance sucks While the redesigned website does look nice keeping the old one around indefnietelyy or at least for a long time is probably the right move There are always going to be people that want CSS or have some gripe with the new website and this is probably the best way to satisfy both crowds Fuck the admins And thus it begins We already lost rfunny and rpics Who knows what subs will get get a flood of new users and have its quality plummet Will Rising be an option in the future I like being able to find material thats not already hours old or newmemes circlejerks Where do I submit bug reports for the new design But wheres the April fools gag Do you have a time line of when this will go into effect the whole of reddit Whatever youre doing I wont like it and Ill complain and thats a guarantee Patent lending trademark incorporated Quarantined subs are completely inaccessible on the Reddit mobile app Guys can we get every sub quarantined No ads To avoid going in too deep on this mess how about just giving us an optout of this so we dont get flashing warning signs whenever we go on certain subreddits I dont need reddit covering my ears whenever daddy says a curse word ragainstmensrights is a blatant hate sub and their mods used the platform to dox a guy and file a false police report against him Should that have any consequences or Nah thats cool I am seriously livid that I cant view WPD on mobileAs morbid as it may sound its my second most visited sub People deal with the problems they face in life different ways How you might respond to a challenge might be different from mine How you might deal with depression might be different that mine I say that to say this I lost my daughter on  I reached out to people on multiple platforms for help For advice For a open ear For arms to wrap around me For someone to just fucking tell me its going to be ok Im not saying the WPD community doesnt have some cunts in it but it also has some of the most passionate down to earth realistic human beings Ive ever met Ive had more conversations about death and the reality of it on this sub than any other plat form Ive tried using Ive had conversations last for days and weeks and have had people check in on me I had to live through the horror of feeling my daughter get cold in my arms thats why I am here To see that the life Im currently living in is something that we are all going to have to face There is a video on here and most will know which one I am talking about its the video where the brick comes through the truck window and although you cant see what happened you hear the husband reacting to it for a solid minute or so That video makes people cringe and some people say its harder to watch than the cartel videos For me when I hear it I cry every time I watch it every time but I cry every time as well I cry because it literally takes me back to the exact moment where my wife and I found out our daughter died Those cries of pain and sorrow and helplessness are forever burned into my brain but they are my wifes cries that I hear when I watch that video Watching stuff like that makes me just understand that someone somewhere knows what I am going through and it comforts me  in a sick way  to know that someone else knows the exact pain I feel Id rather watch that video X then have another conversation of someone telling me that they dont know how I feel but Ill be ok I just need to accept that God wanted a Angel So now to find out that I cant come to this site on mobile  mobile redditor here I am devastated This sub is literally where I go to escape the fact that my daughter is in a box in a Cairo cabinet in my bedroom Yall are fucking up reddit You really are Cool Your website is going to shit anyway Have fun with a front page full of reeeeeeesist and astroturfing Also youre a piece of shit hypocrite arguing for net neutrality but censoring and quarantining many subreddits that arent even offensive YOU JUST WANT TO STOP THEIR MESSAGE Will we get a list of all subreddits quarantined or will someone have to create a script Lists will exists whether you create it or a user does Quarantined communities generate no revenue Can users in there buy gold and gild stuff rTheRedPill is banned Because it doesnt follow your ideology You can read many stories of man on the verge of suicide finding purpose in their life through that subreddit but i guess its not adfriendly Genuine question What is the purpose of requiring a verified email to view quarantined subreddits My  cents Theres a nice talk Richard Dawkins gave on the subject of free speech and during it he rhetorically asks Who would you nominate to decide what youre allowed to read Try to think of who would be most appropriate to tell you what newspapers youre allowed to read what movies you can see what food you can eat Who do you nominate To whom do you delegate the task of deciding what is right and wrong for you I think the administration is trying really hard to be that person and I dont like that Were all grownups we can decide for ourselves what we do and dont want to see I can see the value in having a warning but putting up hurdles and making things deliberately difficult is ridiculous Today we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings including adding an appeals process where none existed before Not having the old policy memorized what specifically are the changes from what it was before compared to now aside from an appeals process Are there actual additional categories which can merit a quarantine More defined characteristics of existing categories Or are other changes also mostly administrative On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit there will sometimes be communities that while not prohibited by the Content Policy average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting In other cases communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes yes we used that word that warrant additional scrutiny as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate eg the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented In these circumstances Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine Fair enough Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly optin to viewing the content similar to how the NSFW community warning worksQuarantined communities generate no revenue do not appear in nonsubscriptionbased feeds eg Popular and are not included in search or recommendations So this is a way of making sure that advertisers dont find their products displayed on racist subreddits alternative truth hoax subreddits or other such unsavory corners of Reddit Does the Wont appear on rpopular also apply to rall I get that certain content or opinions go beyond the confines of free speech However what Im seeing now is that the personal opinions of the Reddit admins determine what subs get quarantined and not some legal line in the law Blatant racism is obviously unwanted Anything that violates local laws advocating for harm etc is obviously unwanted The problem is that feelings are now apparently also a qualifier If a sub offends someone it gets quarantined Subs are getting quarantined and banned left and right based on nothing but some vocal majority being offended and not liking the opinion of that sub in general Even if the content itself isnt illegal in any way its the sheer fact that someone doesnt agree that is enough to get a sub in trouble To name some examples having different opinions on genders isnt illegal Yet some subs that are critical of the whole LGBTA alphabet soup spectrum are being quarantined or even banned Based on what exactly Some group of people feeling offended by it and demanding the admins take action against an alternative opinion on a subject TRPs quarantine is another example of this Discussing the sexual mechanics between men and women isnt illegal But because it touches on a controversial point of view that some people dont agree with it gets quarantined Its  and there are entire movements out there that will get offended at just about anything These are people who will get mad offended feel personally attacked and will demand that everything that does not fit their world view is censored and removed But being offended does not make you right or even justified in feeling that way I for one am deeply offended by horses If I can get a couple of hundred people to proclaim their hate of horses along with me will Reddits admins quarantine rHorses After all you wouldnt want it  accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so Point is this and this goes out to Reddit admins and all the special snowflakes complaining about things that offends them You can disagree with someones opinion all day long But the second you want to silence someone for having a different opinion than you you are literally no different than the worst regimes and governments the world has known in history If Reddit proclaims itself to be open and diverse then censoring content based on the opinion of a vocal minority is the entirely wrong direction to go in TLDR This  On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit there will sometimes be communities that while not prohibited by the Content Policy average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting should NEVER be a reason to censor ANYTHING Period Youre not my dad Give us an uncensored mode that makes Reddit work as if none of this happened please You can even leave it off by default I dont like other people thinking for me Wouldnt this make these communities echo chambers where outsiders arent even aware of what is being said Wouldnt this also make it less likely that reportable offences get reported Great new censorship My fav is the throttling Great that it only allows one side of the story to get out And then being able to harass the commenter because they cant respond Awesome Keep up the good work With the admins help we will be able to drive actual discussion off this site That way only one opinion will be had by all and we can celebrate this utopia that we work towards And nobody will be able to argue because theyll be banned or throttled or removed Great times The redpill was quarantined and the message For information on positive masculinity please see the resources available at Stony Brook Universitys Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities was attached That paper was authored by this womanhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSallyMillerGearhart who stated The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately  of the human race so that is now Reddits official position Good thing is post history in those subs is hidden so automatic bans from left subs wont work and neither will tagging posters from other subs Platform as open and diverse as RedditWhich is why we are quarantining subreddits we choose to not agree with We are doing this for YOUR benefit and safety All subreddits are equal except these that we are quarantining This is about diversity and inclusionary principles We are keeping these ones mostly out of view so that we may be better together without some though cuz we quarantined them We must stay united in the defense of what we determine to be acceptable free speech and violating these principles will lead to a ban Thank you for participating in the open and diverse platform that is Reddit This quarantine is fucking stupid and just anther way to enact censorship for the already shilled reddit Your goal is to reduce traffic to something by obfuscating it The Streisand effecthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiStreisandeffect and the Cobra effecthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCobraeffect suggest that this may not work Either you fully ban something or you treat it the same Trying to pull off a clever middleground may bring more attention to the content you thought you were hiding As a wise man once said do or do not there is no try You cant stop people from curating repositories of quarantined content For example  you want people to use upvotesdownvotes as a way to hide uninteresting or unimportant content but they dont Just look at the votes on this thread The post has  upvotes indicating that people use the votes as an agreedisagree button Oof People will do what they do with complete disregard for developer intentions Our colleagues at Facebook know this all too well Another example  DRM Many studios are ditching DRM because it suffers from the Cobra effect The stronger the DRM the more people want to hack it This could be no different By treating controversial topics specially you may inadvertently bring more attention to them thereby defeating the purpose I predict that this is the precursor to mass censorship on Reddit There are only two stable states and quarantining is not one of them Either you full ban or dont  Thats the decision you are choosing to defer until later Youll eventually have to decide you will not be able to avoid this decision We could see it in months maybe in years It depends on your colleagues at Facebook Twitter and Google Whatever rabbit hole they go into other social media platforms will eventually follow why unsubscribe me from the quarantined subs tho if im subscribed i obviously dont need it to be hidden from me Is there a way to view all quarantined subreddits At least is there a way to know whether a sub is quarantined or not removed The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so or viewed without appropriate context Clearly not otherwise you wouldnt require an email validated account and desktop access to proceed to view such a community Youre not just asking people to say I accept this shit might fuck me up youre throwing hurdles in their way even when they want to view it Now if you want to bleed a subreddit dry by doing that its your choice  you run the site it is your decision Just dont be disingenuous about it  this thread is full of people who see through you and who are becoming increasingly resentful of your attitude towards them People may not like your decision but if you treat them with enough respect to be honest about it they may very well return that respect to some degree Now as for how this effects the overall user experience we all know this doesnt end with rCringeAnarchy or the more sociallypolitically risky subs like rTheRedPill  eventually it leads to anything not asinine and inoffensive being hidden away I love cat pictures as much as anyone but thats not the only reason were here Since rFULLCOMMUNISM has been banned the following message appears one goes to the sub  This community is quarantined  It is dedicated to shocking or highly offensive content For historical information on communism please see the resources available at the Project on the Reconciliation of European Histories httpseureconciliationeuinstitutionspromotingawarenessandremembranceofcommunistcrimes Why add this blatantly biased historical information on communism Are any subs that advocate communism grounds for a ban or was there a specific infraction If it was a specific infraction I dont think the link is necessary Is it just the posts from a quarantined subreddit that are excluded from search or will the subreddit itself be excluded from search Id like to be able to find all subreddits when searching The optin warning upon visiting should be enough warning that the subreddit may be unsavory As part of an ongoing project involving Reddit Ive been cataloging some information about popular subreddits Ive compiled a list of around  of the most popular active and public subreddits and collected some general APIrelated information about them As luck would have it I tested the collection of this data this morning and so I have a table of around  rows of subreddit info Prior to this post I filtered that data by quarantinestatus just out of curiosity and it turns out that none of the subreddits I collected information for are quarantinedhttpsimgurcomWolPfI I wondered to myself what the point of the quarantine feature was if literally no subreddits of the top  had been quarantined since to my knowledge communities still just get bannedremoved as with before its existence I didnt have anyone to ask about that until  minutes ago So uh I guess you guys are going to use this feature more going forward And will it have any impact on the ability of the Reddit API to interact with those communities Edit Occasionally the quarantine attribute in queries to infojson comes back as null rather than true or false to public communities that show in the frontend as quarantined such as with rIcePoseidon httpswwwredditcomapiinfojsonidtaelr  is that how the API is going to respond when a community is quarantined Edit  As Ive noted elsewhere Ive since discovered that the quarantine property appears to return null if the subreddit is quarantined but you the user has not explicitly accepted the quarantine warning It returns true if you have accepted that warning What level of transparency can we expect from the appeal process It sounds to me that reddit is more interested in controlling a narritive that they agree with rather than allowing open discussion of controversial topics People have a right to be offended Just because they are offended doesnt make them right It is not your duty reddit to protect individuals from from wrong think points of view It is your duty to produce a platform that allows multiple points of view no matter how false incorrect or controversial so people can decide for themselves I feel that this update is the first step of many steps that will be taken to justify censorship of controversial subs that are unaligned with the value of the rulemakers Filtering out and de legitimizing opinions in the name of protecting the public in a slippery slope to tread In the end leads to radical censorship that does not support the foundation of the first amendment but instead creates a one sided narrative that will be misinformed and toxic to anyone who disagrees with our corporate fathers Will you be quarantining rEmpireDidNothingWrong That sub is a disgraceful fraud of galactic history Whelp no more reddit for me What a joke Anyone who can read between the lines knows that this is obvious censorship This site used to be a good representation of all that the internet had to offer So much for that The thought police are at it again You are not the ministry of speech Stop pretending to be If your political ideology wasnt obvious before it is now Are people really stupid enough to support something like this To think that only a few decades ago this would have generated unanimous outrage Oh how far the world has fallen Linking an outside source that the admins deem related to the content of the quarantined sub is beyond idiotic Linking to a source about communist atrocities on the quarantine page of fullcommunism Seriously Im not even remotely communist but thats not a disagreement with the hateful content on the redditwhich there was plenty of but rather seemingly a disagreement with ideology You cant ban a reddit simply because its communist and reddit didnt but that link definitely makes it look like any type of communist thought is not allowed Which is ironically a bit communist xB Same with the redpill Yes they had offensive content but ban them for that Dont ban them for their ideology and then link to an alternative source on how people should view masculinity Neither that source or the redpill are correct Its simply opinions Reddit inserting their own opinions and ideology is actually kind of disgusting xB Even with  truth im kind of uncomfortable with them linking to a government source on what really happened Just ban them if you dont want them spreading something you deem misinformation on your website Going the extra step from theyre wrong to Also heres what is right just doesnt seem like something a faceless website should be doing Can I be an admin and selectively quarantine subreddits we disagree with too ulandoflobsters You are aware that the link posted on the quarantine page of rbraincels is misleading The founder of Men and Masculinities studies at Stony Brook University Michael Kimmel was accused of sexual harassment multiple times yet the Reddit link redirects to multiple studies and articles by him Maybe do your research next time and provide a link to studies of masculinity that werent researched by a known sexual harasser I think the admins have a difficult task and I appreciate the work you do to keep Reddit safe and sane while not becoming as censorious and arbitrary as other large websites I want to register that I think its wrong that you linked to an anticommunism website from rFULLCOMMUNISM Im not a communist and I think its a fact that communists have done some horrible things as have capitalists etc but its blatantly biased that you chose to do that instead of linking to a neutral or nonviolent procommunist website Thats diminishing my faith that this is a nonbiased and fair process based on the content of the subs Is there a way for users to opt out of this ie I dont need to be shielded from what you deem offensive and would like quarantined subreddits to be visible on popular and all Also is there a list of quarantined subs I would like to see a list of them so that I can specifically subscribe to any that may be of interest to me in order to make sure I see their content I appreciate that you want to protect your more sensitive users but many people myself included view this as censorship and do not wish to engage in it Of course reddit is a private platform and you can do whatever you want but as a user I would like the ability to decide for myself what subs I deem offensive rather than having reddit babysit me Any reason why these quarantines look ideologically motivated The custom message behind some of todays quarantines brings into question the motivation behind limiting some of these subreddits abilities So addressing the elephant in the room is this going to affect td ureddit once promised  We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal Why is reddit steadily moving away from this Why are quarantines necessary Why do I have to give up my email address to view content reddit finds objectionable I guess this follows the new movement away from freedom of speech and toward the prohibition of any groups that diverge from what is socially acceptable Good in most cases but limits social change and categorically opposed to what the united states were founded on I guess because its a private company that runs the platform they can do what they want but when everyone relies on companies for news media that are able to choose what people get to see we have censorship This quarantine is an attempt at forcing ideological conformity Its intellectual intimidation ulandoflobsters Come on Really You quarantine rwatchpeopledie That sub is the most interesting thing on the entirety of the internet and you make it impossible to sub to and shite I can still access it just fine you colossal cunts but its so damn annoying having to search it up every time Honestly this was by far my favorite sub and you try to censor it like the fucking idiots you are This is really getting me pissed how is it possible for the retarded team at reddit to make hundreds of thousands of people hate you with the flip of a switch Seriously now with all the sincerity I can gather Go fuck yourself and shove some pointy sticks up your arse while youre at it On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit lol Its ironic how just yesterday I was explaining to my friend why reddit is such a fantastic place because censorship exists only within the subreddits  The freedom was what made this place amazing Now were just one step closer to losing what made this site special Front page of the internet my ass Quarantine is another word for we disagree with you and are soft deplatforming your community As long as no one is advocating violence or criminal acts you should let people do as they please Otherwise reddit will become an echochamber since everyone who you disagree with will go elsewhere The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so or viewed without appropriate context BULL FUCKING SHIT Of the subreddits Im subscribed to and that have been quarantined they no longer even appear in my subreddit list The ONLY WAY I can continue to participate in subreddits such as these in which I am actively subscribed to is to manually input said subreddits URL in my address bar and go to it that way This isnt accidentally coming across these subs this is you telling those subs subscribers to not go there anymore I do not believe reddit has the foresight or intuition or integrity to determine for me what is or is not appropriate This is an attempt at censorship that is only effective as an idea Deciding for others what is acceptable is done on what possibly basis Who at reddit gets to decide these things and what possible qualifications could they have to merit this promotion I dont know a single person other than I who knows what I want better what makes this any different than a form of thought police This is not sarcasm who gives you the right to arbitrarily decide who gets the freedom to exist in subreddits on reddit without isolation and demonetization As said by Rosa Luxemburg If freedom becomes a privilege the workings of political freedom are broken Also Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters or those who think differently As someone who knows that the Holocaust actually did happen I believe the right of individuals to hold the opinion personally and within communities forming subreddits that say the Holocaust did not happen is as much deserving of protection as any other persons beliefs This is nothing minor in nature but rather a large scale misguided way or trying to protect the innocent but in the end I feel as though this new tool possibly weapon will be used to beat down opinions and beliefs held by individuals not in agreement with those held by the staff of reddit or large majorities of any kind existing on reddit As put forth by Christopher Hitchens do not take refuge in the false security of consensus Do not try silence or isolate those who are not in a safely held majority of any kind Let all be heard and let all decide for themselves what to believe Anything less is a not only removal of the right to be heard but also of everyone elses right to listen Remove this feature and throw away the key if you as a company have any respect for the freedom of speech From a subreddit that is discussing some of these changes  I understand and can look past quarantining rsubreddit but you completely lose any moral high ground you might have had emphasis on might with regards to the quarantine when you then inject your own ideology into it Then it turns into authoritarianism and fuck that noise Its one thing to not welcome something on your platform but this comes across as extremely aggressive Some would even say extremist So in the word of that poster thanks for being   skeezy as fuck The quarantine of rFULLCOMMUNISM is blatant propaganda and proves that admins are fascists trying to cover their asses with PR TD has literally advocated for violence on multiple occasions and regularly violates the terms of service of reddit The censorship of rFULLCOMMUNISM links to debunked ahistorical propaganda nonsense Reddit admins are censoring valid political ideas that threaten Reddits revenue and profitability The admins are sanitizing reddit of leftist views even though these views do not violate any of the terms or service  The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so or viewed without appropriate context Good old fashioned censorship But we are doing it to save you from yourselves guys dont worry Listen you dont need to come to reddit to trip over some awful shit on the internet You guys are just finding a justification for censoring content Its that simple Subs like rwatchpeopledie or rsexworkers or rlipsthatgrip will not have not ever hit rall Youre going to shoot yourselves in the foot with the censorship bullshit thinking youre going to be rolling in cold hard advertiser cash Your users dictate the volume of traffic and the content You start minimizing content you will segment more and more of your user base until nobody is left Reddit is slowly becoming the next Digg and MySpace Reddit slowly dying This is stupid The internet worked just fine before thinskinned pussies started censoring anything even slightly offensive How about if you dont like a sub you just dont go to that sub Theres a difference between being an impartial moderator of content and acting as an advisor I understand where Reddit is coming from limiting access to toxic environments considering minors visit this site but acting as a parental figure for adults is a slippery slope to say the least Id prefer Reddit not babysit at all and let adults decide for themselves what they want to see but since that most likely wont happen the next best approach for Reddit would be to quarantine blatantly toxic subreddits without slipping into an advisory or parental role as this inevitably leads to subjective bais and proselytizing the company and admin ideology If they try this approach it will probably backfire They must exercise a cautious hand With that said there has to be some distinction between ideas that are uncomfortable such as differing political and religious opinions and ones that are hateful This has been said a million times before Its no secret that these are closely intertwined sometimes nearly indistinguishable Thank polarization and radicalization for that As such a system of checks and balances is very much needed In fact finding balance might very well be the challenge of our times what with the proliferation of information online and cultural triggers As for Reddit community diligence is in order although we also need to understand that at the end of the day Reddit is a forprofit business Can you explain why rguns is blacklisted from rpopular while A Not being in quarantine B Being one of the largest subs on the site C Having strict moderation and fairly straightforward posting rules Its literally just pictures of peoples guns its not even slightly different from any of the carrelated subs you arent going to reply to this because it would involve way to much fucking honesty about what the fuck you people are doing to everyone on this social platform youve come under control off  but can you add a function to turn off quanterentine notifications instead of forcing it on everyone i dont need your stupid warning its annoying and gets in the way of my experience which is the function of your decision here not actually protecting anyone  thats a goddamn pathetic facade of morality if i ever heard one why dont you let people choose if you they care about your stupidly retarded plots at social control which are never going to work and will only serve to fuck this species further  instead assuming everyone wants to be treated like an asinine sheeple So basically were going to make communities we find offensive or disagree with unavailable to view to the general public unless you directly look it up Reddit isnt open and diverse Its nothing but pushing ads and agendas while getting rid of things you dont like under the guise of hate speech and other bullshit Quarantine Function  The safe space Seriously I cannot imagine what in the world lead you to believe this would ever not blow up in your face All this will do is end up highlighting if your site is taking more action against one political allignment or not and you will end up having to actually defend why you are choosing to take action You dont seem to understand the value of what companies like Valves approach to Steam is when they decide to truly remain neutral and not believe people are too stupid to wonder the internet without having things removed from their eyes in advance Just a reminder that censorship never stops at one point If youre willing to let it happen to others dont be surprised if it happens to you How could you possibly measure what offends people in a reasonable way Whats the criteria to measure this Your going to quarantine subreddits based on other peoples opinions and feelings even though those subreddits did not break the content policy This sounds like censorship  The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so or viewed without appropriate context I find this offensive If you dont like a sub or know of a sub that you disagree with then you dont have to click it or subject your self to its content plain and simple I am a person I have a brain I can think for myself If I choose to read something that offends me thats my choice It sounds like reddit just wants people to read what they deem to be Correct How can people even be constructive without being disagreeable or offensive at times You cant grow with out doing those things Your taking away what reddit really is Not everything is always sunshine and rainbows or has to make everyone feel good You dont like it Dont subscribe or read it I feel like this is a sign that Reddit is going down the wrong path Throughout this sites history its been famous for actually representing the internet community Unfortunately this seems like the beginning of the end with that Mass censorship never starts with outright blocking of a large amount of information but instead begins with a seemingly innocent event like this Im not saying thats exactly where its going to go from here but theres really nowhere to go but down There will always be lies and misrepresented facts within a community like this but in the end they are outweighed by the fact that freedom balanced out by mods and administrators is better for the spreading of true information Probably been said before but just in case the source for historical information on communism stands out like a sore thumb compared to the links for the other subs Its a post on a free Wordpress blog by an anticommunist ssomething linking to a myriad of compromised sources Even if there are credible ones amidst them the sheer amount of propaganda outlets and organizations with ties to the far right listed completely dashes any hope of this resource having been compiled with even a modicum of intellectual honesty Basically what I read Reddit will continue to allow for the filteringcensoring of content deemed subjectively inappropriate or not worthy Communism is a valid more than one hundred year long worldwide political ideology and is basically in every country of the world respresented with a party  in the case they are not banned And banning the communist party is historically a method of fascists suppressing workers And afaik the communist party is not banned in the US so how can the satirehub of this ideologytalking about rfullcommunism  be quarantined and publically be smeared with rightwingpropaganda without producing an outcry by the liberals removed Still bullshit censorship do any subs other than thedonald have special admin protection Are you ok with reddit being associated with a partisan shoddilymade wordpress site like this one now posted on the sidebar of FullCommunismhttpseureconciliationeuinstitutionspromotingawarenessandremembranceofcommunistcrimes as somehow educational Are their any attempts to be transparent or neutral in redditapproved educational material Does reddit have a financial interest in promoting their approved educational sites like that wordpress site What about subreddits infected with fake accounts for the purpose of spreading misinformation rthedonald had a very exposing post about there being multiple fake accounts spreading proTrumpProRussian propaganda will you be quarantining those types of subredditsaccountscommunities After  comments nobody is going to read this one but I have to say it Reddit Im an adult I have been one for a long time now and I dont need anyone to policy what I read or see Fucking quarantine Jesus christ someone destroy this site already Quarantined communities generate no revenue Does that mean that you will not be able to give or receive gold on quarantined subreddits  Frankly I dont understand why you would want a middle ground between banned and allowed If youre not comfortable taking a subreddit down how do you justify limiting it Thank God I was worried Id have to use my brain when on this site Now I can finally only subject myself to ideas similar to my own and live in peace The only propaganda I want to inhale is the propaganda Reddit approves of Reddit is one of the most censored mainstream websites up right now lol open and diverse are you out of your fucking mind Quarantine policy is a form of censorship lol What happened to this site This is disgusting It is not your job to incentivize or disincentivize any behavior That is the job of the individuals deciding what they do and do not want to see for themselves and taking action accordingly Stop with this authoritarian wrong think policing bullshit So in other words you are just going to arbitrarily censor subs that have content you dont like hence why rfullcommunism is quarantined but rthedonald is not Thank you for proving our point Censorship if Ive ever seen it Dont like it Just report it and well hide it from everyone so no one else will ever have to see it Thanks Big Brother Is there a list of which subs you quarantined I want to sub to most of them or at the least have them all visible so you dont get to pick and choose what you think I might be offended by thanks Deleting reddit none of the subreddits I use have been quarantined although I do check out TD every now and then as an Australian interested in seeing what the American right is saying as it isnt really spread outside of places like pol which are deplorable but at the same time the idea that a subreddit I could have seen has instead been quarantined because YOU believe those OPINIONS shouldnt be spread on a platform that was designed purely for discussion governed by a simply upvotedownvote system disgusts me I hope people migrate to other platforms which allow discussion without the personal grievances of the people up top who clearly think they are better judges of good values and character than anyone else out of millions of users ranging from homeless addicts to multiple phd holders to working parents to billionaires LOL quarantining rFullcommunism is a fucking joke you did it for ideological reasons and you know it Preventing casual users from reading content from there my ass you even put that stupid link to that propagandistic trash on the quarantine page You are just creating your little liberal echo chamber for newcomers and on top of that you didnt even quarantine subs like TD that has been showed to be breaking the content policy So given the amount of people who say that rTheDonald is offensive why isnt it a quarantined community  Quarantined communities generate no revenue Say no more What are the parameters for a sub reddit being quarantined It seems very subjective and there is precedent with other social media sites ie YouTube Facebook and Twitter censoring political opinions of people on the right unfairly I dont want that to happen with reddit since historically this site has allowed people to mostly say what they want unless they are threatening someones security or health etc Yay more censorship based on mob mentality of who declares whats wrong and right every decade God bless the internet deleted What kind of fuckery is this rfragilewhiteredditors a hate sub still appears to be up This is good news I have a very sensitive intellect So having to see other people who think or feel differently than me causes undo anxiety Censorship is always the best policy You shouldnt ban anything We should be able to read and post anything we want Why arent you able to access quarantined subs from mobile Its unfair to the people who use mobile almost  I would occasionally scroll through WPD to get a refreshed sense of caution to take care of myself and my body I honestly dont understand why it was quarantined while being mostly respectful but subreddits that actively call for violence against people didnt I just want to be able to participate in that community again Imagine thinking rIcePoseidon is shocking So is td under quarantine yet tfw free speech is just limited speech Seriously though I hate how protective the world is becoming He hurt my feelings daddy help Boofuckinghoo sweetheart Like holy shit its like people forgot to grow the hell up So you censored and deleted reddits that you dont agree with We are not the thought police Its not the role of a private company to decide what people cannot say Spez What happened to that Why didnt you give people time to update rules if you were going to change them I will never buy a single product I see advertised on this website If you are a company purchasing AD space from reddit I will go out of my way to buy from your competitors If youre going to ruin my favorite website in order to make yourselves more AD revenue than Ill do everything I can to undermine that effort This is just going to make the respective subs more popular Congratulations you played yourself More Reddit censorship fuck off I cannot believe how many people are willing to allow censorship to happen Congratulations on taking another step to turning yourself into Facebook First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out Because I was not a socialist Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out Because I was not a trade unionist Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me Where can I get the list so I know where the cool reddits are classic leddit quarantining communism disgusting in this era the entire internet is going through quite a rough patch  So this totally isnt about the midterms right In other cases communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes yes we used that word that warrant additional scrutiny as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate eg the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented In these circumstances Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine So I take issue with this attitude If something is so clearly factual then why would there be the need to censor people that claim the opposite Wouldnt it be super easy to just go to their Reddit and give your evidence as to why they are wrong Youre just giving those people fuel to keep their conspiracy going Censorship is probably the biggest form of oppression that will yield the opposite result of what you want every time Youre just giving people more reasons to believe theyre right  The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so or viewed without appropriate context Weve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes So youre basically putting them in the Gulag to have them learn from their mistakes Of course people will be more careful if theyre being censored But underneath theyre boiling with anger when theyre being censored for writing their opinion which is honest as can be And theyll only feel more so that theyre right BECAUSE theyre being oppressed xB Reddits slide down the slope of fascism continues why is rwhitebeauty qurantined but not rblackbeauty Cx CX deleted rIcePoseidon was just quarantined Apparently the mods were told nothing in advance Could you give a reason for why you chose to quarantine it or at least tell it to sub moderators so they can actually act in the message you send them I am assuming quarantine is done by manual review so you must have the reason stored anyway Also rIcePoseidon was briefly listed as a target on rTheBanout did this have affect on sub banning on reddit Youve quarantined rFULLCOMMUNISM and linked to rightwing anticommunist propaganda as evidence of the horrors of Communism Question Do you plan to ban subreddits that defend the UK for their inentional genocide of millions of Indians in British Raj The Bengal Famine  Do you plan to ban proUSA subs or subs that cheer on US foreign wars and interventions Or are some kinds atrocities okay and others arent Presumably the deciding factor is doesdid the atrocity in question serve the interests of the United States the West and Capital Dont get me wrong Im  down for making containers for communities that dont really fit with the Reddit Culture for lack of a better way to say it I love freerange sites like chanch and really enjoy reading the off the wall over the top stuff from rdemocrats and rTheDonald alike but thats gotta be hell to monetize and even worse to manage when youre trying to keep a clean look for the site as some form of public forum But something Ive seen as someone whod consider themself liberally biased when are we going to quarantine rpolitics rLateStageCapitalism rPoliticalHumor etc The few times Ive been to those boards Ive seen pretty heavily upvoted posts with hostility threats of violence appeals for violence etc Theyre just hostile circlejerks that really dont add to a public forum setting I know the don and a small amount of right leaning boards that have questionable at best intentions have gotten hit  why has the same not happened to the left leaning boards that are doing the same thing I know that Reddit has traditionally leaned a bit left and thats perfectly okay  everybody and every organization has some kind of bias  politically morally what have you But lets apply the rules evenly at the very least Hate is hate appeals for violence are appeals for violence regardless where you stand on the political spectrum Thank you Thought Police Congratulations on out doing China for a frighting social dystopian that censors all thought or wrong think Hopefully Voat will have section that targets your advertisers and investors deleted Who juges what is offensive or what is not Religion politics seduction techniques economy UFOs parenting sex art Who are you to decide which subreddit is Good and which one is Wrong You are not God my friend God damn why the fuck would a decision like this be approved This place used to be uncensored and somewhere where freedom of speech was respected I can understand the banning of some of the subs in the past incels was a terrible subreddit that advocated violence but silencing dozens of subreddits on some bullshit charge of you guys not liking them Nice xB You want to protect the people from those subreddits They arent  year olds they can literally just not go to those subs xB You are only driving more people to visit those subreddits to see what the fuss is about and only giving them more exposure anyways xB xB What exactly do you look for to confirm a subreddit requires quarantine after it is reported Are there unspoken guidelines you follow at times in cases of technicalities Top down manipulation of content bc ppl need to be protected never worked in politics religion society Rip Reddit So reddit will become even more of an echo chamber Reddit lacks a meeting ground like rpolitics used to be The growth of TheDonald is partly because of the forceful ejection of nonneoliberals from the conversation in  Reddit needs better protections against botting and astroturfing and special interest groups  for example reinstating showing both upvotes and downvotes for comments This is just stopping people having a controversial opinion While the Holocaust was real people have the right to discuss whether it was or not this is just stopping freedom of speech In other words youre censoring political and moral opinions What else is new So in other words quarantining is a way for censorshiphappy snowflakes to plug their ears and cover their eyes Gotcha Super open and diverse platform youve got here deleted This is kind of bullshit You should either ban them or let them do whatever they want I know the Donald is the primary reason for this existing in the first place but I see far more anti trump posts than trump posts Whatever happened to letting people curate their own feeds or do you think that the average user is too stupid or gullible to do so Everything needs daddy to make sure no scary stuff or lies ever shows up It is so condescending Sounds like a shadow ban Censorship is censorship no matter how you dress it up Just admit what youre doing and tell people that this website no longer cares about free speech as a concept We all know it We just want you to be honest for once deleted deleted So basically the quarantine function hides subreddits with controversial or offensive subject matter from people who arent actively interested based on what criteria Your opinions Enough reports received Im all for quarantining for offensive content but you guys are crossing the line quarantining certain subreddits for purely ideological reasons and trying to force positive masculinity written by a man who was convicted of sexual harassment at his own University shame on all of you who run Reddit besides become nothing but a farleft sjw shill of its former glory Meanwhile TD has an entire thread calling for a sexual assault victim a whore Last year a study of  million reddit comments and subimissionshttpcompsocialgatechedupaperscscwchandhatepdf showed that banning hate communities work Heres what they found in short In  Reddit closed several subredditsforemost among them rfatpeoplehate and rCoonTowndue to violations of Reddits antiharassment policy However the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach remains unclear banning might diminish hateful behavior or it may relocate such behavior to different parts of the site We study the ban of rfatpeoplehate and rCoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and affected subreddits Working from over M Reddit posts and comments we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods We find that the ban worked for Reddit More accounts than expected discontinued using the site those that stayed drastically decreased their hate speech usageby at least  Though many subreddits saw an influx of rfatpeoplehate and rCoonTown migrants those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage In other words other subreddits did not inherit the problem  John Naughton is professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University earlier this year he wrote a clear opinion piecehttpswwwtheguardiancomcommentisfreemarextremismpayswhysiliconvalleynotshuttingitdownyoutube on how you reddit as a social media site profit off hosting extremism The tech giants need for engagement to keep revenues flowing means they are loath to stop driving viewers to evermore unsavoury content Youre dressing up shit instead of banning it even though you know banning hate works He writes Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin The latest hapless exhibit is YouTubes chief executive Susan Wojcicki who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform This will be achieved apparently by showing  alongside conspiracytheory videos for example  additional information cues including a text box linking to thirdparty sources about widely accepted events like the moon landing It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia Reddit isnt doing even that Reddit is guaranteeing echo chambers of junk content who in many cases actively ban dissent or dissenting voices In public reddits top staff are calling this valuable conversation worth having  In a speech earlier this septemberhttpspointsdatasocietynetmediamanipulationstrategicamplificationandresponsiblejournalismfdf Danah Boyd says very accutely Over the last  years the tech industry has held steadfast to its commitment to creating new pathways for people who historically have not had access to the tools of scaled communication Yet at this very moment those who built these tools and imagined letting a thousand flowers bloom are stepping back and wondering what hath we wrought Like the ACLU and other staunch free speech advocates we all recognized that we would need to accept a certain amount of ugly speech But never in their wildest imaginations did the creators of major social media realize that their tools of amplification would be weaponized to radicalize people towards extremism gaslight publics or serve as vehicles of cruel harassment   Reddit is quickly becoming the only major platform without rules against hate speech Reddit is becoming if it isnt already the platform where haters gather to hate unobstructed by mods who insulate their views against counterspeech and examination  Why is reddit not banning hate speech when it works  Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers Every developed country in the world has some form of law on the books against hate speech except the United States There are tonnes of legally practiced clear objective definitions with decades of jurisprudence to take from  Why isnt reddits policy team taking hate speech seriously  What are the  biggest reasons for quarantining rather than banning the shittiest communities you choose to host What are the  biggest reasons reddit view for banning hate communities rather than quarantining them What other options in between are you considering like banning removal of comments for dissenting with the circlejerk Quarantined communities dont get ads Theyre effectively subsidized by the rest of reddit all of reddit is paying to host its worst communities  Why does and should reddit sponsor hate Is there a way to petition to put a subreddit in quarantine Checked the obvious one and its not tagged Damn This site doesnt have much longer This is a stupid Idea and you know it Arare you telling me I cant rwatchpeopledie now This will not border on political censorship correct As you know other social media platforms have been under fire for censoring those with political affiliation Its one thing to silence a group for being a bunch of fools that intend to disrupt peoples lives and another thing entirely to censor someone as the result of some politicallybiased agenda even though they do blend together at times In any case I do hope you take some level of caution with this updated quarantine system regarding such topics Sadly reddit has been going downhill and deviating from its original form faster and faster these days There should be no banning or censorship of any subreddits unless illegal activities are being promoted or conducted We dont need a central authority to dictate what we get to see or not see thats for us the users to decide Im enjoying this site less and less exponentially its simply gotten too political and the echo chamber situation has been turned up to  with all these healthy website campaigns I sincerely hope that one day you will realize the true danger of censoring ideas with which you disagree This policy has made this platform even more of a joke than its already become It is truly sad that you all have destroyed what could have been a real asset to society Instead were now relegated to groupthink controlled by a few In a feeble attempt to fight against fascism you have created something which is now fascist in and of itself Great work Yup this is exactly what Aaron had in mind for Reddit Got it so every right leaning sub has been shut down This website is one big lefty circlejerk groupthink cesspool How is reddit open and diverse when you quarantine subs you dissagree with and ban ones you done like that arent illegal So why arent we able to see the number of subscribers a quarantined community has Sorry man Censorship isnt very tubular at all Reddit gets worse with censorship every day If the quarantine filter was optional I would believe that its purpose is to protect users The fact that its not means that its purpose is to censor users The admins could easily allow users to opt in to quarantined posts being displayed in search results This functionality is purposely left out in order to suppress information and make it much harder to find The number of politically neutral platforms is rapidly decreasing If you care about free speech its time to either migrate to new platforms or create them Vote with your dollars The removal of redpill is uncalled for unfair Dont ban them for their ideology and then link to an alternative source on how people should view masculinity Neither that source or the redpill are correct Its simply opinions Reddit inserting their own opinions and ideology is actually kind of disgusting and hypocriticali dont want reddit to curate and tell me what content is right for me according to their opinions xB this is downright internet censorship and a form of bullying the red pill had  members and helped allot of guys in a positive way to get control over their life xB suggestion reddit truly wants to do good heres a suggestion create a filter just like ones for nsfw or pornograpghy warning people about the content and not removing itishttpsitis its the peoples choice what content they consume not the choice of reddit because reddit this agrees with that particular ideology xB if reddit acts the way it does it should quarantine itself according to its own ideology because one limiting free speech and imposing their own ideology on others by removing the options reddit is going downhill Quarantine preventing site access on mobile or just not allowing people to visit Quarantine is choking to death any forum the powers that be disagree with and theyll work until reddit is the sterile echo chamber they want to see If you find something offensive dont subscribe Freedom of speechexpression is being killed by censorship and its sad to see what reddit has become xB You now only have the right to express ideas that coincide with popular opinion Disagree will lead to banishment xB Just waiting for this comment to be removed or banned Fuck reddits censorship bullshit Go fuck yourselves asshats At the risk of being flamed rblackcrime quarantined  banned  hours ago rsaltedcrime public untouched How is that okay edit Reported  days agohttpswwwredditcommessagemessagesdcqda to rredditcom edit  adding the mods other subs to the list and one other random one rbadwhitey  rwhiteycrime  rTrueWhiteCrime edit  rmayotown was just quarantined Who the fuck wrote the quarantine message on rFULLCOMMUNISM  Thats pure propaganda lol So im subscribed to rwatchpeopledie but cant access it Wtf Why was rTheRedPill quarantined Whatever your opinion on the content might be it was a well moderated sub that kept itself insular From my few years subscribed to the sub I saw ZERO evidence of brigading while rTheDonald has some sort of brigade every week Im not even saying rTheDonald should be quarantined The more freedom of speech the better But I dont get how that sub can frequently break the reddit terms of service and get off scot free while rTheRedPill gets quarantined The Red Pill helped me become a better man I was a young man who had just gone through a terrible breakup and the subreddit helped me pick myself up off of my feet then build myself both physically spiritually and mentally There arent many spaces online where men can talk amongst themselves about their issues I implore you to reconsider I genuinely believe the subreddit has saved lives Many young men come to the sub depressed with their lives and the red pill has supplies them with advice and the tools to change their lives i love how reddit equates holocaust denial and communism thats so good well done very smart great horseshoe theory love that Censorship trash I want to see it all if Im looking at all I want to see ALL Make rall all again I almost exclusively browse all Aaron Swartz would be rolling in his grave at the disgusting parody of an open platform for discourse that this site has become I will be here to make it as unpleasant and toxic as possible for the babies who actually think it should be like this and hopefully I will be here to see an announcement that reddit is shutting down What a load of censorshit How the fuck can you remove access to a sub Im already a subscribed member of Knowing damn well most users are on mobile and its a major deterrent to them going to enable on desktop Every fucking week we see additional subs banned quarantined This site has went to shit I hope someone is ready to step up and be the website Reddit couldve been Front page of the internet please by the time this censorship is done the only links leading to Reddit will be to post like this uspez  the mod that was banned has created another account as you can see here httpiimgurcomHbUKIpng So thats a site wide ban right Lets talk about Orlando rnews FTFY  Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events We are working to make this more timely evident and organized Is it just me or do live threads suck Theyre fine to hang out on after youve read news articles and other reddit threads to get yourself up to date But as a primary source of info theyre just too unfiltered and empty If you come to reddit  hours after an incident has started a normal reddit post will have a a link to a good article covering the scenario and if the primary link is insufficient or inaccurate the top comment is likely to be a better source b several top comments with context and discussion pretty representative about what reddit and a chunk of the world are thinking at the time c a fairly responsive bubbling up for new information along with a new sort option to check the latest While on the other hand a live thread will just be random and often inane comments lots of repetitive comments and zero attention on all the background info its assumed everybody already knows Lesson learned No longer count on reddit for news This sounds like a very long post to say that other than banning an obvious sockpuppet nothing is going to be done So business as usual then Edit Turns out they didnt even ban the account the user simply deleted the account So nothing was done We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims We investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong Ive noticed the last several major news stories have taken so long to reach the front page that I have gotten faster updates on Facebook and TMZ among other sites Reddit used to be lightning fast as a source for news but in recent months its become well kind of pathetic Can we expect this to change or has reddits usefulness along these lines come to an end I have to express disappointment with this statement You guys had more transparency over the whole Pao situation than you are showing here Your site the place I previously went for my news actively censored the worst terror attack in America since  And your response is well guys you did post a lot of duplicates and  guy was a little out of line No your site actively censored information You are literally lying to our faces I saw the posts and comments that were deleted many others did as well Its baffling how unimportant you feel this display of censorship was I do not accept the story that it was  lone mod where were the actual paid employees and admins during the whole situation The same way journalists come in on a sunday when a fucking national disaster occurs so should you all You didnt take your responsibility as a news source seriously and you have now done very real damage to your credibility as a source You were the front page of the internet Now you have not only actively censored the dissemination of news and information during a national crisis you have come back today and said we investigated ourselves and found no wrong doing we will use live threads more in the future Would you trust a news station again pretended  wasnt happening for half a day And then they come back the next day and say o yea  intern goofed dont worry we canned him all good Very disappointing Two things that are absolutely needed that you havent addressed  Its against the rules for a user to create an account to circumvent a moderators ban So why are moderators permitted to create a new account to moderate major subreddits after one of their moderator accounts disappears for one reason or another Also for defaults purging of inactive mods needs to be automatic and entirely dependent on activity in that subreddit Also forbid shared moderator accounts definitely against the rules already from doing anything except make stickies  The quality of Reddit is entirely dependent on the quality of its community  not the quality of algorithms Vote manipulation was not a notable problem at any time yesterday Rather the problem was that one or more moderators decided to stifle discussion from its ordinary community Since its a default the community is already everybody Brigading fundamentally cant happen on something everybody checks regularly and all the rest of the mods were perfectly happy to let it happen Or to put it shortly  previously it was possible for me to trust Reddit to inform me of any major news story it doesnt matter that updates arent perfect but that is no longer the case I didnt know about this at all until I heard about it from other media which is frankly embarrassing Is there an official response from the rnews mods Do we know what was removed and WHY or was it just everything What will you do about the user urnewsmod which is a shared account for the moderators which tried to spin yesterdays censorship to about not caring for yesterdays shooting urnewsmod Only comments breaking our rules are being deleted If you think its more productive to cry about censorship then it is to discuss this horrifying event we suggest you try another subreddit Why are there even shared mod accounts Dont you see how this could easily be abused by moderator teams so they never take responsibility for their own actions EDIT Proof of what urnewsmod wrote httpiimgurcomrqZfipng Also here is a example of how they treat their users httpiimgurcomnfjxsPqpng httptrmpusimagesrnewspng You titled this post Lets talk about Orlando when it really should be Lets talk about rnews People in rnews were trying to talk about Orlando and  comments were deleted  What percentage of those comments do the admins agree should have been removed  Care to share a bit more of the details of the admins investigation ETA uspez In your post you talk about how death threats are NOT OK I wouldnt disagree But then you hand wave a mod telling someone to kill themselves with Oh theyre gone now Lets talk about Orlando Rampart  Are users held to a higher standard than mods  A mod can tell someone to kill themselves whilst deleting posts about where you can give blood and we need to focus on how the mods got death threats  Has the offending mod been banned from reddit  Were they another mods alt  Will they be back in  months Edit uspez as ublownupp points out herehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsnykletstalkaboutorlandode these were ten comments that were deleted Given you state that A few posts were removed incorrectly which have now been restored ublownupp linked to ten comments  What does a few mean to reddit admins is it proportional  If it was  which is an understandable error rate if not even nearly Six Sigma then were  comments removed without cause  If so were those comments all removed by the one rogue mod who were supposed to blame for all this Edit uspez heres a quote of one of the few deleted posts My friend brian fitzgerald is currently missing atm I know he went out last night with a friend he met on grindr and his parents dont know where he is If anyone knows anything about the names of the people that were killed please I just want to know if hes ok Read that for a minute Let it sink in  Then please come back here and explain to us since you are admins and have all the data whether this comment was deleted by a moderator or by automod  If it was deleted by a moderator which one  Was it conveniently the one whos been put in timeout  If it wasnt how many more of these types of comments did your investigation uncover ETA IfWhen Reddit launches an IPO buy one share When the money from Conde Naste and venture capitalists run out and these people need to launch a publicly traded company so they can retire on reddit money dont buy gold that month Buy one share Youre guaranteed access to their shareholders meeting each year whether in person or on a conference call You can ask them questions Hi uspez I genuinely appreciate that youre taking the time to reach out to the community even though this comment is going to be critical of you and the rnews moderation team Since you mention that there was no censorship outside of nowrestored posts I assume that means you agree with the removal of comments that have not been reinstated I saved a couple from the megathread when practically everything was being deleted and Id like to hear your thoughts on why they break the rules of rnews Mods of rnews are welcome to chime in too  First the comment by uunrave that was reinstated Here is a mainstream British media news item about the incident The gunman is a yearold Omar Mateen an American citizen whose parents are from Afghanistan httpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsnqlforlandonightclubshootingmegathreaddak Im happy that it was reinstated but I cannot fathom how it was removed in the first place  Second a comment by uVitaleTegn that remains removed you can visit his user page to read the comment for yourself Moderators of rnews This is highly inappropriate and morally detestable At this point youre just deleting comments that dont suit your world view Your job is to allow discussion especially on a breaking news story like this and not pick and choose the comments you want to be seen Go ahead delete mine youll just be making my point stand truehttpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsnqlforlandonightclubshootingmegathreaddas I dont think this breaks any of the rules perhaps you could argue that its unnecessarily rude or provocative  Third a comment by uLunagray that remains removed again visit user page to verify Biggest shooting in US history not even front page What a jokehttpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsnqlforlandonightclubshootingmegathreaddrx Again its unclear what rule this breaks Many users were rightfully disappointed that discussion was hard to find  Finally one more comment that remains removed this one by uredconsensus While investigators are exploring all angles they have suggestions the individual has leanings towards Islamic terrorism but right now we cant say definitely said Ron Hopper assistant special agent in charge of the FBIs Orlando bureauhttpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsnqlforlandonightclubshootingmegathreaddavq While the user did not link to a source a Google search of this reveals mainstream sources like CNNhttpwebcachegoogleusercontentcomsearchqcacheBEKBoAwJmcnncomuspolicekilledinfloridanightclubterrorattackFfullarticleDtruecdhlenctclnkglus with basically this exact quote Which rule does this break For me uspez the main issue with what happened in rnews this weekend wasnt the censorship I mean it was an issue for sure But the main issue was the fact that the worst mass shooting in US history was not even on the front page for several hours because the mods chose to remove all posts about it WAY after the incident happened and replace it with a megathread The missing news story from the front page shouldnt have happened All discussion was already happening on the initial posts there was no need to remove posts that were already on the front page I know that you cant necessarily find proof of censorship but what doesnt need proof is the fact that this hate crime was removed from the front page for a megathread that would never make it to the front page The shooting was not visible to Redditors and it should have been So my suggestion for a policy I think megathreads shouldnt be created hours after the initial frontpage posts as an excuse to remove them Like if megathreads are being created I dont think front page posts about the same subject should be removed It takes away valuable discussion thats already happening This wont handle censorship but censorship can be subjective and as you see very controversial I feel like this policy is more objective and thus more easily followed without any complaints Its pretty bold to say that there is no evidence of censorship when community undeletion logs pretty clearly show mods removing posts which contain nothing except links to related stories or headlines ie FBI Orlando Gunman May Have Leanings Toward Radical Islamic Terrorism I watched completely appropriate posts and even entire subthreads disappear between page refreshes It was abundantly clear to me watching yesterday that there was an agenda at play to shape the narrative in the rnews threads The moderator agendas in certain subreddits have been a running joke for a while now but after that display yesterday I have zero confidence in the ability of the rnews moderation team to objectively moderate the sub Locking threads because theyre getting a lot of attention is a horrific way to manage such a scenario  saying we cant control this so were going to just shut it down is hard to read as anything except censorship Reddit has plenty of community tools to help curate discussion content and a bunch of people voting in a way that you dont agree with isnt necessarily brigading Regarding the rogue moderator name and shame and point out what they did why what they did was inappropriate and any internal policies the team has taken to prevent that from happening again Theres a moderation log  make it public so that when content is removed people can see when by whom and possibly why Maybe even consider something like HNs showdead flag to permit readers willing to brave the dregs of the comments to see things that have been removed so as to improve accountability and diminish the capacity for moderators to operate in secret You have pretty damning evidence that the current system allows for abuses that are withing your technical means to mitigate Shame on everyone involved in suppressing conversation that didnt support their biases yesterday I dont know if I like being told that what I witnessed on rnews yesterday didnt happen Because it did A subreddit full of people dedicated to immaturely cheerleading a political candidate was on the ball on disseminating breaking news while a sub specifically MEANT to do that and almost  times bigger was doing its best impression of MH and no where to be found There is only one moderator of that failure of a subs mod team actually addressing any concerns actively and most people are screaming out how little confidence they have in that mod team without being heard This whole mess needs a seriously bigger response than some announcement posts that youll do better because frankly anyone whos been on Reddit the last few years know how worthless that phrase has become BAN shared moderator accounts uRNewsMod NEEDS TO GO This was an example of a serious subject that brought attention to this issue but as a frequent Reddit user and a mod of my own small sub shameless plug for rradarloops I will say some subs have gone out of control with rules and over zealous moderators More and more I submit things to any handful of subs I subscribe to and usually feel about  on whether or not my post will be deleted for any number of reasons I do my best to read and follow posting rules but some subs have a far too long list of rules thread tagging procedures required title info etc Sure a few subs like rIAmA need concrete and detailed rules but these are the exception and not the rule Far too many subs have gone off the wire with rules and moderation to the point it affects my experience with Reddit I know mods are volunteers as I mentioned I mod but they still should be some checks and balances on their power and repercussions when they do poor work I also think Reddit as a company needs to structure subs in a way that dont require as much human judgement to help and shorten some of these crazy rule lists we have For example a sub template for a TV show with spoiler tags prebuilt in title templates built in a programmatic fashion time controls similar to reddit live threads for premiere episode threads etc This is just a single example for any number of sub reddit templates that could exist You guys should also work with moderators on moderating techniques and perhaps make a guide book to moderating Sure the sub I run has some rules but if someone screws up and its something I can fix I do it let them know what I did and why and educate them on how to do whatever properly in the future If it comes to me deleting a post I PM them and let them know why and perhaps suggest what could be done to correct the situation I dont blindly delete things or delete them and send the OP a short childish response or my favorite response the copy and paste of page  rule  subsection C amendment II Some mods take themselves way to seriously and have more of a confrontational mentatlity with the users than a guide like one Finally any large subreddits that absolutely require long lists rules should have a community staff member involved with them and not simply run by volunteers or pay and when required fire the mods on subs XX in size  We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims httpiimgurcommuqNmHgif Every post was locked deleted or a comment graveyard Its one thing to say that you dont want multiple copies of the same story when moderating but someone or something was clearly going nuts in the moment trying to keep the front of rnews free and clear from any stories of the shooting We needed an AskReddit thread for updates They shouldnt be forced to cover for another subreddits massive failings and people who arent subscribed to that subreddit shouldnt be forced to dig around to try and figure out why there arent any news stories on their homepage Not only that but rnews abandoning the story made rthedonald the goto place for coverage as it was the only subreddit that had a continuous stream of updates coming in so it started dominating rall If you are going to as a company promote a subreddit as the place for news by giving them default status they must demonstrate a certain level of competence during a gigantic news story If they cant Reddit admins must either take steps to ensure that they will be competent in the future or remove them as the default location for news stories One fall guy a couple of tweaks to stop bridgading which addresses the response to the whitewashing but not the actual whitewashing and some rall algorithm tweaks unless deleted posts are going to stay in rall that seems irrelevant also I tend to browse my homepage or the default homepage not rall you havent really done anything You havent even identified the problem No uspez  your site is the main source of news for millions of people Your editors can no longer continue to be sycophantic egocentric politically motivated children Reddit is calling for all of the mods to be removed from rnews You need to respond to or better yet take responsibility for the clear lack of oversight and responsibility standard that your main subreddits your content providers post Something about One moderator sounds kind of bullshit Youre telling me one moderator completely censored multiple threads at a very high rate Sounds like a lot of work for only one person Or are we talking about the one moderator sending death threats Because that doesnt solve the problem This is disgracefulBlame everyone but yourselves The mods who have been called out for months if not years had been confronted with a huge story and they do what we all expected If News is not purged you lost any respect some users may have had Your rNews mods are accused of censoring comments and news stories and trying to control the narrative The evidence is in fact overwhelming that this is what they were doing A little reminder about reddiquettehttpswwwredditcomwikireddiquette Please dontTake moderation positions in a community where your profession employment or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit The mods of rNews clearly broke reddiqutte You need to stop blowing smoke up our ass  rNewsModsmustResign Censorship has no place on a default news sub Boycott Reddit gold So a subs mods pull some shady crap yet again and the admins back them up and handwave it away as nothing If you continue to breed feelings of mistrust and disdain your user base will eventually get sick of it and leave For now you might feel secure thinking Where are they gonna go but you push people to the breaking point and it wont matter theyll go back to using google alerts theyll go back to using  different sites instead of  different subs Reddits convenience just wont justify the hassletoxicity  Lets talk about Orlando Thats what people were trying to do as the event was unfolding Reddit was completely useless as a platform during that time People were dying and Reddit was sanctioning the removal of people posting where to give blood The time for talk is over Its time for action now As a moderator of several of your default subreddits Ive seen my fair share of default meltdowns I instigated May May June with my wellintentioned but tonedeaf Stop Think Atheism spiel I watched GamerGate unfold in front of my team in rgaming while wellintentioned but poorlyconsidered actions turned what should have been a single deletion into something resembling a grand conspiracy Ive done my own fuckups and been on teams that have fucked up All of that pales in comparison to the shameful response from rnews and Reddit Incs subsequent complacency in their actions Hundreds of gay lesbian and bisexual Americans were gunned down in a blaze of hatred Half of those died including an eighteen year old high school graduate celebrating her success  The th victim of the Pulse Orlando mass shooting has been identified as Akyra Monet Murray   Murray who was from Philadelphia was in Orlando with her family celebrating her graduation from West Catholic Preparatory High School Her mother Natalie Murray she was on the phone with her wounded daughter as she cowered in a bathroom stall hiding from the shooter  Natalie Murray said Akyra sent a text message at  am on Sunday pleading for her parents to pick her up from the nightclub because there had been a shooting  Moments later Akyra called her mother screaming saying she was losing a lot of blood  The yearold was an honors student who graduated third in her class last week She was headed to Mercyhurst College in Erie on a full basketball scholarship Reddits reaction to this has been to enable and empower xenophobia by endorsing and embracing the wanton disregard for human life exuded by the moderators of rnews during this indescribable indefensible attack on the city that hosts the Happiest Place on Earth Because what Reddit did during this whole fiasco was a fuck ton of nothing and the result was people flocking to a quasisatirical hub of fascist demagoguery because it was the only place they could have the discussion  people are dead including that collegebound young woman whose mothers last memory of her daughter is hearing her agonized screams as she bled to death And you want to talk You want to make THIS the time you finally stand up for a moderator team If this is the line in the sand youre going to draw you might want to notice youre defending a landfill We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation AKA Were sick of thedonald being at the top  Whether you agree with rnews policies or not it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators Expressing your anger is fine Sending death threats is not We will be taking action against users moderators posts and communities that encourage such behavior This is the excuse every single time I hope people see through this and are sickened by it by now Its as silly as lecturing all Muslims for the shooters actions Ive seen plenty about this incident but have seen nothing about users pointing to the idea of harassing the rnews mods as being a solution Theres so much distrust for that excuse Im unfortunately inclined to think it might just be a front for removing the posts accounts and subs that have drawn attention to the coverup by rnews and than excusing it by saying they were harassing users Was rbannedfrommeirl encouraging harassment by their users that was never evidenced even though their subreddit rules and mods explicitly discouraged harassment The challenges in their rnews mods actions You mean covering up the largest mass shooting in American national history and stifling discussion by bias You mean one of the lead mods telling other users to kill themselves You mean the rnews mods accidentally posting on a community moderating alt calling someone a classic rTheDonald poster We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims Im sorry but people can use multiple sites to see the comments removed enough to see through that blatant lie Why dont you tackle the issue honestly What reason do you have to play phony PR boy who doesnt know whats happening and wont acknowledge it We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims That is some great double speak This whole post is Reddit as a company has a good thing going Users create submit freeboot and manage content for reddit for free In lieu of financial compensation the mods for almost every subreddit just want the ability to exercise their brand of petty tyranny because they are sad people with no perspective However reddit staff regularly communicates with the mods of large subreddits like rnews about the practices and policies and sometimes suggests an editorial viewpoint While some mods might not have been acting directly with reddit staff in these actions reddit staff has made themselves culpable with any actions by any of those mods because of that interaction So reddit needs to grow a fucking pair and own up to shit when shit hits the fan instead of trying to trick users in to believing another line of bullshit Sure a lot of people are going to buy it again But some wont Because you are only appealing to the lowest common denominator and that worked out so well for gawker Or maybe it is reddits goal to achieve BuzzFeed levels of credibility and respect So when a news event happens and a megathread is created initial commentsreactions get voted to the top Any new information and updates may or may not be edited into the main post and is usually just going to be a buried comment Every post at all related to the same news event is deleted In other words  minutes after something happens Reddit is literally the WORST place on the internet to get news The only thing in front of you will be a single post that the event is happening and best or top will be the most popular comments from the first  minutes and new will be ignorant reactions That doesnt seem like a good idea at all If there were a subreddit with moderators that knew the difference between contributing to the discussion and not and would just remove  of parent comments that dont contribute to the discussion that would be a good start  Edit To those saying livethreads fix the problem I agree they are an improvement but that still doesnt explain why new articlesstories with new information are automatically deleted just because a megathread or live thread exists How many hours after an event until new stories with new information are allowed as new content  hour  hours  hours Simply put if I wanted the most up to date information about this story and several others in the recent past newsgooglecom or any other actual news site was far easier to find what I was looking for than Reddit Reddit is just the best place to find out how the reddit or specific subreddit hivemind is reacting to a particular story Duplicate news stories muddy the water but removing all posts that have anything to do with a topic limits the amount of information that can be found about an event on this website Going to be brutally frank here Reddit dropped the ball on Sunday in a spectacular fashion I was driving from Georgia to DC on the road all day so I didnt have access to a television and all I had was my smart phone All I could see in rnews was deleted posts The whole reason I joined Reddit in the first place was so I could get news faster than the mainstream outlets Reddit has now failed completely at this purpose As a result I wont be using this site as a news outlet Ive deleted any news subreddits from my feed and am sticking to my special interestshobbies only Ill reconsider this in the future but for now Reddit is useless to me for relevant news information The sentiment put out by thisnpost is that the users are to blame for the absolute shit show in rnews yesterday when that could not be farther from the truth Comments pointing out that the assailant was affiliated with ISIS were deleted Comments detailing where to donate blood were deleted Comments pointing out information in regards to casualties were deleted All in the guise of preventing islamophobia How in the fuck is telling people where to donate blood creating Islamophobia How in the hell is that a violation of policy in even the subreddit Yet yall seem to be perfectly fine with mods telling users to kill yourself At least thats the sentiment Im getting The userbase by and large are not gonna be appeased by anything less than the removal of all moderators in that subreddit and you have to know that If there is a better solution Im sure you will find one but you need to understand that there is no reason for members of the Reddit community to find out about the worst terrorist attack in the US since  as much as  hours later Im posting a link to a screencap of a guy who tried  times to post about the need for blood donations but was deleted How is THAT bigoted httpiimgurcomOGaPNijpng This level of moderation did not occur during the Paris shootings Brussels airport shooting airline crashes etc Something more needs to be done here During the aftermath of the largest shooting in US history is not the time for heavy moderation and ban attacks from moderators We come to reddit for the flow of information Ive unsubbed from rnews and will replace it when something more suitable comes along Many people argue that the biggest issue with Reddit is that the moderators of default subreddits like rnews have too much power Is this concern on the radar of the admins at Reddit Is there any theory on how to handle this better than reactionary after the fact and on a case by case basis This seems like it will happen over and over the defaults are too important to be controlled by mods who tell redditors to kill themselves Edit See admins post herehttpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsnyyrenamingstickypoststoannouncements but they removedhttpsgithubcomallthefoxesredditcommitefadddddbdeccaa the requirement that for sticking a self that it had to be made by a mod  So what happens to regular sticky posts A few of my subreddits use sticky posts as a gathering of information Can only mods make sticky aka announcement posts What if a news info like E for the gaming subs a user makes a post first and we want to honor that by making a collective discussion thread Are we not able to do that and we as mods would have to create our own announcement post just to sticky it Examples when we would sticky a users post  They create a really detailed helpful post with information and we want to direct users to it  Mods are asleep and a user gets the drop on a game update or E coverage or some other bit of information We like to reduce redundant threads so direct discussion to a single thread and make this a stickied megathread  An important new story breaks out current event and the mods want to sticky that for visibility Users kinda get angry if mods remove threads to make their own especially when users get a big drop on the mods in terms of time Not exactly the best PR for us to remove a post and make our own just so we can sticky it to get users attention So what are we supposed to do Make a announcement thread with a link to the users thread and lock our thread just as a redirect  A few posts were removed incorrectly lol This is going to get totally buried but a few points  Sort this thread by top not qa which doesnt give an accurate image of the community response to this post  rnews has about  moderators Is it fair to scapegoat this whole debacle onto one rogue moderator It is clear either they were in agreement with the mass comment deletions or were simply not there in which case rnews clearly needs a better bigger moderating team  Having a sockpuppet moderating account should be against the rules as it prevents moderator action accountability to be investigated by admins It is also disingenuous to users to have default sub moderators hiding behind such an account  The response of both uspez and the rnews moderators has been clearly inadequate  There seems to be this general attitude among some mods that they are doing us a favour by moderating the subs for free This along with disdain for the users they deal with in their subs You know what Moderating a default is a privilege If it is too much unpleasant work for you give it up Someone else will step up to the job Heck Id wager I could do a better job moderating rnews on my own than the whole moderating team And you know why because Id take a hands off approach and focus on spam which brings me to my next point  Reddit is clearly at war with its userbase and with its own architecture The whole point of voting on content and comments is to automatically moderate content having a heavyhanded approach to moderating goes against this idea And this is what is happening more and more As Reddit Inc is frantically searching for ways to monetise their golden egg it needs to clean up itself in order to be attractive to sensitive investors It is the same problem chan had And guess what Unless Reddit cashes in soon it will be over because the userbase is getting sick of being at odd ends with the admins and mods People were getting banned and comments deleted for saying muslim it is clearly heavy with censorship Many people unsubbed including myself for this very reason and for the leaders of reddit to have not found this to be the case makes yall as bad as them Please put in a better system to report mods Whats Reddits policy on posting pictures of events like this as theyre unfolding uspez why has Reddit not put more effort into promoting rlive posts I find them much more useful than some megathread that is difficult to keep track of  Can you make it easier for mods to link to rlive threads  Could you create a method for merging two live threads if they are the same subject and the creators want to merge them Spez I have been a very heavy browser lurker on this site for four years I had to create an account just to post here I dont mean to sound too abrasive but your post reeks of bullshit corporate PR damage control where the author has no respect for the readers intellect The reason people were upset last year about the censorship regarding FPH was not because they agreed with them but because the same person who needs to silence opinions they disagree with when they are in the right will do so when they are wrong Lets be honest people like these mods arent capable of realizing that they CAN be wrong So as a fat guy who iswas indifferent to criticism that the mods were protecting  users from I have to at least admit that maybe you had to clean up certain areas of the website to make it a viable business that can be monetized or made attractive to advertisers But in a situation like yesterday your mod team crippled one of the most popular subs and subs like it are why users are here to begin with And for just one moment cut the damage control bullshit because its not doing the site any favors Do you think you will continue to have users lurkers or advertisers if you become known as a content aggregator that shuts down content during major events Who will want to use a site like that Will advertisers want to be associated with a web site that suppresses pleas for blood donations to help save lives I may not be a steady subscriber and this might be my first post but make no mistake there are many accounts and lurkersbrowsers that are questioning what use this place is as a news content aggregator if this can happen even once during a news story like this  I know Im going to make the conscious decision to use this site a lot less I dont expect things to change very much until many others do Censoring should happen only lightly and only where absolutely needed Other wise wtf is the point I can have uncensored conversation in the real world and I had to go elsewhere for news because the FRONT PAGE OF THE INTERNET  forgot what its role was and why users are by here at all Content aggregation with a community to discuss the content in the comments section When you shut both content and conversation down you are left with nothing for the users and nothing to monetize Pull your head out of your ass Edit unsubscribed from news even though I dont intend to do too much posting on this account because Id rather get my news from the Huffington fucking post This post was more about rnews and reddit than Orlando Hijacking the Orlando massacre to justify the incompetence of a moderation team is highly despicable Title should be lets talk about rnews We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims So besides the censorship there was no censorship You disciplined someone for telling people to kill themselves but no one else for censoring facts Just another reminder that agendas are everywhere We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are NOW RESTORED have not found evidence to support these claims Fucking what This is like saying we heard the vase was broken but after gluing it back together we determined it wasnt broken Get real Moderators can make or break this website Certain ones overstep their boundary and yesterday was a prime example What an absolute garbage nonexplanation nonapology Also what a catastrophe of damage control So you contrary to overwhelming evidence and first hand accounts of thousands on this site found that no censorship occurred A few posts were removed incorrectly One moderator is to blam But also oh the poor mods are the victims here Spez your rnews mods have lost all credibility and you need to clean house You are now losing all credibility yourself by making bullshit excuses for them and protecting them Dont do it Its time to finally own up to what happened and is happening to a oncegood website apologize and take drastic action to correct things Do you think there is any chance at all this would have happened on  reddit  reddit  reddit This place is going to end up like digg if you dont make changes People are already searching for alternatives within the site and to the site as a whole The writing is on the wall and you keep digging yourself a deeper hole uspez I know Im late to the party here but I think what happened in rnews is that the moderators do not represent the community Instead they impose their own rules whether listed or not on a community that doesnt want those rules Im not trying to call those rules good or bad Im just stating this is what seems to be the case Further it feels like the community really has no input on how a subreddit should be run On a subreddit as big as rnews or any of the defaults there is no good mechanism to ensure the voice of the community is heard I think the best remedy should be allow the community to vote for moderators at least on the default subreddits I think that is the only good option that would both keep the community in check but also give the community a very big voice in how the subreddit should be run This is all nice but none of it addresses the real issue which is abuse among the mod teams here I dont have any solutions but there should be a checks and balance system put into place on some level to protest actions of a specific moderator For example if one or more mods are censoring discussion can we not raise those concerns somewhere higher than that specific subs modmail Because as shown over the weekend they will not treat those concerns in a serious or fair manner If you dont do anything to address this issue then you cant say that you are really doing anything to prevent what happened with Orlando again What a fucking cop out Have some guts and admit what really happened  Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place and removing speculative posts until facts are established A few posts were removed incorrectly which have now been restored UPDATE This thread is being manipulated by MORE deleted comments by mods httpiimgurcomZGrPLYLpng Only a few This is not true Its more than half the thread httpiimgurcomaYvRpng I used the Uneddit utility Google Uneddit Use it and come to this thread This is just one fraction of the entire page as you can see by the scrollbar There doesnt seem to be a reason when you compare some comments A lot of genuine comments were deleted and valid information is still not there The deleted comments are in red These are still gone We can go through every comment if youd like and compare it to this statement made here for transparency This is great httpimgurcomoPfrfPz Hello uspez you stated that a few posts were removed incorrectly however this is not the case Thousands of comments were removed for no reason they did not violate any rules and asked for fellow redditors to donate blood to local centers etc we ask you to be transparent in your public statement and not give us some nonsense which is obviously false and you are in full damage control Furthermore several mods on rnews lied about the mod in question and stated that this individual was not an alt account and later the mod in question revealed the removed mods official account We the community are appalled to how your response and the moderation team has handled the situation and are asking the whole moderation team to be replaced This was not an isolated incident with only one moderator instead the whole moderation team failed the community EDIT I meant comments my apologies which can be readily viewed on the rnews posts and comments such as the following one httpiimgurcomOGaPNijpng deleted given what happened in rnews is reddit finally considering some sort of code of conduct or litmus test for rightful ownership of prime real estate subreddit names besides I was there first I understand reddits policy on first come first serve made sense in the past and I also understand it allows you to stay out of the very sticky business of deeming someone unworthy of a sub or whatever but the whole just create another sub and build that community thing doesnt really hold water when it comes to subreddit discovery People check if common name exists they dont just stumble across ralternatenewssubthatisbettermanaged on their own unless people are spamming it  promoting it elsewhere etc The current system probably should be reviewed no Since this is a gigantic clusterfuck and no one will accept any responsibility for the default news subreddit having no threads about the one of the biggest news stories of the year I would like to take this moment to applaud the mods of raskreddit for really stepping up to the plate on this one good on ya boys deleted   This comment has been overwritten by this open source scripthttpsgreasyforkorgenscriptsredditoverwrite to protect this useraposs privacy The purpose of this

blackout on the largest islamicterrorist massshooting in American history then turn blame back on Reddits userbase Also our talk will include exactly  replies by myself in a thread with over  comments several which have over  upvotes and have been gilded Nice talking to ya  Spez This is just really bad PR speak in general You somehow managed to mitigate the damage rnews did to Reddit as a whole deleting posts with blood donation information really forcing us to go to rTheDonald and rAskReddit for breaking news are you serious somehow shift blame to phantom death threats against the moderation team and introduce technology changes that sound more like you want rTheDonald off of rall than you actually want to do something about the problem at present rnews as a whole yesterday was and continues to be a shithole because mods actively censored discussion once the information that Omar Mateen was a radical muslim Full stop If you as admins could look into what happened yesterday and not see what thousands of people not subscribed to rnews and the  people who have unsubscribed since yesterday can see then I just dont know what to say Maybe get a new pair of glasses that arent covered in corporate splooge and the sweaty desperation of trying to make the mainstream media believe that your rnews sub isnt complete and utter trash Oh and even titling this Lets talk about Orlando when the obvious problem at hand is your rnews default is despicable Fuck you for doing that  Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place and removing speculative posts until facts are established They deleted and banned a lot more than this and rnews was not the only offending subreddit rWorldnews banned the story as a local news story rnews banned posts about blood donations and anything that mentioned that the killer was Muslim This is something that has never been done when the killer is White It already sounds like youre dodging blame by saying that this is just their policy at rnews The whole issue is that a default subreddit like rnews which controls such a huge portion of traffic at reddit is able to censor delete insult promote overmoderate undermoderate or ban without any oversight or action Is rnews going to change their policies  its great that youre talking to them and trying to understand but what about the thousands of users who want something new Do we all go to a new sub cut our losses and accept that the promoted default subs have no effective check Do we have to make a new sub every time a subreddit displeases us Why should rnews remain the legitimate news subreddit Are you listening to the concerns of rnews subscribers or just the mods Without rushing to judgement it sounds like you really dont have anything new to say Edit People are pointing out that rWorldnews doesnt allow US stories and they try to steer users toward rnews Fair enough  I like rWorldnews I wonder if that makes it a worse problem rWorldnews gives rnews a wide berth which makes rnews even more of a chokepoint If default subreddits defer to other defaults that makes each default even more important in its own niche Confidence over caution that you say is preached at Reddit sounds like arrogance masquerading as purpose Proverbs suggest The wise are cautious and avoid danger fools plunge ahead with reckless confidence In your interview herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuSVqoWrzw you claim that users can find information and connections here that cannot be found anywhere else online This episode surely does not support that opinion Nor does your response You claim that you are the brains of the operation versus the charismatic leader Your post supports that you are not charisma the brains part we will have to see depending on your actions Something I have noticed consistent with many in leadership roles mocking their customers or in your case user base is summed up when you share that circlejerk provides you best insight into what is happening online at this time If that is true and you also think people take things too seriously as you state perhaps you are not the correct person to really comment or recommend action in this case I do find it interesting that you devote so much satisfaction to the demise of Digg selling out their users with sponsored content I find the actions you are taking to be similar to the accusations Mods are the weak link in the Reddit chain and allowing things to go as you seem to be doing here with mods of default subs having an agenda is really no different to selling out your users to those with an unknown end Isnt advertising communication with an agenda a form of manipulation So how is stifling free exchange of ideas and communication any different You go on to say you realize that Diggs demise was a lesson on how fast things in social media can die but you seem to be in denial as you careen this site off a cliff Maybe not now but the actions or lack of action seem to indicate the end will be sudden and obvious in retrospect If i were to offer anything as to what has been said about your qualities and strengths and what is seen in the interview it is obvious to me you are the wrong person to be leading the charge on this You are too convinced people are making too much of what was experienced Sunday But it is a fundamental shift from what I have seen in the past It is contrary to what I prefer Most including myself our more than capable of filtering out the noise hate off topic and so on and find the meat that is worth eating You say your self at the end of the interview Reddit has the best users and the best content on the internet Prove it edit just quickly this isnt a comment intended to be a jab at you uspez Im just still pretty pissed at the situation as the ramifications of such a situation could be huge  There was already one person who said that they first heard of the event on the news in their car on the way to work after they had already checked Reddit Imagine if that had been a relative of a victim and they had yet to know  I have to also admit Im a little sick of the blatant mod abuse too The agenda driven shit that Ive seen and been a blatant target of in posts Ive made and having been on Reddit for almost  years this place used to be a wonderful place for insightful and intelligent debate not agenda pushing tripe by entire mod teams  So uspez what I got from your post is that  A few posts were removed incorrectly  One moderator did cross the line with their behavior and is no longer a part of the team They did nothing wrong but one moderator was an asshole and is no longer on the team he deleted his own account with no punishment  Lets be serious that account was clearly an alt and the mod team runs on cronyism something that pisses me off the most with mod teams in general Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events We are working to make this more timely evident and organized Were going to try to focus on ensuring that Reddit Live is integrated more thoroughly  A system which is when created fully dictated by a small number of submitters with no means of stopping clear agenda pushing I couldnt possibly see how that could be used for nefarious purposes Were introducing a change to Sticky Posts Theyll now be called Announcement Posts which better captures their intended purpose they will only be able to be created by moderators and they must be text posts Votes will continue to count We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior Define preventing bad behaviour in what way are stickies used to encourage bad behaviour The mods at rpics posted one to ensure there was a place for people to discuss the events The mods of raskreddit did the same  The mods at rnews after they had finally got their act together decided to set one up as a sort of oopsie hurr hurr guys stop brigading us plebs post with a hollow apology but where was the undesirable behaviour We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation This to me looks like a blatant poke at rTheDonald a sub which I had little interest in prior to this fiasco as I dont live in the US and dont give much of a shit about your overall politics  Youre mad that rTheDonald became pretty much the only place where people found a open forum to discuss the tragedy and now youre punishing them for it by declaring what they did vote manipulation Fuck me spez you arent that dishonest I dont care if they dont align with your political views at least they had the balls to offer people a place to discuss things while rnews were busy running around a burning house We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities Something you guys repeat every time something like this happens I cant wait for the next time it happens and you say it yet again Have you considered you know focusing on the people you hire and not the number you hire A few posts were removed incorrectly That is Bagdad Bob level of misstating fact Dozens of posts were being deleted in real time and the reasoning for doing so was pretty ridiculous given reddits attempt to brand itself as an impartial and open news source  We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims If you dont call thousands of comments being deleted because a moderation team doesnt like them censorship what do you call it Oh thats right you call anything you dont like brigading Because its not possible to read and comment in multiple subreddits youre only allowed to have and share opinions in your own home turf Reddit of  Noncirclejerk opinions arent allowed in any subreddit Expressing a contrary view is brigading Theres no such thing as censorship the mods are always right and remember weve always been at war with Eastasia Edit Since Im getting a bit of traction this is the real problem as I see it  A sub like rnews normally has a consensus that A is right and B is wrong spoiler alert the mods usually also agree with A and disparage people who believe in B  A big thread appears and people who wouldnt normally comment or vote show up This is normal You might normally lurk in most subs but when something big happens you want to participate Its not brigading  Some comments in support of B start popping up and gasp they get upvoted This angers the mods  This is the part where the mods start deleting shit like crazy because opinions they dont like are actually prevailing The public discourse is shifting towards an unacceptable direction So they exercise editorial control over public opinion What gives them this right  Reddit users rebel and get super pissed off  Admins dont admit that the mods did anything wrong they victimblame people who had their comments or posts deleted and instead divert attention from the manipulation of discussion using brigading death threats and harassment as a scapegoat and boogeyman Weve been seeing this time and time again If  of users are brigading or harassing or doxxing or deaththreating because they believe in B then Reddit admins and mods decide its OK to delete all comments that express support of B If the mods do something shady and get called out by the community then immediately they and the admins go find some occurrences of the outgroup sending harassing messages newsflash its gonna happen in a site with hundreds of millions of active users and try to entirely change the subject to talk about that and sweep everything else under the rug As these things keep happening citizens of the internet are learning that Reddit isnt a forum for open and earnest discussion of ideas its a place where you can only say whats acceptable to mods and admins This isnt about harassment or hate speech or doxxing or brigading its about moderation teams shutting down opinions they dont agree with Moderators are not meant to shape public thought or push their values onto others Better to have no mods than mods who remove things they disagree with How can you say there was no censorship Every thread until the one in raskreddit made front page was deleted and several users reported being muted by the mods for asking why they were deleting post I saw one thread when I first got on in the morning and within an hour it was locked Within another hour it was deleted There was another one within a couple of hours which was also deleted Finally a post from rthedonald and raskreddit made it to front page and rnews finally decided to create a megathread and quit deleting the threads Then they followed up by deleting blood bank info which might have been done by a bot but if so then there needs to be a better review process put in place for those deleted post Regardless the mods of rnews should be removed and new team put in place I understand when it is a default sub there is going to be a lot to moderate but if they couldnt handle it or simply didnt want to then more mods need to be brought on Saying you will work closer isnt going to change anything because in reality we know nothing is going to change and it is just a way to make people happy If you think rnews is the only sub censoring content youre dead wrong Remember how rworldnews censored what was going on in Cologne during New Years Certain subreddits defaults especially have an obligation to try and be neutral or at the very least avoid censorship Lets be honest you cant have a fair political discussion on rpolitics Let the upvote system do its job Otherwise remove upvoting and downvoting and admit this site has control of what content people see Admins we dont need you manipulating content Let the users speak Not every body agrees with your politics maybe you need to self reflect Honestly its time to abandon Reddit as a platform uspez has no interest in providing a place for open dialogue Leftists demand an enclosed bubble without challenges to their assertions Dont buy gold Dont buy an IPO Use adblocker Switch to other social media platforms Reddit is a lost cause the defaults need a look at  A few posts were removed incorrectly Isnt this the understatement of the century The amount of DELETED comments in those threads was insane and it turned out many of them didnt come close to violating any policy Identifying where to go to donate blood We have investigated Will this be a transparent investigation or is this all you guys have to say on the matter it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators While I agree with the sentiment its really bad form IMO to include this here in this post Part of the disdain for how this was handled included the rnews mods blaming the users for their behavior This is a responsibility we take seriously This is hard to take seriously if theres a no accountability b no transparency and c no acknowledgement of how HORRIBLY this whole incident was handled This post effectively comes down to One mod crossed the line And by the way dont harass mods ever WeReddit Inc moderators and usersall have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available What happens when you  Reddit Inc and moderators Id argue that regular users do not have a duty to provide access to info  fail in this duty If its a serious responsibility as you claim are there repercussions or is there any accountability at all when the system fails edit theirthere correction You are seriously telling us you found no instances of censorship in the whole rnews fiasco I call bullshit We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation Just so rthedonald doesnt keep reaching rall all the time A few posts were removed incorrectly which have now been restored One moderator did cross the line with their behavior and is no longer a part of the team We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims In other words outright lies are completely acceptable if they fall in line with the political agenda of those on staff at reddithttpsarchiveisTLERg  seconds after the first reputable news source stated that the shooter was possibly of middle eastern descent  the entire mainstream sections of this web site were in full on Orwellian memory hole mode We have investigated ourselves and found ourselves not guilty Way to go Spez but honestly nobody could have expected more from you In such situations their community is flooded with all manners of posts Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place Look dupe posts on breaking stories is an issue thats been around on web news aggregators since the days of Slashdot and its not going away If you allow separate posts for every news link its inevitable that youll get lots of submissions for breaking major news and if the only tools mods have is post removal youre going to end up with a lot of censorship Sites like Google News have shown that the good way to deal with that is to allow the clustering of stories so that you see multiple posts of the same topic clustered together and the less popular ones hidden so that if you want to see more on the same topic you expand the topic This allows you to keep diversity of topics on the main page and have multiple sources for indepth coverage The other way is the Wikipedia current events way where each breaking topic gets one big page with links to different sources embedded within the post This will probably not work as well for Reddit because one of the problems is that the discussions stop being easily navigable after reaching  and the recent shooting news had posts with  posts If reddit wants to remain useful as a news source theyre going to have to learn to hide stories on the same topic with one main story per topic and a show more stories on this topic button or maybe a would you like to know more link uspez Ive been here a while moderated a few crisis situations seen reddit at its best and worst Watched as admins actually working with mods that had bad raps VA anyone to align them with a more inclusive way of moderating Saw admins right in the thick of commenting and moderating in some big events Norway shooting comes to mind Now you know when I see admin anywhere on Reddit In times like this days after the userbase is calling foul This isnt a public school board situations happen in real time why the delay to hear from head office You and the rest of the admins are the mods of mods letting a situation get way out of hand splintering subs and alienating users while your team watches the cards fall isnt necessary You cant say that nobody on the admin team saw the censorship spree in Orlando threads any one of them could have directed rnews mods or calmed down the herd asking for heads to roll Every time power mods piss off a large subreddit and we get the eventual admin hand cleaning post im in one part surprised admin still has accounts but also not surprised that you or whomever is doing an admin post will at best reply like a politician to a dozen comments then bail Yeah great PR attempt There is no excuse for the extremely unprofessional behavior of the mods over at rnews It doesnt matter if it was only one mod a few of them or all of them They represent the sub as a whole and should respect it as such Reddit altogether has gone down a neverending rabbit hole and will only continue to get worse Such a disgrace Do not tell us users what we need to keep in perspective I believe that most of us are aware of what matters most here That doesnt give you an excuse to apologize for the lack of effort given by the rnews mods The time when we needed information the most our voices and opinions were stripped away from us I am very sad about the events that happened in Orlando yesterday and it makes me sick to see mods pulling out their nonexistent internet cocks to prohibit people from getting the information they want to see So even though you all literally just saw yesterday how biased and corrupt we are we will be changing the algorithm so that now you see what we want you to see and not whats being upvoted Trust us we wont fuck you over like every other time Are the people running this site legitimately retarded Are you not getting the message We want you to not keep interfering with everything you are doing the exact opposite of that The algorithm is fine its the idiots running this site that need to be changed The main issue I see with this post disregarding the others is that its titled Lets talk about Orlando instead of literally anything else Lets talk about rnews Lets talk about Reddits response to the recent tragedy Lets talk about the moderators response to the recent tragedy Lets talk about changes to moderation Lets talk about the state of mods You spent once paragraph talking about how people died One fucking paragraph about how some lunatic murdered people and the other  paragraphs talking about rnews This post is not talking about Orlando its talking about the response of moderators in a specific subreddit Start by titling your announcement posts honestly instead of hiding behind literal corpses After you do that then a conversation between Reddit and its community about what needs to happen can start rnews should be about posting news stories from legitimate sources As a mostly lurker of Reddit I dont necessarily give comments much credence unless they are directly related to the story I am intelligent enough to ignore a handful of hatred and reciprocal violence or speculation Usually I am privileged to be a source of information ahead of others This tragedy and censorship of rnews forced me to go to another sub that I think of as a joke to get information Out of one side of your mouth you say no censorship  Then on the other you say you are limiting the ability to sticky posts and are changing the algorithm for more diversity You must think extremely low of us if you think we dont see this No admins should be mods so to prevent favoritism and bias We need the freedom to post vote on and disagree with whatever we like We are not here for your political agenda Remove rnews from default subs rnews should not be a default sub deleted I appreciate you addressing the issue but I feel this is a hollow attempt at damage control rather than a sincere attempt to make Reddit a better place What happened on Reddit was unacceptable but youre still placing some of the blame on the users It doesnt feel like the mods in question are getting more than a slight slap on the wrist And thats not fair to the community You know the people who make Reddit a success Im sorry if this means I cant mod anymore Its a small game community for a card game that is all buy dying Theyre good people and pretty much mod themselves anyway What a poor response  You didnt find censorship when entire threads were obvious comment graveyards When there are dozens of screenshots floating around documenting it  Youre using this event and rnews censorship to change the rall algorhithm How is that even relevant to this  Youre changing sticky posts Why What does this have to do with Orlando or rnews mods deleting hundreds of comments and threads This is obviously a hamfisted attempt to use a tragedy as an excuse to change the rules surrounding what appears on rall nothing else You should be ashamed for even posting this in this manner This thread will go well You say this is because of Orlando but looking at the policies its pretty clear youre trying to implement policies to torpedo TheDonald under the guise of Orlando I posted this on the rnews mod spin control thread yesterday will repost below I used to come to Reddit as soon as there was any breaking news  people from all over the world would link relevant articles or upload photos and videos in real time or provide different opinions in a way the mainstream media would not This was once the website on which I saw the Egyptian square protests unfold the protests in the Syrian maidan streamed live and many other global events unfold through the eyes of other users  the common man instead of through the eyes of spin doctor approved media narratives The more reddit has grown the more it has tended to cater to preestablished narratives in line with the mainstream media In order to attract popular users celebrities and clicks from the normal majority of people the entire site has sacrificed what made it a great website in the first place and whored out its soul It is not just rnews but nearly every other big subreddit as well Nothing you people can say is going to smooth over the fact that you suppressed discussion about one of the biggest terrorist attacks in the US to push your narrative There might have been an influx of users as with any other controversial news what you call brigading but there was no doxxing or misconduct in any thread You people shut down discussion as soon as the news dropped that the terrorist was muslim The damage is done Moderators leaving isnt going to fix the systematic rot in this website Perhaps making rnews non default may improve things but the site as a whole is beyond redemption The admins have learned nothing from Digg Since there is a lack of competition your userbase is going to hang out here but be warned that there will be an exodus to the first viable alternative at the earliest possible opportunity For  years Ive relied on reddit for my news This is the one place I can get all the news not just the stuff other media outlets choose to show me I saw the news about Orlando at the bottom of a New York Times article I was reading from a link on my front page I couldnt understand how I missed this on the front page I went back and it wasnt there What happened is absolute bullshit For the most part redditors police themselves Comments are upvoted and downvoted and the cream usually rises to the top In a high volume sub like rnews it always will At best all the moderators need to do is some fine tweaking there is no reason for heavy handed tactics because this is what results deleted uspez Why cant you simply come out and admit that Reddit and a good portion of mods have a certain bias and agenda that this is NOT an unbiaseduncensored news site and let the users decide We accept that Fox News is conservative MSNBC is liberal and CNN is a schizophrenic meth addict And thats OK because we know the context We know what were getting when we read Daily Kos or Newsmax  on either side Lets just call it what it is and say that Reddit and its leadership is attuned to a certain crowd that is hypersensitive to racegender politics and prefers to reject what they may perceive as overentitled mainstream American demographics and be honest with each other What happened in rnews yesterday was not an accident and the quicker you guys admit that the more people will just be OK with what Reddit is and know how large a grain of salt to take with any news events You can pretend the kill yourself mod was an errant outlier but those of us who have been on Reddit more than a few months know that just is not true This has to be the worst Mea Culpa Ive ever witnessed we investigated The entire user base can see it with our own eyes This wasnt a question of if censorship occurred This is was a question of to what extent This is the second non apology for blatant censorship Are the admins really going to do nothing You got foreign press accusing you of blatant censorship this is isnt faux Internet rage This was tangible blatant and frankly disgusting Edit This feels a lot like a Friday afternoon whitehouse dump on controversial topics You wanted for a Monday evening to address it Id imagine this is your slowest hour of waking EST time Steve I was working online professionally before you were born and at one point I ran a major news portal so Ive seen my share of bad things I know these past  hours have been tough on you and your staff and I dont envy you But with over  million uniques on your site a few subs have to become very professional with News being front  center Im talking true professional journalism and it has to be staffed  made easier with a global staff This hit on a Sunday where the sub had a skeleton crew that shouldve immediately ramped up to full war room with maximum staff Im not saying something Ive not done before I also believe that News should be one place where the Mods cant hide behind usernames It sounds so unredditlike but I believe they should all go by their real name While you dont report the news in a traditional fashion important things do appear here from experts in the field And when something hits youre right up there with CNN on importance and theres no such thing as this is skoobydoo reporting in the news business News is dead serious And as others have said this thread should be Lets talk about rnews because thats your problem you need to fix not Orlando Whether you agree with rnews policies or not it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators Expressing your anger is fine Sending death threats is not We will be taking action against users moderators posts and communities that encourage such behavior Just outright say you support censorship and lies to fit your narrative I have no doubt that not a single mod or user that is on your side will have a single thing done to them Your newly instated rules do nothing but empower yourself and other subreddit mods more censorship such that the truth is even more difficult to be brought to light Removing rnews from default would be the absolute minimum necessary to imply any good will towards open discussion on this website But of course that will not happen as that is not your intention Tell the lawyers and PR reps who crafted this message to go fuck themselves then find a mirror and tell yourself We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims This above all is god damn embarrassing and insulting Kill yourself Why not invest some time into developing a merged post feature So many of these situations are the result of content that is either hidden moved or deleted which instigates the suspicion that content is being censored If what youre saying is true and content was moderated because it violated duplicate content policies this would be a viable solution Moderators could select a target to merge posts into and the new post could even retain its updown votes but would appear as a list of related posts underneath the main text of the post before the comments Comments could easily be merged between the subsequent posts Or it could appear as a separate tab similar to the related discussions tab at the top of the post This would fix issues related to moderating duplicate content by keeping the moderation process visible to the user content isnt just hidden or missing while still giving moderators tools to keep their sub well organized without losing context or credibility It would be even better if there was a field either text or select that would give a reason for the moderation action Its hard to claim censorship when the content is still available and the reason its no longer on the stream of that sub is because it violates duplicate content policies On the other hand some content is so important that policy should take a backseat Whats more important making people aware of a massive shooting catastrophic environmental disaster public health risk etc or following a policy about duplicating content Common sense must always prevail over adherence to policy Policy is meant to support the process not strangle and restrict it by giving people control that they will inevitably abuse Last but not least  We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed This is a very roundabout way of saying youre going to make is so that what happened with rTheDonald isnt possible which bothers me If something is important enough for there to be a sizeable and legitimate effort to bring awareness to it  taking actions to prevent that from happening seems counter intuitive if what youre trying to do is support the users instead of control the content that they see That kind of baked in behavior is exactly what creates situations like what happened with rnews If you really think there was no censorship you need to understand one thing There were tons of reddit users I was one of them who had no clue that the event even happened while actively browsing reddit while it happened There was censorship even if it wasnt permanent It simply didnt get covered and you were completely left in the dark I always thought I could rely on reddit to be up to date on any major news because I will undoubtly see it pop up on the front page of rall within minutes of it happening But this time it was the polar opposite Its not acceptable for a site like this Apart from that  of the posts in the thread that was allowed to exist were removed You cant tell me that that isnt active censorship Because there was absolutely no reason or legitimacy to remove the vast majority of those posts You guys said you know our darkest secrets We dont even get news in time anymore This site quality is dropping so low I cant even It seems like Reddits only consistently adhered to policy is find one scapegoat and blame everything on them while singing My shit doesnt stink The story broke on rnews as is common In such situations their community is flooded with all manners of posts Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place and removing speculative posts until facts are established A few posts were removed incorrectly which have now been restored They were removed to the point that the sub had no mention of the shootings  and as such led to many not finding about the shootings until late I rely on Reddit for major news I dont go to CNN  I go to Reddit After yesterday I am left wondering how many other stories I received too late So it was fine when SandersForPresident was literally everywhere on the rAll page No issues there but then posts from a different Sub started showing up highand suddenly its time to change the rules Wow how progressive and open minded of you  This explanation is such a joke Its just cover for changing the rules after they stopped working for you Pathetic We have investigated ourselves and found ourselves innocent Reddit Mods Im not supporting harassing moderators but when moderators harass and censor users and admins dont step in in time what are we to do Reddit is supposed to be community driven That doesnt mean admins should let moderators act however they wish it means admins need to step in if the community demands it Youre definitely full of shit Stop using amateur inexperienced volunteers to moderate and curate your main subreddits with  million users and actually pay someone that knows something about journalism to moderate your news subreddit someone that knows something about politics to moderate your political subreddit etc You get what you pay for and you mostly get drama loving power trippers deleted What a sadly obvious attempt to just kick one mod account out and hope that all of this will go away The behavior of the entire news mod team has shaken the faith that people have in your website and these politically scripted half answers talking no real responsibility for your actions is only making it worse for you No instances of censorship The deleted post logs make it clearly obvious that there was clear political motivation behind the scrubbing of some of the comments the started the shitstorm How patronizing Is the mod actually gone or just that one account By working closely you mean youre removing their default status and canning the entire moderator team right Because as Im sure you know they basically worked together to warp the narrative of a fucking NEWS STORY the biggest mass shooting in your nations history by an agent of a current terrorist group removed posts that were telling people how and where to donate blood to help claiming it was hate speech Oh yeah and that one mod was telling people to kill themselves If you dont perform the previously mentioned actions then youre basically saying youre OK with all of what they did  and remember the story of what they did has already reached several news outlets itself so people ARE watching This is a responsibility we take seriously Your site didnt have the most important news event of the decade Your mods actively suppressed it That ANY of that moderation team is still in place makes it seem like might not take it seriously enough Those mods so effectively suppressed the story that they became the story I dont mean to be so inflammatory and thank you for this post but Reddit honestly cant be trusted to bring NEWS now Reddit worked a long time to become the place to get information Yahoo might rip off content for fluff but it was better than Reddit for actual news yesterday How you let that subs mods continue moderating on your site shows the direction the site is taking At best everything about your proposed changes comes across as ineffective At worst you create the impression of introducing unpopular changes using a convenient but ultimately irrelevant excuse We are working to make this more timely evident and organized Which tells me absolutely nothing about the actual action you intend to take and sounds very much like it could be a coded statement covering any number of changes that would make the situation worse eg giving moderators the responsibility for managing live threads that are determined to be related to some particular major subreddit Like say rnews  which by that thinking would be responsible for almost all of them Or maybe it means letting the admins start them Pardon if that doesnt actually inspire the trust that youd like it to Were introducing a change to Sticky Posts Theyll now be called Announcement Posts which better captures their intended purpose So a cosmetic change that affects nothing and is inaccurate for many subreddits  including for example rlearnpython where I moderate and we use it to maintain a weekly general QA thread they will only be able to be created by moderators No actual change since checking the thread there you removed the thread authorship requirement and they must be text posts And a change that limits what mods can do with the feature for no better reason than because of what most people were using it for We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior Absurd It will accomplish nothing of the sort Supposing I take you at your word that this is necessary theres no reason that a text post couldnt be used to organize bad behaviour in a malicious subreddit Edit reading through the rchangelog thread it seems that basically nobody thinks any of your proposed changes to stickies are any good So yeah We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation Why even have rall if you want to curate what shows up You already curate by your decisions WRT which subreddits are default There are all kinds of other features that can show people subreddits they wouldnt normally participate in and there are drawbacks to that anyway As for preventing vote manipulation are you mad As it stands a thread has to already be popular to make it to rall so that damage is done and what youre proposing is to increase the exposure of the unwashed masses to smaller threads in smaller subreddits Necessarily since any change from show the most popular things must show less popular things than it currently does We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities The number of moderators is not the problem The problem is specifically whos on the teams A secondary problem is major communities trying to maintain standards for themselves that are fundamentally incompatible with being that size I am of course primarily referring to rscience That moderation team is unbelievably immense it cant possibly accomplish what they want the vetting process is necessarily dubious and it leads to constant complaintshttpswwwredditcomrundeletesearchqFrFsciencesortnewrestrictsron Loooong time user here  even before this account I used to use reddit for breaking news and tried my best to find something of value during the Orlando situation rall was a hot mess of rTheDonald taking aspecial view of the situation Then rnews came up a censored mess Live thread was not much help  mostly dated info I had to go to Twitter to sort out the real news Quit apologizing and fix it Seriously  reddits inability to lead has left this place a hot mess of political trolling and censuring  Lets talk about Orlando All but introductory paragraph about rnews Edit I wouldnt know where to begin talking about either issue so good luck uspez except to separate the issues entirely I doubt the victims families and friends give a shit about whatever the hell a subreddit is right now No doubt we all care but were not focused on them right now either Ive seen  fucking spez replies Hes just here for the attempt at good PR and doesnt give a fuck what we think Hes with rnews Those are his people We are not Dont fall for this bullshit Oh fuck off Reddit once again got caught with its pants down and just like always here comes Friendly Damage Control Guy It was just a few posts Inadvertently removed Just one roguecrazed mod Ill continue to use Reddit for sports news and discussion but after this escapade Reddit has completely lost my trust on anything news related The UnReddit third party site that shows a thread with every comment that has been deleted links for the megathread on rnews and even the thread on raskreddit are downright embarrassing I sifted through quite a bit of the k comments deleted and while its true some of them should have been removed there was a lot of straight up censorship as well Even comments suggesting a move to Voatco which is always the plan when Reddit does stupid shit were removed Sorry uspez  been on this site for  years I can spot yalls BS from a mile away Any mod involved should step down rnews of all fucking places should be as objective as possible Give us the facts and let us discuss instead of trying to push a stupid fucking agenda thats all you have to do Just continue this shit and you will be the next MySpace uspez I would almost say thanks for reaching out personally to the community but reading your comments I think youre not reaching out at all I see a half assed attempt at damage control and that is it Users are asking specific questions and you either ignore their posts or when you do answer you ignore the questions You make a few vague promises and then expect us to be okay with it Were not Stop understating the issues Be transparent show what you investigate what you find and what you will do Dont be a politician if a user asks something then answer the question deleted Reddit seems to have gradually taken a heavier hand in censoring content as it has grown older For a platform that once espoused an absolute belief in free speech Reddit has taken an almost paradoxical turn towards carefully cultivating a political and social message by removing content that doesnt suit its vision To be clear I am not talking about constitutionally protected freedom of speech Obviously Reddit is a private institution and can censor content on its site as they see fit Instead I am referring to the philosophy of free speech which the founders of this website once considered to be a core value Certainly illegal content must be removed Reddit cannot avoid doing so But weve gone way beyond removing illegal content Today rude distasteful or even simply unpopular comments are regularly purged Popular opinions never needed protection Free speech doesnt mean the freedom to agree or be silenced Moreover at Reddits core is a mechanism which already manages undesirable content the voting system The entire idea behind the voting system is that users can democratically choose what comments and submissions they find value in and consequently bury those they feel have no worth Taking an active hand in removing distasteful content is tantamount to an admission that Reddits moderators do not have any faith in democracy And while the voting system is certainly vulnerable to manipulation it seems that if Reddit had any faith in the values of free speech and democracy that it espoused it would focus its efforts on combating manipulation rather than censorship How do you reconcile these acts of censorship with the companys stated goals of democratization and free speech Why has the site drifted towards dictatorial control rather than user driven curation over time Do you not see this event as a direct consequence of the shift towards a more handson approach to managing content Im going to be absolutely frank on this matter I am a software engineer living in Orlando and am regularly downtown where the clubs are and I have friends regularly visit Pulse The fact that I could not find any information because of some zealous mods on the most commonly used sections for breaking news decided to censor literally everything for whatever reason shows either apathy by the controlling interests to maintain openness as has repeatedly been promised ie by the admins and reddit inc or complete ignorance for running the business You not only dropped the ball while the moderators screwed the pooch you dropkicked the pooch wide right with them clinging for hope of a homerun For many years I have not had an interest in developing a competing platform because there is no money in the market to be made I have a software background so I naturally came from newsgroups to  to digg to reddit during the first weeks where you spammed your own site for traffic no less Ive seen how one grows something people like then refuse to maintain the essence of what they made and let it become overrun by zealots of many colors The system you have built for reddit is broken and I dont mean a minor scratch but a gaping flaw that exposes the problems to everyone that has some sense of eyesight This gaping flaw could not be anymore apparent than by the cluster that was revealed today by the weekends events I am livid at not just the apathy you have exhibited towards your own platform but the blatant ignorance too I have the means and I now have the motive I dont want to bother with the mess that is social networking but if you dont change how you handle the platform as a whole then I will be forced to start working on the next iteration of what has become a perpetual social news evolution Ive done it in the travel industry already so this is not someone just blowing smoke for the sake of gaining attention This is a shot across the bow and Im genuinely pissed at what Im witnessing Call me skeptical but points  and  sound a lot like an attempt to punish rTheDonald for blowing the whistle and to prevent them or another sub from doing so again The current sticky system is what allowed rTheDonald to get the word out so fast and is heavily used by the sub for their day to day business The changes in  would prevent rTheDonald from stickying this type of thing in the future unless the mods made their own post for it and would throw a wrench in rTheDonalds current routine Point  sounds like an attempt to censor certain types of posts from rall namely ones from subreddits that like rTheDonald Also how is giving the mods of a default subreddit feedback on their policies brigading but the stuff SRS does isnt Im not on any side politically But when you have to hear about this from the Donald Trump subreddit one whos fairly controversial on here I think it points out just how bad this censoring is Every post was removed Vast amounts of comments were removed Theres an agenda on a lot of subreddits here that doesnt suit the very nature of reddit We want to discuss real things without having a fear of being banned To have our voices silenced or be called racist for mentioning facts is idiotic The mods fucked up Theres literally no other way of looking at that News should not be a default sub Its censoring news and this isnt the first time Censoring goes against the very purpose of news Im sure this might get buried but I want my voice heard This is disappointing to say the least and your dismissal of it is ridiculous We all know that the one moderator who crossed the line is just a scapegoat for all of the problems theres no way this level of censorship which it was occurred due to a single moderator However the rogue mod was so far out of line that they made themselves an easy scapegoat for the rest of the problems too Its over now and rnews will be scrutinised for a long time to come Hopefully that is enough to prevent it ever happening again Lets move on deleted Heres the Mega Thread and all of its inconvenient posts  of the ones that were deleted not being delete worthy at all httpsrgodfishmernewscommentsnqlf And heres the news on the moderator who told users to kill themselves He wasnt even gone a day httpswwwredditcomrnewscommentsnsiwstateofthesubredditandtheorlandoshootingdnram Spez I understand You as a part of reddit must wield a sword against all the evil doers of the world Open discussion was fine in the early days but now reddit has become too large too influential and you must protect the lesser classes from others forming the wrong opinions or worse scaring off investors You with your singularly just ideology must protect humanity from itself and if it just happens to make the site more profitable so be it Surely you havent just taken the ideology as a way to be popular YOU ARE JUSTICE YOU ARE THE LAW Frankly Spez get over yourself Get over your ideology rethink you world view Whatever justification you have to yourself that people need guidance that people cant be trusted to speak freely whatever the fuck you think of us that youre too polite to say It applies to you too Youll fuck up just as much as the next person and if you and the people behind the curtain at Reddit make it so no one else has a say whatever little fuck ups you have just get dialed to  This right here is a perfect example Reddit naturally deals with distasteful posts they get vote bombed to oblivion and disappear and if the system had been left to work people would have known what was happening and how to help hours before they did I understand someone would probably dig up the bad comments to make an example of how homoislamophobic the site is and it really would have hurt your feelings and maybe driven away some money but would you rather have that as well as people helping the victims of this tragedy sooner or what happened here The ideology failed Spez Turns out looking like good people isnt as important as BEING good people And it amazes me how many people cant fucking understand that We are witnessing the death of reddit This post proves they are completely out of touch with the problematic moderation on their default rnews Maybe its because the paid staff at reddit agree with the agendadriven moderation rnews mods have been censoring TPP stories for over a year now and they have yet to provide any legitimate reason as to why These mods are never held to account for their behavior except in one instance now where one of them started telling people to kill themselves Big fucking whoop Its the censorship and the refusal to allow the community to drive the discussion that is the problem We didnt subscribe to be part of some dumbass mods agenda we just want to be able to discuss the news honestly And instead the ultrapc mods are constantly removing bland posts for being offensive and other nonsense Anyway fuck reddit It really is headed down the tubes with this bullshit and you cant even see it Reddit has investigated Reddit and determined that Reddit did nothing wrong We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims they deleted comments about blood donations They nuked entire threads They banned people for literally nothing I was banned for asking where an alternative thread was to discuss it because literally the only place to talk about it for a good  hour was rthedonald Dont feed us this bullshit  We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims What about the NUMEROUS too numerous to even count people who were both banned AND muted by the mods of rnews for posting stories andor comments that were IN NO WAY hatefulbigotedetc but were instead just the facts Just because these facts seemed to be against the political ideologies of the mods of rnews they were removed and the posters were immediately banned AND muted How is this not censorship This goes beyond the one mod who told a user to kill himself Ah yes the fall guy classic Reddit That dick nuts that told someone to go kill themselves was not the only person from rnews to cross the line They didnt single handedly pull that ridiculous stunt yesterday morning All of the rnews team is culpable The idea that they were understaffed is ridiculous as well If youre a mod for rnews and a news story of that magnitude shows up on your day off and you know the sub is understaffed get your ass in there and moderate You shouldnt be making excuses for yesterdays cluster fuck I agree that the tragedy is what is most important here but rnews and their petty personal world views and politics kept people from actually assisting the victims but no youre right it was totally just that one mod get real Quick shout out and thanks to raskreddit Hey look its spez minimizing bias and coming to show what a good job the mods do and how neutral and good and worth investment reddit is Sticky posts are now called announcements This will obviously address the problems reddit doesnt have But remember what happened in Orlando is horrible so in comparison this was just a little hiccup Err or hypothetically would have been a hiccup if reddit had bias problems Which it doesnt It sounds like spez has a PR lackey permanently installed in his ass Unsure on how you came to the conclusion that censorship wasnt an issue Can you clarify please Very simple rules If you are a default sub and you participate in censorship you lose your default sub status Mods of default subs who harass users threaten users or tell users to kill themselves are demodded and possibly banned depending on severity Edit Apparently there are a lot of users on here who consider removing thoughts and ideas they dont agree with for political purposes not only acceptable but proper practice There is a difference with removing individual hate speech posts and blanketly setting up an automod to remove all instances of references to a group of people For example a comment its being reported that the shooter is Muslim and may have committed this in the name of isis should never be removed unless a sub has an explicit policy that there can be no mention of these words deleted Youre just terrible We all know what happened Shame on all of you for not owning up to it and holding them responsible Just admit that there was censorship Youre not going to please anyone by saying there wasnt any when there obviously was A person who was posting info for donating blood had his comments removed You cant honestly say there was no censorship What a load of bullshit This is yet another bullshit meaningless canned response Reddit has a big problem and youre spouting infinitesimally small solutions that dont even begin to address the real problem Here at reddit a small group of power tripping mods can hold a community of millions of users hostage with absolutely no recourse This isnt the first time something like this has happened and if major steps arent taken it certainly wont be the last When you say inane bullshit like but we will move forward together to do better next time it makes me want to vomit When you spout bold faced lies such as We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims it makes me want to scream You are so full of shit its insane One minute youre saying nothing really happened the next you are saying reddit is working hard to insure something like this never happens again As long as random anonymous users have complete control over subs without having to answer to anyone this will not only happen again this is in fact business as usual Am I seriously the only one that thinks uspez is a shameless useless lying piece of shit Are you paying attention reddit Because virtually everyone here is expressing complete disappointment in your handling of this situation No one is fooled  words to say absolutely nothing except to blame your users and absolve your collective selves of any responsibility You may as well have used the  characters in your post to give everyone an ascii middle finger Spin this however you want uspez the rest of the internet saw what happened Washington

give a human response but instead came in here with less of an informed post than that shitpost sticky on rnews Pao Edit added periods mobile site is shit I really wonder at what point uspez didnt think this came across as smarmy and condescending Can you guys go easier on censorship and injecting your personal views into the site Moderators are meant to moderate not dictate  So your answer to the blatant censorship and tight control is even MORE censorship and tighter control A few posts No evidence of censorship Not even going to read the rest uspez you left out two important words Im sorry or I apologize Hey uspez great job at answering almost no questions When you say vote manipulation do you mean that the majority actually doesnt agree with your views The censorship came almost off as homophobic Dozens of of gay lesbian and bisexual Americans were gunned down in a blaze of hatred and what does rnews do Censor people trying to donate blood find missing loved ones or discuss the latest events of this terrible crime Do we really live in a time where we in the West ignore the suffering of gays but cries foul if someone has an opinion about Islam Thanks for this I know now not to trust anything news related from this site anymore Time to start giving you less traffic have not found evidence to support these claims BULLSHIT Lets actually talk about rnews mods you fucking twat Or lets talk about censorship shadowbanning moderators from big subreddits being hiredpaid by PR agencies Moderators should be able to be removed by admins when they go on a power trip and think they are gods or some shit Fuck this Community driven What a fucking joke  We have seen the accusations of censorship We have investigated and beyond the posts that are now restored have not found evidence to support these claims Reddit has investigated Reddit and cleared Reddit of all wrongdoing Youve failed to address the core problem youve made changes to the way the site works because you didnt like what happened this weekend Instead of letting the community evolve naturally youre trying to shape it Just take a handsoff policy Its what the users want Stop interfering What happened on rnews was a catastrophe of insane proportions and an absolute embarrassment to Reddit as a whole The moderators behavior you know whos in particular was absolutely unacceptable and its very clear that rnews needs to be removed from the default subreddits and an entirely new sub needs to be created because what happened yesterday was unprecedented and asinine I can honestly say that I have on very few occasions been as disgusted and as outraged as I was about what happened yesterday It seems like every time theres a problem it has to do with some mod that people have had a problem with for ages Reddit as a primary news source is a thing of the past I think this incident is affirmation of that but it has been true for some time now Honestly the mod and admin response to the rnews train wreck is making it worse You all can keep saying youve punished the guy who crossed the line and are looking into the deleted comments issue but it all wasnt as bad as were making it out to be and I say bullshit I saw he wall of deleted comments when I went looking for news I saw this front page with absolutely no posts about the deadliest shooting in US history I saw the goddamn rAskReddit thread that had to be created so people could talk about it That is a huge failure This site failed Admit it and come up with some actual solutions to get back to a place where news can break here before you talk about being my primary news source Admit that maybe you should have been looking at rnews for months into the accusations that their mods had been selectively removing content to push an agenda Just dont patronize us wits excuses and claims that it was just a few comments removed If it werent for my local subreddit I honestly dont know if Id be spending anymore time on this site Are you peopleadmins and rnews moderators completely unaware that all the posts and comments you deleted were archived We know that your excuse is complete bullshit You purposely deleted threads and banned users the moment it was released that the shooter was a Muslim It wasnt because of duplications or racist comments we can see the posts and comments that were removed they broke no rules You even deleted posts about places to donate blood that is absolutely disgusting You are all completely full of shit and rather than just own up to it and punish rnews for their obvious biases you choose to lie in the face of readily available proof that you are completely full of shit You admins and every single one of the mods at rnews have lost all credibility and it seems youve surrounded yourself in an echo chamber full of idiots telling you everything is fine I live in a small town in the Midwest and my local radio station was even talking about the bullshit you pulled You should apologize to every person on Reddit the people that keep this website going Instead you chose to lie while anyone with a keyboard can see youre completely full of shit Very sad We are working on a change to the rall algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed Please explain what you mean by this It sounds like you are going to force things to the frontpage over things users have actually upvoted Does not sound good at all Also sounds like regular PC rhetoric and just another way of saying you are going to implement some more censorship and fudge the votes deleted Can you make the mobile website stop bugging me about downloading the app and bringing up misleading popups that try to get you to download it Thats great and all but every post ive attempted to make about the extreme limitations of the redesign has been met with no response whatsoever I made a post on the last announcement that got a few hundred upvoteshttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsnyjashortishhistoryofnewfeaturesonredditdvr and Ive sent a modmail to you guys directly which too was ignored I literally cannot replicate any of the communities ive created with the redesign its just not possible with the tools provided  You cannot align flairs to the left  You cannot set post gradients  Thumbnail heightwidth is nonadjustable  You cannot set different thumbnails for different post types NSFWSpoilers etc  Very little control over the now single header image we can pick  No control over fonts  No control over how background images are used in posts  No ability to customise flair colours  Theres obviously more all these were just off the top of my head Obviously moving away from CSS theres going to be some limitations but most of what ive just detailed is on an extremely basic level I just want to be able to have at least some resemblance of what ive currently got put together on subs ive worked on such as rNieR and rTacticalDolls which i only put together last week Sub screenshotshttpsimgurcomajSVd With the whole rProCSS thing you guys said wed be able to keep some form of CSS control over our subs when exactly will we be able to see and test this If i can at least do half the stuff ive mentioned here Ill be happy but with the lack of news on this im not exactly hopeful Good to know nightmode is being worked on the white background always bothers me when Im sitting in my room in total darkness and isolation at  am wondering where my life went wrong i was so excited to see what yall had planned for April fools where is it at Please tell me you have something planned Is there somewhere we can see how much of our user generated and tracking information is available for advertisers and thirdparties Saw this yesterday httpswwwredditcomrstopadvertisingcommentsdsqpsareddithasenhancedtheirtrackingtheynow Will reddit be in a similar situation as Facebook regarding privacy and how you track your users Have you made any changes in the wake of all the bad PR that Facebook is receiving Why did everything go closed source For some time now if I click on a link and then hit back in my browser it reloads the previous page Its super irritating to be  comments deep click a youtube link and then not be able to get back to the same bit of comments Its been worse in the last few weeks since youve apparently change the algorithms to make front pages more fresh Sometimes I see two stories I want to read click the first read for a few minutes go back and my entire front page is different I cant find the other article no matter how hard I look As an aside Later at night the front page is half full with stuff that should be in new Its all stuff with one or fewer votes no comments and that has no business being on my front page What gives The back button shouldnt trigger a refresh It breaks the entire web browser paradigm for no good reason If you MUST refresh at least put me back into the same location in the DOM for comment sections after the refresh Its totally pointless to leave me scrolled to the same spot in the page when the comment there now arent any of the same ones I was looking at when I left the page in the first place deleted I think we should start this years April without them my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined Where is April fools As someone with no tech background Im really glad that the git hub python server Js apps query is fixed Do I fit in yet Yay I cant wait for Reddit to consume an assload of CPU time and GB of RAM to show me the exact same information  Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wishwe do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesnt want to use it Will this always be the case Im fine with the way things are and will never want to use the new design Open Jobs at Reddit Software Engineer Searchhttpsboardsgreenhouseioredditjobs Best news Ive heard all day Please stop asking me to use the new mobile site Please stop asking me to download your app Please stop redirecting me to the new mobile site to view images and videos hosted on Reddit If youre going to force me to do that then please make it a thousand times faster The age of loading screens is long gone I do not want to stare at a pulsating snoo Nothing makes me hate your product more than that goddamned fucking snoo Please dont abandon the mredditcom site Its like Reddit lite for those who dont care about shiny bullshit WE WANT THE PRANK If I spent my entire Easter in a discord with  people yelling refreshing a couple of locked subreddits for absolutely no payoff or cool event then Im very sad  My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined When will the obnoxious go to the reddit app ads on mobile go away I know you guys are in the process of removing it but I dont want to open up the hamburger menu everytime I open up reddit Because I sure as hell want it sooner than September or an unannounced deadline TLDR slowly redesign the site to become a social media site like fb so we can monetize the user base I was so hyped for April fools this year  Why are you tracking us through the API Is it true that the new updates will severely limit the number of flairs available on subs as well as the ability to doubleflair Because I can tell you right now that this will not go over well in sports subs especially rCFB OMG i just tried the redesign IT SUCKS I think were about to witness DIGG v No April fools  Id love to buy yall a pack for your efforts but Ill get banned if I do No April fools social experiment this year rplace is what got me to use Reddit You guys dropped the ball if nothing is planned Soooo in light of the ongoing FB debacle what can you tell us about privacy concerns and data scrapingcollection on users When will the search feature be even somewhat useful When are you going to turn off the little orange indicator that is trying to convince me to start a chat when I have no intention of ever doing so PRANK OR RIOT Yall could have reopened place today smh Prank waiting room Whole world is April st expect Baker Island which means it will come out in  minutes Right guys Please If the reddit administrators think they can hide policy announcements behind new and impersonal accounts or send the engineering team out to talk to avoid discussions of recent administrative actions without receiving backlash they are mistaken Im sure the engineers at reddit are doing a fine job but until we get some serious discussion about the recent subreddit banning and general hypocrisy from admins Im really not interested in anything the engineering team or anyone else has to say Stop fucking around with us The time for PR is over quit tactically handling your community and speak to us with some honesty Funny how this announcement was made by an admin using their own account instead of that chickenshit throwaway account used in that bullshit subreddit banning announcement deleted snake when Haha they replied to all the nonsubstantial posts while ignoring the ones with the bulk of the meat Reddit has been going downhill in my book for a while and after that subreddit ban hope yall have the wits to not apply and take your careers elsewhere this is gonna be a dead site in a bit ive been waiting for almost  hours now reddit pls Have you made any consideration regarding the ability to browse reddit posts without JavaScript enabled I mentioned this two weeks agohttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsnyjashortishhistoryofnewfeaturesonredditdvrexf and before that over a month agohttpswwwredditcomrblogcommentsulkheywereheretotalkaboutthatdesktopredesigndtlbwor Both posts gained about  upvotes and one was gilded  I am NOT the only person concerned about this As a  year user of the site mandatory JS just to read the site is one of the few things you can do to drive me away You already do that on the mobile interface which is why I do not use it Please do not repeat that on desktop reddit Why do you feel the need to add new features What was wrong with the previous profile page Its a terrible laggy UI now Thank god RES lets you switch back to normal Redesign so that ads can be better implemented right Just great This would fill me with a lot more confidence if I had not just had to use script and element filtering on the browser end to rid myself of a bugged and unclearable reddit chat notification Or to rephrase that a feature just rolled out with an incredibly annoying bug which breaks the user experience by training the users to ignore the new message notification Notification badges are not exactly new technology Previously a block feature rolled out which makes the blockee invisible to the blocker but not the other way around Ignore is not the same thing as block except here on reddit If someones being stalked or harassed they cant hide from the perpetrator They can just cover their eyes and pretend they are hiding Or they can give up their karma post history and subreddit reputation to make a new account This is outright dangerous to users who assume block means block not ignore since they cant tell if the person they blocked is still following them around reddit Block is supposed to be a barrier neither party can cross Instead we have a setup where a blocked user can read posts from and post responses to the person who blocked them as well as voting on their karma If some of those responses are for example explicit and actionable threats of the sort that merit police involvement the blocker would never even know Personally I think if you block someone that means they should no longer get to follow you around threatening to rape you Especially not without you knowing theyre doing it WAITING FOR THE PRANK Its past  this is disappointing One of the biggest features that is missing from the redesign that Im worried will not be coming back is time based searching Many tools used the ability to search for posts in a certain time range and the recent search changes have removed that ability Now you have no way of knowing what was submitted past the  posts in the new listing or whatever shows up in the other  post long listings Ive been using React since late  and I think this is a huge fail especially choosing Redux Its a popular choice much like Angular  was  years ago but it introduces a lot of unneeded complexity Why not just use VueVuex Soooo any word about that APRIL FOOLS Where is the aprio fools thing that Reddit does every year Like rplace Have you heard the expression If it aint broke dont fix it Just remember how quickly companies like Digg and Myspace vanished into the nether when they thought they were serving visitors but just rolled out features nobody wanted deleted Thats great and all but every post ive attempted to make about the extreme limitations of the redesign has been met with no response whatsoever I made a post on the last announcement that got a few hundred upvotes and Ive sent a modmail to you guys directly which too was ignored I literally cannot replicate any of the communities ive created with the redesign its just not possible with the tools provided You cannot align flairs to the left You cannot set post gradients Thumbnail heightwidth is nonadjustable You cannot set different thumbnails for different post types NSFWSpoilers etc Very little control over the now single header image we can pick No control over fonts No control over how background images are used in posts No ability to customise flair colours Theres obviously more all these were just off the top of my head Obviously moving away from CSS theres going to be some limitations but most of what ive just detailed is on an extremely basic level I have a suggestion Just dont Reddit works reliably now The mobile interface has been trash for a long time but Im able to comfortably use the desktop interface on my phone with no problem and full features Knowing the history of dev teams that couple up with new inexperienced designers who want to make things better because someone spent  days in google analytics there will be a focus on being mobile first and whatever you do will suck worse than the current basic years old desktop interface Best thing I did last year was to disable the persubreddit css styling Dont give people the ability to screw up the standard interface So dont change the interface Make things better on the backup but dont change the interface I have a few thoughts on this im just gonna drabble on and hope uanandm or anyone really reads thisshrug The thing is nothing is going to render faster than static HTML I remember reading news on someGermanWebsite earlier today and after dropping in what was probably a MB javascribt blob it took about  seconds to display the arcticle I get that you need some tracking cookies ad websites  to finance and make use of us clicking your things But this isnt user experience The same informatin could have been on my screen alot faster And i have ad block enabled no idea what that would have been without And that outlines my problemfear pretty well The redesign while needing about the same time to load as the good old stuff lets ignore the reocurring requests in the end httpsimgurcomaBWeOk takes quite a bit longer to show the actual stuff i want to see  I know  seconds or so isnt much but it just feels so bad I have not looked into it more Ive not been a webdev for years now but what is stopping you from shipping static html and ads and the other stuff that you want to be seen first first and then letting the javascript do the magic and load stuff like infinite scroll etc afterwards The design itself i cant really complain about though Still the same informationdense display at least on desktop i really like just a bit more fancy And a useable subredditmenu If you now could make it respond as fast and consume the same amout of cpuram Just let us keep the Stylesheets please Anyways I hope i could somehow say what i wanted with this xx Great glad we have you Do you have a timeline to fix thishttpsimgurcomBtAygr I cant clear this stupid chat notification and its making me crazy Any chance of making reddit open source again since you closed it last year  on this question not getting answered What data exactly does your new tracking system track I dont really care about the redesign I tried it did not like it Went back The thing that I was are better mod tools There is so much stuff that are just put in with duct tape Flairing posts automod This is WAY more complicated than it should be Cant I just upload an image to the flair page Then let users select it Cant I just have a bunch of if and than statements for automod The mod tools suck The mod backend sucks The subreddit themeing sucks  Hey reddit dont bother with the fucking search functionality Its fine Were all just awaiting the next social media platform anyway I want to reiterate what some others have said as I feel they are important Keep the site lightweight I dont want a bunch of javascript and excess code It slows things down has more chance for bugs and is less compatible What happened to rGundeals They werent breaking any rules Can reddit be open source again So I can make Reddit dark to match my soul Fantastic rsnakeroom when The april fools thing Ssssoon  were moving forward at a rate of  features and  bugs per month Youre only creating  bugs per month Not bad Hey yeah could you guys please stop trying to turn Reddit into social media I came here to escape Facebook not get absorbed into a new version of it Oh good bulk mod actions I was just wondering yesterday if it would be possible to help the mods be assholes at superhuman speed Glad youre on it Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wishwe do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesnt want to use it You people are awesome are you gonna troll us all with this april fools thing Why are you tracking everything we do Reddits move away from open source is really disappointing Is all hope truly lost Nothing As a mobile user reddit on chrome I wasnt able to commentvoteinteract for the longest time Thank you guys for fixing this issue with the last update this april fools was awesome REDDIT WAS FINE STOP MAKING REDDIT SHITTIER AND SHITTIER WELL GO BACK TO DIGG uanandm uspez Sorry to highjack the discussion but seeing as how your sock puppet account uRedditPolicy refuses to address any of the thousands of questionsconcerns posed in the last announcement thread will one of you please grow a pair and provide an explanation for the rGunDeals ban Why was a subreddit with over  subscribers nuked without any warning without any rule violations and without any attempt by reddit to work with the mods to address content concerns Also just as a reminder every firearm that was purchased by a reddit user through one of the websites linked in rGunDeals required a federal background check so Reddits boilerplate rationale of we cant guarantee the legality of the sale does not and did not ever apply Please make it possible again to iterate over all submissions in a subreddit The removal of the cloudsearch syntax from the search website interface last year and API this month removed this ability and we now have to rely on thirdparty solutions redditsearchioPushshift in particular deleted BAMBOOZLED Are you guys doing anything to circumvent the use of AdBlock or similar browser addons As Reddit transfers into more of a Facebook type of site I am worried we are going to be riddled with ads that will make the site look horrible and less user friendly Especially with ads masquerading as user driven content Hey engineers can you add a config to disable infinite scroll I hate this feature like I hate Nazis Im asking you because the other Reddit announcer people keep ignoring the question Please fix the bug where theres always a chat notification no matter how many times you click on it What are you going to do about your massive censorship problem  Automod and other bots frequently shadow delete comments for no good reason  Cliques of neckbeards who utilize ircslackchatdiscord to organize often mod dozens or hundreds of subreddits many of them high profile Further too often the default moderation actions and deletions are hidden by default Only if you use a private browser tab or cedditcom can you find out your posts are deleted That is highly disrepectful to the hundreds of millions contributing content They are often being censored and they dont even know it despite wasting time crafting threads and replies How about you actually do something about and acknowledge the real problems of this medium Try to make transparency required to moderate a subreddit and make all moderation actions and deletions public raddle and Voat already allow this On Reddit rconspiracy has transparent moderation using public modlogs Limit the number of subreddits someone can moderate to something like  to curb the power of the super neckbeards who trade subreddit turf like nerds of previous generations traded Pokemon or Magic the Gathering cards yeah thats great but rgundeals tho wtf is this designhttpsiredditmediacomqxwYIzITNTVWKQREdoiHTEKDvVvTKjhvFGjXyUFApngwsdddfeceabbbd And why the hell does clicking on something makes the thread appear in a popup Are we doing popups now In  Is Reddit becoming tumblr Dont copy tumblr Thats Pinterest levels of crap I demand rationale behind these changes They dont make any fucking sense We have tabs today Literally everybody can just open  times if they want ctrlclicking and click the back button if they want to go back It works in virtually every website ever since ever Theres no reason to mangle the site Im looking at by making a thread pop in the middle of it And putting the reply button on the left side is just pantsonheads retarded Whats the motive behind this besides we had to change something so we just MOVED THE MOST CLICKED BUTTON ON REDDIT and put something that does EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WANT beside it relearn ur buttons fools srlsy wat deleted I hope youre not trying to justify proprietary source code again I came from the great Digg fuck up and I just not comfortable with change Please dont ruin Reddit Honestly I dont give a shit any more my biggest use of reddit now is to find an alternative to reddit This is an April Fools joke I tried the new design and its identical to the old one Any chance of bringing back rGundeals If anyones interested I found a hard drive in my garage with the original Reddit Lisp codehttpsgithubcomredditreddit from  Been looking for it for years Enjoy So yet another site is going to become unusable without javascript Wonderful How about a feature to block admins axe from chopping off subs without proof darknetmarkets gets a post about behaviors and is told not to worry just a warning  minutes later it and  others are gone for no documented reason How many million users locked out of their neighborhood Sucks big time And I gave gold for this fascist behavior We have moved on as Reddit reinventing China under chairman Mao management is not a community we want to belong to Very cool Hey remember that one time reddit blatantly banned rgundeals even though it didnt violate a single reddit rule Reddit back at it again with the ignoring real issues and doing things no one wants Are you guys actually gonna shill us out and prank with snake room then close it Really Either bring back rgundeals or go fuck yourself Very nice What actions have you taken to respond to the massive misinformation campaign that exploited your technology Neat a post where the admins arent talking about how they want to censor Reddit So basically the new code is being written using the DENNIS system Got it As a Redux maintainer Im excited to see this  Id love to hear more details on the app architecture project setup and how your React  Redux experience has gone What Redux addons are you using if any What sort of pain points and problems have you run into I need help Im new  What is the moose icon that pops up when I try to post Turns out rcircleoftrust is the April Fools this year Weve started our own faction rcirkle to prepare Come on over if youre interested Im just here for the riot Keep putting up inline images personalized profiles with useless information and promoted content you will lose just like Facebook has lost The users always win  But can your engineers think of a way to justify banning rgundeals Will we get a preview some point soon Im excited to see what it will look like Interesting note Especially that several engineers seemed to have left went and did other stuff for awhile and then came back What is the corporate policy around that Is it invited and welcomed To leave on good enough terms that after theyve learned in other areas they can come back stronger rgundeals was unjustly banned Bring it back or at least be man enough to discuss it deleted It still amazes me how few people actually keep Reddit running given how big it is Stop banning firearm subs wheres my SZECHUAN SAUCE  Fuck Reddit bring back rgundeals GunDealsDidNothingWrong Bring back rgundeals Bring back rgundeals you heathens PRAISE BE THE MODS AND ADMINS THEY DID IT You banned gundeals and i hate you Guys its not april st for another  months what are you doing It takes  minutes to load an image in a post but you can get annoying videos to play instantly I dont get it Okay so I have video autoplay set to WiFi only yet this thing is constantly streaming at the top of my page even when Im using mobile data Even if I click hide its still clearly streaming in the background If this keeps up it will absolutely tank my data on my phone So who asked for this because I rather have a working search feature Can we please get rid of it on the front page or at least get an option to hide it On the app on my iPhone at least there was no way of hiding pausing or muting the video Scrolling down didnt work quite often autoplay videos stop when outofview That alone would be enough for me to stop using the Reddit app as long as this content is in it  Didnt the admins say they will avoid interrupting user experience with these events and announcements Whats up with that We dont want this shit Yaaaaayyyy another live feed thing to avoid completely How to turn it off forever   Why wasnt this announced in rannouncementshttpswwwredditcomrannouncements or on rblog until after it released  Why is this not placed in its own subreddit  Why is there a button for this in my nav bar  Why is there a lineitem in my post feed about this It isnt a post so why is it masquerading as one  Why are there voting icons next to this if were not allowed to vote on it  Why can I not hide it without Ublock  Why did you do this I block all vredditcom videos already as they dont load properly and ruin my feed Perhaps getting video working smoothly for all users would be a better starting point Is this an out of season April Fools joke Ok well I for one actually enjoy this feature so heres some actual feedback  Please please remove the thing where RPAN automatically changes videos after a certain amount of time A lot of the broadcasts are music or ASMR things that we have on in the background to listen to so the autoplay thing ruins that  Remove the RPAN icon from the top bar on the redesign or at least grey it out so it doesnt look like a notification  Make it more obvious how to start a stream yourself I still cant find that button EDIT Its only on mobile Why  You should really add a sidebar that allows you to scroll through all the streams like a normal reddit thread Its so tedious going one by one and its hard to go back to one that you already passed Fuck this shit is annoying So I tried tuning in and its someone doodling a cartoon and half the video screen is a note trying to get you to follow their Instagram I went to the next video and its literally a person taking a shit Whats the purpose Instagram Advertisement  httpswwwredditcomrpanctae NSFW Pooping Person  httpswwwredditcomrpanctwv Thanks this is terrible How do I turn it off and get moderator features youve promised for like a decade Does this mean I have to see more guys with manbuns playing guitar in a white vneck on my frontpage deleted Reddit doesnt want to be a link sharing and discussion website they want to be a click farm catering to instagrammers who follow influencers and the type of people who watch fail compilations on youtube Dear Reddit investors what you bought into was bullshit this is a very advertiserhostile community fuck your metricsengagementmindshare cash out now before your investment tanks like Digg Thank god theyve fixed all the platforms problems and have time to fuck around on shit like this This is so fucking weird and is going to be abused to shit by so many people Seems like a huge waste of time and resources  Can you get this shit OFF my home screen First stream I went tohttpsiimgurcomIgEodElpng How exactly are these streams moderated No one wants this bring back old reddit as default If your chat functionality is any indication this will work super well Is rgonewild going to participate Or will be NSFW free  httpsboardsgreenhouseioredditjobshttpsboardsgreenhouseioredditjobs xB Its only the tip of the iceberg Get this shit out of my feed you fuck Nobody wants this How long until you develop a section specifically for NSFW stuff though I never believed Reddit was trying to be Facebook until right now This is Facebook Live What in the sam hill kentucky fried crispy fuck did you bring on this platform I escaped here because of all the cringe but as it turns out this platform is also infected Reddit is trying to come for youtube But I thought our whole shtick was the anonyminity I am flabbergasted to say the least This is a pointless idea If I want to watch a livestream I will go to Twitch or YouTube or Facebook or any other site with a robust livestreaming feature Considering how problematic vreddit is Reddit is the last place I would be watching a livestream on If at the very least NSFW content was allowed then some people might find a use for it but I dont see myself using this feature at all Yet again Reddit has taken another step towards becoming Facebook  Why am I not surprised anymore Fuck that Reddit isnt and shouldnt be a social network like the others Get outta here with that And dont remove old Reddit What are you hoping to test with this I want to use my remaining  battery in my phone to express my humble opinion about that it is so This is bad and you should feel bad Now you can livestream your assaults murders crimes and acts of terror on reddit too I just want to go on record and say this is a bad idea Please dont do this Already blocked the banner with uBlock The streaming works on desktop web why is it blocked on mobile web please dont do this There are plenty of video sites that do this sort of thing and the more reddit tries to be like all the other sites the worse the community issues get There are already issues with mods and content on reddit why do we need to add more issues reddits current tools dont address by adding streaming video Theres no way that this could end badly I hate this fucking feature Id love to not have livestreaming piles of shit on Reddit reddit can you please stop shoving your dick down my throat for a minute so I can breathe We dont want this on our homepage Thanks I absolutely hate it Yo anyone got some cool alternative site to Reddit Remember the Great Digg Migration of  We came to Reddit because it wasnt trying to be anything it wasnt Theyve since flipped it completely on its head and created and sometimes foster a place as toxic as anything on the internet This PAN network will be used the same as anything else on this website  to spread disinformation and divide Its a shame People need to stop watching so their test shows its a horrible intrusive decision and they made a bad design choice with it I thought Reddit was a place for me to follow subjects Im interested in and contribute a little in return I didnt realise its now a mix of Facebook  YouTube and twitch and I have to see things I have no interest in whatsoever  I have even had to go through and unfollow anybody I was following as your now sharing all that info with the people followed Reddit is going to the dogs and quite quickly  going to kill off many users with these upcoming changes This should definitely be a lot more limited time than presently I dont care about someones daily activities Reddit does this Reddit users why Will it have mass shootings like Facebook Why was this announced after rolling out And why can I not actually hide it I dont want to see it at all I would like to yeet it off a cliff please not minimize it Its not April st is it Is there a light theme option for the chat This is a really important accessibility feature since some people with astigmatism have a very hard time reading light text on dark background since it makes the letters appear fuzzy and blurred I understand this is a limited time feature but simply having a toggle for light and dark theme is such a basic thing and there are people who need one or the other and neither is ever any more or less important than the other If there is an option for light theme in the chat I cant find it and thus I think it should be made more obvious to find What the actual fuck am I watching and why is this on my feed This fucking sucks SFW The internet war on sex continues Pass How do I not have it on my screen No one cares I have a feeling its just going to be a bunch of dicks I dont even care enough to see what it is Its August th at  GMT When trying to visit RPANhttpwwwredditcomrpan I only get a  error As a side note that should really be a httpsLink I know it automatically redirects but still reddit is becoming more like snapchat trash time to find a new site How do I hide it Or block it Autoplay with LOUD FUCKING NOISES is a terrible introduction to a feature Yikes reddit admin team you just posted cringe Why is it all vertical video What is this  Please allow me to opt out of rpan asap This is not something I want on Reddit If youre not willing to do that I will gladly avoid Reddit until this limitedtime experience is over xB EDIT Cool Its been  hours Goodbye reddit See you on the th then I was using the official reddit app but this made me uninstall and switch to apollo Is it already dead The link doesnt even work Thats hilarious if true Dumb idea  Oh wow vertical filming even when its not RIP Reddit or content that would be seen as highly offensiveupsetting to the average redditor will result in a banned account Everything is highly offensive to the average redditor Why Get rid of this shit already Sounds so fucking shit Who asked for this So how long until tittystreamers take it over I hate it I dont like how it autostarts on the app I actually deleted the app because of it What is highly offensive and upsetting to the average Redditor will be what your advertisers dictate right pretentious lying overlord admins brimming with integrity Who asked for this Why does it exist Why was it not announced Do you actually think this is a good idea Its really annoying that youre treating shitty cat streams as the future of communication Stop putting this shit in my feed if I wanted to watch some random guy load peaches into a van for an hour Id reevaluate my life choices and jump off a fricking bridge No one gives a shit Seriously fuck the people who is in charge of all these decisions I honestly hope this website dies as soon as possible and you are left with your fucking stupid faces wondering why it flopped so bad Requires redesign its a nope from me dawg yeah no one wants this Welcome to Instagram Shut the fuck up moron the REDDIT CHAT ROULETTE Dumb The internet was a mistake How about next time you dont add nonsense to my feed without an optin When will it go away please Hiding it only collapses it into a huge bar with an obnoxious font permanently stuck to the top of my feed Please let me turn it off or let me know what times of day I can browse reddit without it yay yet another feature no one asked for while important features for the community go on being ignored How do I remove this stupid thing STOP TURNING REDDIT INTO FACEBOOK This is hot garbage how can I opt out for real Im not installing your shitty app Fuck reddit What are you going to do when someone uses RPAN to stream a mass shooting For once Im thankful that the admins refuse to deal with white nationalism on this site I foresee thedonald spamming this with hate speech the media picking up the story and reddit shutting this down Thanks neonazis you make reddit a worse place but you also make it impossible to monetize Please can you remove this feature NOW its incredible annoying I dont come to reddit because I want to enjoy periscope I really dont know what happened to pass to your mind when you decided to roll this out but in my opinion is really really really really an error and even more force us to have it in the front page and in the navbar in orange If you didnt know how to upset your userbase you just figured it out Oh look more shit nobody wants reddit sucks so bad lol Stoppppppp Cannot wait to see how this implodes WHY Just gonna copy paste my comment from a post on beta discussing this feature for me as of right now it looks like thishttpsimgurcomaFBemEB So it takes a massive amount of space and you cant hide it edit also it updates every few seconds either changing the thumbnails or the lives displayed I hate it Get it off my feed Fuck the reddit admins The founder of reddit is rolling in his grave over what pathetic agendapushing sellouts you guys are You should be ashamed of yourselves but Im sure you arent How can we optout from this User choice is good yes I dont want to have to keep skipping past it andor hiding it This is dumb Im still waiting for you ass holes to quit bugging me about your awful app Now this Reddit was fine on its own to compete with other social media why are you trying to be like everyone else Another reminder that the rd party apps dont have this crap I personally enjoy using Reddit Is Fun RIF on Android Yeah add stupid features But dont fix the broken shit that needs fixing Classic reddit Thank you baconreader None of this nonsense for me You guys are fucking killing me with wanting to make this website more social network oriented m I know its all about the cash and clicks and all that but this isnt Reddit and you all know this Be careful with how cocky you think this platform is and how solid of a hold you all think you have The internet is a pretty fickle place especially when you do dumb shit like this with no warning With plans to keep pushing it even more in the future Its not cool and not Reddit Another platform for narcissists yay Announcing the annoying thing that you cant truely remove from your view Featuring broken chat p video and the most uninteresting streams you have ever seen Oh and dont forget the usless vote system to remind you that this is reddit One more nail in the Reddit coffin Remember FUCK uspez How about you announce an option to STOP RECOMMENDING POLITICS Some of us come to Reddit to relax and escape the idiot arguments and we dont want the app fighting against our quest for peace How long until someone livestreams a suicide Dont you guys have some CCP critical comments to remove or pedo subs to pander to Fuck you Fix your cockroach infested sewers before putting something shiny in the top of this manure sundae Wow this certainly wont be used to censor literally everyone and allow only status quo viewpoints  astroturfed video to be pushed on all of us No way that could ever happen Sounds as promising as the Chat feature and personalizing profiles with photos cat live streams So you still havent implemented a feature for us to delete messages from our inbox but have time to create a livestreaming service nobody asked for Glad theres another feature Ill probably never use  First and foremost this is about having fun as a Reddit community Narrator Voice It wasnt  and if you all enjoy it Narrator Voice They didnt  well continue to explore how it might work as an actual feature Narrator Voice It didnt  We genuinely want to hear what you all think I think that you should not censor content for being upsetting to the average Redditor whether it is pornographic conspiratorial violent or highly offensive I dislike that you have completely abandoned your free speech values as a company in favor of corporate friendliness Even five years ago you would at least pretend to care about such concerns and accuse those who believed this would create future problems of the slippery slope fallacy But now almost every time you make an announcement on whats tolerated on Reddit it is further and further circumscribed There are groups that outright grease the slippery slope within your company and your userbase by intentionally seeking precedents to use as justification for further ratcheting restrictions on acceptability and nobody says anything at all meaningful against it If you had refused to play this game from the start would you have so many demanding Danegelds today Whats preventing you from pulling a Tumblr in six months and dying off for it rhellofellowkids Periscope did this way better like  years ago Get that video of a guy painting a sword off my front page you idiots What So glad I still use alien blue so I dont need to know what any of this stupid shit is lol Is this an April Fools joke Im sorry what is this madness Confirmed Live streaming coming to Reddit soon attempt to compete with Twitch maybe Feels like a bad move would rather see the revenue side of things cleaned up before a bandwidth hog like live streaming video added Reddit is becoming new instagram Ive checked this out  days in a row now and the streams are excruciatingly boring Most of them are just people petting their dog or cat Why would I tune in to this ever again freaking ridiculous I know someone worked hard on this but does the internet really need more cat videos Please allow us to stop it on mobile its killing my bandwidth Good to know Reddit now has celebrities like Youtube and Twitch Nothing to cheer up your escapist trip to social media like being reminded of how much of a loser you are compared to these INFLUENCERS So far Ive watched a guy play with his cat and a modem blinking Revolutionary Thanks for the unexpected loud auto play video that opens when I accidentally clicked on this guys Jesus H Fuck Edit This was the push I needed to dump the official app in favor of Apollo If youre keeping score I also switched back to old reddit on desktop because of the related communities feature This blows Someones gonna do a mass shooting and live stream it Calling it now what a shitty feature Fuck off with this shit This is a fucking retarded idea Who greenlit this Fire them immediately God what a fucking waste of time and resources You people are predawn Digg and you dont even realize it Bye Reddit Useless admins I hope Reddit fails Like almost all the changes and innovations from the reddit team in the last  years this does not add to the usefulness of reddit Reddit is not a streaming platform period The users of reddit either host their content elsewhere or they dont care at all You want to start a streaming site then start a streaming site But this feature will never work because it is a distraction from Reddits core feature set Its things like this and the horrid new reddit redesign that cause me to go seek alternatives Stop underestimating and exploiting your user base I respect trying to innovate but this is not what this is Its a new way for them to feed us ads I love Reddit how it is rnobodyasked I have only watched a few streams and most of the streamers said to follow them on twitter instagram or other things Plus the comments on the streams are utter horror Some of the commenters break every rule that is set up for RPAN There is no way to stream without some kind of comment moderation If you actually want people to participate why is it only active during regular west coast work hours Must feel bad to have your new feature unanimously unwanted and hated lolol Cant wait to see somebody commit a mass murder using rpan Im kidding obviously but I wouldnt be surprised if that ended rpan prematurely No This is horrible No one wants this You guys are adding shit thats making this website the very type of web platform a lot of us have ran from And now you are making Reddit fall into that category Just stop Its not cool ah awesome now  yo pimply suburban kids can broadcast them being racist live Till date i only had to read their comments now i get to watch them calling black people monkeys Why is tencent bringing this out now during the HK protest Not very smart but good for the protestors they should stream on here  Why the fuck Dont you have better things to do What made you think to yourself that this would be a good idea stop doing things How long until the first murder on it Could there be two Reddits One that goes back to before all the money making social media bullshit that everyone enjoys and the other one could be the ad invested horse diarrhea social site you are trying to make it This is going to be a no from me Reddit marketing meeting How can we appeal to the kids more How about some type of live streaming thing Ooh how fun Can we make it morestreet Umwecouldadd a black guy in there some where Ooh a black guy How fun Can we include some rap Im excited This is exciting Is anyone else excited  chance this goes horribly awry Wow  Im gonna have a great time NEVER ever using this fucking nonsense Jesus christ start implementing what people have asked for instead of making up what you think we want We DO NOT WANT an extension of facebook Are you going to let shooters livestream their content on this platform If not how do you plan to prevent it Its saying the page doesnt exist Is it only available in the redesign rBlackPeopleTwitter prevents you from participating in some threads unless you take a photo of your arm to prove you are the correct color Does reddit endorse this racebased discrimination And if so may other subreddits implement this practice with your approval ligma balls Glad I stick with the compact view my data allowance also thanks me  uses maybe th of the data the mobile  desktop views do so I dont have to put up with that pointless bullshit trying to intrude on my Redditting same way I dont have to put up with the equallystupid chat system Wait I didnt subscribe to this subreddit GET BIASED POLITICS OUT OF THE FRONT PAGE How come yesterday I was able to view it but today I cant Oh I wondered what the ruddy hell that was Scared the bejesus out of me Hol up guys I gotta login and get my Reddit Dailies Is this going to be locked to NuReddit only I still prefer greatly the old design You can add in livestreaming but you cant add back page views This is my first thought httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfpicMQCEhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfpicMQCE how long till we get porn on there What will you do to prevent users from streaming horrible acts such as shootings and other crimes xB I dont want to see something happen like this httpsnypostcommaninadvertentlylivestreamsmassshootingonfacebookhttpsnypostcommaninadvertentlylivestreamsmassshootingonfacebook on reddit Nobody asked for this We dont want a buzzfeed Didnt you guys try this already with Reddit news Please stop This aint fb get the fuck outa here Kill it with fire we need quality control You gave me some fucking weird neckbeard in a mask If that is the reason why there is a cat video at the top of my feed please remove it I will not be forced to watch crap I dont choose to I will delete the app first This does not add to the core usefulness of reddit This just distracts from the core feature set Reddit will never be a streaming platform Period Paul Graham probably would not approve this feature You want to start a streaming site then start a streaming site But this feature will never work because it is a distraction from Reddits core usefulness I cannot believe you guys are spamming our feeds like this Its things like this that cause me to go seek alternatives Dont spam your user base man i just love it becuze all streams are lofi anyone can start and still get an audience Can streams be arranged by page so we can better see what wed be interested in instead of having to swipe to find something After some time of swiping and not seeing anything people would just quit and head to Twitch Youtube etc or content that would be seen as highly offensiveupsetting to the average redditor So in other words almost everything Ok well I for one actually despise this feature so heres some actual feedback  Please please make a feature for when these type of things come out that we can remove it entirely from our feed If I hit hide I do not want to even see it anymore It still shows that something is hidden and that there are  viewers I dont care  Remove the RPAN icon from the top bar on the redesign or at least grey it out so it doesnt look like a notification  Make a feature that allows people to comment on the live stream I only like reddit for the comments  You should keep the style and theme the same with the rest of reddit It is disturbing to look at So this is no different than Chatroulette Wont be long before its just dudes jacking it How do I turn it off Its very annoying and I am not interested at all No thank you How do I turn this junk off This is insanely cancerous Please kill it with fire and extreme prejudice And theyre only replying to positive feedback too Seems like our opinions are really valued Why do I get autosubbed to this sub Can you get rid of it the app allready runs slow and doesnt load videos half the time never minds gifs Okay seriously my phone is just playing random background noise when Im on Reddit now Like someone is streaming themselves just sitting in their living room or something Its happening right now as Im typing this comment Is there any system put in place to stop this from being used to broadcast criminal acts such as mass shootings Someones going to stream murder or rape over this How long is gonna take for someone to live stream a mass shooting on this Can people report streams Inb chan sees this and does some fuckshit on live stream So when will the NSFW version launch Asking for a friend cause his lube is starting to dry out How do you plan to deal with the inevitable events where people livestream crimes  violence Facebook has a huge problem with this and putting it on a platform like Reddit where it is essentially the front page of the internet seems like it is only a matter of time before people do the same here Honestly it feels like a mistake to do this without a real effective plan to stave off these streams I cant help but feel they will be the things that get upvoted to the front So again how do you plan to prevent this and be proactive Banning their account seems like something they wouldnt care about after the fact There should be some transparency over how often and when reddit has stepped in to remove streams and why This is fucking stupid and you should put an end to it or Ill remove each of my testicles on rpan Is porn allowed its stupid as fuck dont watch it Isnt it weird how its only a month away from the Area  raid this is where i say fuck reddit and abandon it i believe I dont like it Please include an opt out Why is this in my subscription feed I didnt subscribe to it nor would I PLEASE put this in the ALL feed or some other shitfest Please get this shit off my feed Can I have a way to disable this Its burning mobile data like the Amazon right now Are there resteictions on how many people can broadcast at once Because I want to test this out but everytime I click the broadcast button it always tells me I cant because of limited availability please remove the list of videos from the main page i really dont want to see these video thumbnails half the videos look like chat roulette with random shirtless doods creeping in their bedroom terrible Bruh how do I remove it  WE DONT WANT THIS USELESS FEATURE WE WANT YOU TO STOP CENSORING ITS WHAT AARON WOULD HAVE WANTED I wish I didnt have to accept cookies now EDIT never had to before to use reddit services as they are calling basic browsing and commenting now Hi any word on Reddit deleting posts that shouldnt be deleted I know this is not the place to ask but you guys never answer Will not answer this either I guess Looks dumb as fuck Wish you guys would stop doing stupid shit like this and just fix the site Turn it off can you not trash up my feed I really enjoy this feature but if it were to become an actual feature there should be a way to access it other then it randomly appearing on top of your home page kone of the videos was a catand then fishand some dog at the beachreally reddit sighs adblocked the annoying unhideable red annoucement thing Not everyone cares really dont understand the point of thisjust displaying a bunch of random videos if i want that i can randomly view youtube videos thanks Just keep the fucking Reddit Nazis from broadcasting Nazi TV I scrolled through a bunch and I didnt see a single dick So if you hit tune in is it supposed to take you straight to a broadcast I push it and nothing happens Who else is headed to chan Fuck off I would love to broadcast How does one become a chosen one and gain this ability I dont think this feature is a bad idea but there are several issues I personaly experienced  We need to be able to fully hide it not only colapsed it  You really need to work on your communication Obviously Reddit is very touchy when it comes to changes You cant just roll out a new feature without proper communication before My initial reaction was to see it as another Facebook live or Instagram story and it looked stupid But once I went on rpan and read your marketing there I found the idea quite charming  You really need to get ride of the automatic upvoting I consider what I upvote or not as a very personnal choice and I really do not like to be forced Maybe this an issue only for me since I dont see other users complaining about it Finally to all the redditors complaining about the adds and the profit driven interest of Reddit You need to realise that you either pay with your money or with your time and attention If you do not want adds then pay premium I get that a lot of users do not want to condone the admins actions by paying money to them But you are already paying by supporting adds or by being an active users which make the platform attractive and add friendly If most active reddit users were paying for premium you would have a real say on the way reddit is run because you would be the money makers and not some add agency who doesnt give a crap about the platform english isnt my mother tongues so I might have made errors I really hate the idea of RPAN I dont go on reddit to see what redditors are up to I dont want this website to be the lawl look at my cat xD type thing that formerly people only memed about No thanks Unban some subs first This is the opposite of brilliant You guys pushing this personalitysocialmedia thing is soulless No one believes this temporary feature will remain that way if you make enough from it Youre going down the road of Facebook Get this garbage out of my notifications live streaming smart idea reddit has worked great for FB do I have to use truepic in order to post a picture Cause no one in the hong kong protest is going to do that in rpics either Why has reddit abandoned its prior commitments to freedom of speech And why is there no appropriate outlet for users to suggest policy changes or ask questions about policy  At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses opinions on how people use the reddit platform We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use      We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal      We stand for free speech This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it Not because thats the law in the United States  because as many people have pointed out privatelyowned forums are under no obligation to uphold it  but because we believe in that ideal independently and thats what we want to promote on our platform We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasnt clear and to be honest in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit Now its just reddit and we serve the community we serve the ideals of free speech and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse No porn videos yet rTIHI Ok I get it Can I please learn less about this feature If its good and people who are interested in that kinda thing use it then maybe people like me who arent interested will become interested Meanwhile the orange box on the top right of my screen makes me think I have a notification I care about and this post is next to two ads for it Four references on the home page is a bit much Five if you count the banner I dismissed Your link to RPAN takes us to redditcomrpan Is this all a joke I dont get it Im at a resort with laser shows and Gogo girls dancing half nakes on stage Thought nice to broadcast but cant broadcast because of al the pet streams to much traffic Sorry guys gonna enjoy it myself and have fun with the pet streams what in the world I cant see comments on broadcast I have a bad case of diarreah deleted Does the nsfw blocker keep the image from being requested until you click or does it block the image from display with it already downloaded Im just wondering for those who browse at work and would prefer to not be accidentally making requests for things that might be NSFW Just tried it It works I like it If you dont you can opt out I predict that this will be the least controversial announcement post ever Cool Main issue with it is that obviously links dont turn purple when you view the content on the comment page So then when you go back to reddit an hour later its not immediately apparent what content is new Not sure theres any good way around that but that alone will probably cause me to click on the links instead of viewing content in a comment page I WANTED TO BE ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING Sitewide spoiler tagging when Justhttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentspshhceosteveheretoanswermorequestionscwld gonna keephttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentshcredditinczfmhy asking  Why is there no sitewide spoiler tagging Almost every community that is concerned with spoilers has their own CSS hack to hide it but it doesnt work on mobile doesnt show up when you arent browsing from that sub and isnt terribly standardized Some subs have started using the NSFW tagging to hide spoiler thumbnails but that also has flaws because it still gets filtered as NSFW doesnt hide the title and cant be marked as both NSFW and spoilers other than manually through the post title  Please   Make spoiler tags sitewide   Allow users to showhide all spoiler posts like how you can showhide all NSFW posts   Allow individual subs to disallow spoiler posts I really do not like the way that the NSFW interstitial sets you to always show such images by default if you choose to click one Many subs often use NSFW to hide an image for spoiler or joke reasons I sometimes check the comments on such images to see if something is actually NSFW or not I think that this behavior poses the risk of getting people in trouble if they dont realize theyve just now told all NSFW images to load I would like preference to permanently disable this preview feature either for NSFW images or just entirely Or just to assume that I only want to see this one without permanently permitting them to show deleted By default if there is a preview for a link we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below Why is this default and not the other way round As someone who tries to look out for my bandwidth Id really appreciate it be the other way round especially for youtube and other video links But then again I have been dismissed by mods in a different bandwidth related topic who tell me its not reddits responsibility to look out for your bandwidth well sure I get that but once I run out of bandwidth I wont be clicking links or viewing ads any longer youd think someone who relies on clicks and ad views would want to save as much bandwidth for the user as possible I dunno seems kind of logical to me I also get I can set it to not auto loadfine Ill go check the box but I really shouldnt have to and what about all the folks who dont have the benefit of being a long time redditor who knows their way around I guess its not your responsibility to try to save their bandwidth either If you ask me thats a super fucked up attitude for the mods to take I hope opinions in admin land arent as uncaring and dismissive as the mods are about it and that the folks over in mod land change their attitude about it soon BTW  in my argument with the mods last month or so ago I finally took their advise and installed flashblockerand adblocker wile I was at I try run as few plugins as possible I have shitty computer and Im paying a gig to virgin to use this shitty computer to browse participate and add value your site Youre welcome And yes the computer is just that much slower now this is the shit I put up with just to be here itd be nice if you could make a few very small changes to try to same me and other poor smoes some bandwidth Just hire the guy who did RES already lol bring back the vote counters I dont like it I have already opened and closed the preview so when I go into the comments I dont need a picture or gif or whatever taking up the screen My only beef is that the new imgur preview window cuts off text image descriptionscaptionstitles once they exceed a certain short length To see the full text I have to click through to imgur to read it Before the media preview would show the full body of the textimage description no matter the length which is particularly important for browsing subs like rDIY or rfood that often have stepbystep guides or recipes with large amounts of text Is this related or do I need to aim my bitching at imgur or RES edit wait never mind Seems to have reverted to previous behavior Since RES has already been doing this for years they might have to start offering reddit gold features to continue to stay a step ahead How do we opt out Because autoopening videos and big pictures is one thing I hate about opening posts on the front page and it sounds like itd diminish traffic to the actual source Also Im sure some people would still like to not support that outbound links tracking reddit is apparently doing for the advertisers Edit Never mind its in preferences deleted Is there a limit to the size these previews are allowed to be Cause with all the different shapes and sizes images come in the text the only reason someone clicks for comments can get really REALLY pushed down the page and so much white space between the image and the right sidebar looks very tacky I understand your need to keep people inside of reddit for as long as possible but this seems rather tacked on and rough around the edges There is a reason so many people in the beta complained about it EDIT what Im talking about  httpimgurcomLWJmNEH Thats a p resolution and not a single comment is visible with the media preview Thank you for keeping the different expando buttons for videos and images That was my only gripe with the beta test tldr we just did stuff that RES already does The image used for NSFW interstitial really alters my perspective on whats unsafe for office consumption So you just implemented a small part of RES I guess thats great for nonRES users I thought everybody used RES I use reddit without logging in Id rather browse without using an account When I dont have an account I get these previews by default and I have no way to disable them Can you please not do this It makes the pages load slower and it doesnt help reddit at all I hate it Cool Err guys can we get one thing right  I dont want or need to see NSFW thumbs  but when I click expand  show it to me Now when I click Always show  NSFW thumbs are shown sometimes it funny shit from rImGoingToHellForThis sometimes its a pair of tits and I dont want tits showing in thumbs on the frontpage but I do want the when I click expand you gonna talk about the clickthrough link tracking What happened to the new icons that were used for the media preview buttons Now you just have to implement the dragtoresize functionality from RES and its perfect All I see is reddit chewing up my data plan by force opening images and movies I had just moved computers and was about to install RES now I dont need to Thats the primary function I missed Good work yall So basically what RES does Thats good Thanks for using my post in the TLDR pic lol This sucks ass I hate change I dont want nsfw thumbnails but i also want mediapreview not hidden How can i setup this Worthless feature I hate it Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages weve also added an optional screen to block NSFW media This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media The screen to block NSFW media should be default not optional Will save many an awkward moment So tldr all this so adds will auto play  u have garbtier developers The beta for this feature got horrendous feedback everyone disliked it What changes have you made since the beta to improve on it So thats why that did that Thats a godawful feature Ive noticed it on rwtf and it terrifies me What if somebody forgot to or didnt think to tag it NSFL Its not about being at work for me I dont want to click a benign title and see Annie getting decapitated by a lawnmower I really dont Was the prior system broken Can we opt out And data caps exhausted all over the place in a day Can we opt out entirely I like to stealth reddit while my kids are around and often even non NSFW gigs and pictures are not exactly appropriate RIP mobile data What about people who are lurking in incognito mode and dont want media preview because they have stuff like hoverzoom Damn it changed my NSFW settings and I was scrolling past someumsaucy images at school This is a really annoying feature I browse reddit not logged in more often than not so the optout isnt helpful Please make this an optin feature or I guess Im just gonna have to wait for RES to undo this nonsense deleted How can I turn this off completely I like to be able to resize and the one yall got doesnt hold a light to RES when it comes to that Great clicking that expand button was such hard work Wha A reddit announcement FUCK left my pitchfork at hom oh an improvement to the site Okay then Thanks I guess imgur works always fine but why not others too Why did I click the image preview of the image preview button Im just surprised upowerlanguage only had  unread messages in his inbox I like the clicking to look at nsfw stuff makes it a bit easier to look at in public edit ok i dont really like the picture automatically coming down when you go to comments I dont like it it ruins the back ground of the embeded images expansion when it is multi image imgur post for example Looks shitty I have a dark theme because my eyes water at night from bright monitor and this bright embeded imgur background is shit Not liking it It blows the content within the posts down Also  only autoshowing when Ive already clicked through to view the image separately so probably a browser issue beta testing is useful sometimes I was all ready to complain but the fact you made it easy to optout under preferences I am happy good job user banned NSFW interstitial Tell me more about this How does this work Where is the setting to put on this blurfilter Is it thishttpiimgurcomGVIRpng or a different one  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content autoexpanding will save many users a click I specifically like having all images collapsed by default  I guess a loser is me I cant see how this could possibly go wrong Found that hot NSFW picture httpiimgurcombwAFodxjpg Do we get to resize the media or is that only for RES I turned on autoexpand and went to rnsfw to test the new settings I do not get the interstitial for any link in that subreddit I also note that the subreddit itself shows thumbnails Neither of these are affected by my settings I temporarily subscribed and found they do not show on the front page But following a link from the main page to a link in a NSFW subreddit still shows the expanded content without the interstitial Only if the subreddit is not NSFW does the interstitial show I do not like this If you want to not show the interstitial if youre on a NSFW subreddit that makes some sense But behavior should be consistent from the main page How can I disable this without being logged in Thank you for making it an option I can disable I dont want media previews on the comments pages Great that I can turn it off So many website developers make these changes and then dont give you the option to go back Its refreshing to see Ill just comment on this NSFW picture at work without opening itoh fuck Yay more stuff for me to turn off Reddit sucks Thanks for letting us turn it off if we want to My first experience with this unexpected new functionality was to see a penguin shoot half a liter of projectile shit directly into the eye of another penguin Let us say that I am not a fan of this update I cant see upowerlanguage and not think of thebutton Thank you for providing an option to disable the autoexpand With my current settings displaying  links at once the page for many subs would be unbearably busy and huge not to mention incredibly heavy for my browser to load I dont like the autoexpanding when you open a thread but Im glad you guys added the option to opt out of it Any chance there can be work on different NSFW markers Maybe have the NSFW tags colour coded to show what exactly is offensive Porn is completely different than a piece of art with some nudity yet they are treated the same Same goes with straight up gore versus wartime photos or say another painting The only problem Im seeing is if the gif makes my browser really laggy when Im just trying to comment I only expect lag when viewing the gif not when commenting Is there a way to turn this feature off if unwanted by the user No Spoiler tags Ok I like the change so far Im a common user who doesnt fiddle much with the settings but I like clicking a link to a video and seeing the video within the OPs post like on rvideos Its sweet This is amazing You guys and gals really should have used a warning banner to let people know this was happening so that we could disable it before running into it Hoo boy are people going to exploit this The blurring doesnt seem to work for me My preferences look like thishttpimgurcomSqit but if I open an NSFW pages comments get the unblurred image I have RES What am I doing wrong I ticked the hide nsfw images but they arent blurred when I click on the comments am I misunderstood or just doing something wrong Id disable it but I do like the feature just not for nsfw content Thanks Sowhats the follow up to the button Honest I dont like the change it brings back functionality I hated within RES Autoplaying GFYgifvvideoaudio in general was something I hated back when TIFU had those guys that would narrate stories Its annoying If I want to see the image or gif or what have you Ill open it myself I like to open several tabs at once and if theyre all images or gifs or videos its a waste to have them all automatically opened quick edit At least theres an optout option unlike most other revolutionary changes that get churned out How do I permanently disable this and the NSFW blocking auto expanding pics and gifs is one thing videos  sound  dumb especially if you go through and open multiple tabs first and then go through them one by one for that i have to turn this off Thank you I always found auto expand very annoying glad I can turn it off now Can I disable this Work blocks the embedded frames so I get a giant AH AH AH You cant do that on every comments section now So fucking annoying I had to disable it  DELETED Now Im torn between media preview and hoverzoom Grrrrr And I hate it and the function to shut it off isnt working for me Always good when they add new features Even if they have been largely widely available via addons But what about SRS Thank you for the option to turn this off When is the transparency report coming out about all the LE warrants and subpenas reddit turns over  Will this affect the incomes of YouTubers who rely on views and likes to earn money If I watch their video in reddits window did I just screw that YouTuber or does the view transfer Hey its the button guy This update is fucking annoying I hope it will help with this years April fools We need one as a community IMHO Cool Nice upgrade Thanks for the hard work Works great Thank You I thought something changed I wondered what I had hit and was looking for a way to turn it off Easy questions answered none of the hard ones answered Just like an actual AMA Nice Is there any reason that you are publishing an abridged version of the takedown notice rather than the full text of the takedown notice with personally identifiable information removed that you received Something like httpsgithubcomgithubdmca would be awesome Are you going to keep secretly censoring people As seen

rChillingEffectshttpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsvredditchangepublicdisplayofcontentremoved If they are optional how are fake removals to be distinguished so people arent impersonating reddit and causing drama What about moderation transparency Will this ever get released httpwwwredditcomrmodnewscommentsovrtmoderatorsfeedbackrequestedonenablingpublic Some of us moderators want to be transparent about removals as well Question In pursuance of  US Code    Limitations on liability relating to material online g paragraph   Do you intend to  plan to  have a policy to replace material that was taken down pursuant to a DMCA takedown notice not less than  days and not more than  days after receiving a counternotice and absent notice from the takedown issuer that they are seeking a court order to restrain the counternotice issuer from posting allegedly infringing material  if you receive a DMCA counternotice from the person whose posting was taken down Relevant language from cited legislation  C replaces the removed material and ceases disabling access to it not less than  nor more than  business days following receipt of the counter notice unless its designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the notification under subsection cC that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the service providers system or network  TLDR if someone files a takedown notice on something we post and we counternotice and they do nothing to follow up do we get our postings back Oh transparency huh Thats why youre mysteriously shadowbanning people left and right A weird draconian process with no explanations whatsoever that can descend on anybody at anytime How about you deal with that shit first and then maybe Ill take a shot at believing this company line Until then youve got a long fucking way to go before anybody reasonable believes you EDIT Please dont gold this comment Send the money to somebody who needs it So youre sucking your own dick and patting yourselves on the back for it deleted Can your CEO do an AMA I think everyone has some good questions for her What about all the stuff being removed about the new Reddit CEO I bet this looks like a fucking joke now bring back the vote counters Remember this posts What was transparent about the decision made today So are you afraid to fire Ellen Pao because shell file a frivolous lawsuit against the company if you do And today you took yet another step backwards How about some transparency in all your little cliques and cabals admins who go around shadow banning people they disagree with banning subreddits you disagree with creating new global rules just to suppress the operations of specific subreddits while not applying said rules consistently across all subreddits etc How does one know they are shadow banned Nice corporate masturbation material Just  takedowns Man I thought this was an important message I though this was going to be the good kind of transparency not the cover your ass against lawyers kind Waste of my  sec clicking and skimming this shit Soooo Victoria is where  I cant find one comment supporting this announcement yet it has  upvotes Can someone please explain this wizardry to me Stop talking bullshit for your investors Reddit is going downhill let people enjoy what they can Stop patting your own back while the entire community is laughing on you Jesus Christ All the things on Reddit that could use some additional transparency and you go with this Fix mods on rleagueoflegends What an absolute joke So hows this Transparency thing working out for you Judging by the length of time its taking to get a response Im betting youre just trying to figure out the best way to be Transparent in your next announcement without actually admitting that you fucked up Or does this facade only apply to removal of content This thread sure didnt go how you wanted it to huh I cant even find a single positive comment There is absolutely no way this thread was voted to  by the users Get rid of Pao bring back the vote counter and stop selling ruleimmune accounts to corporate interests Such transparency much impresss You failed us About as transparent as the tppa Fucking hated the sick nature of rfatpeoplehate  but its the type of shit that kept reddit better than the rest The freedom of reddit shame RIP Reddit Soon to be rgag You still shadow ban without notice pretty transparent guys Transparency How about explaining your ever expanding use of censorship and banning with no justifications How about demanding Mods must justify their censorship and banning and that censorship criteria based on the opinion of mods be stopped How about having a tolerance policy for supposed offensive and unpopular speech Reddit you are already on the glide slope to irrelevance because of your censorship based on bias and political correctness BTW I am now moved to VOATCO Join me there and breath the fresh air of freedom Looking at the comments and whats been upvoted it becomes clear to me that there is a problem uweffey it seems that Reddit has lost the enthusiastic trust and reflexive support of its community How do you plan to address this TRANSPARENCYhttpimgurcomDIYANr How Reddit works Reads like a joke now Bu what about Victoria wheres the info on this  Transparency is important to us deleted deleted deleted deleted The true censorship on Reddit is done through usual mod tools such as  of threads discussing Ellen Pao Transparency is important to us HAHAHAHAHAHAHA best reddit joke ever kk thx bye Can you give another example by removing my comment I know the Colonels secret herbs and spices if that helps Oh the fucking Irony Edit Hey you guys almost got me out of the negative comment karma I was in for having an opinion in the survivor game show subreddit Nice Transparency would be better if the shadowbanning stops Its not a tool against spammers anymore but a way to silence bad users Ellen Pao goes to Home Depot to hire migrant workers to go home with her and choke her in the shower What A PR DISASTER WHAT WERE YOU PEOPLE THINKING Go back to your meeting notes find the person who suggested selectively banning subreddits based on personal politics and fire them immediately for incompetence  How frequently do you get the takedown requests  How long between the time you get the request and the time its removed  What action do you take against the person who posted the offending pic  link  whatever Great announcement Admns Really went over like a fart in church Well this went over well it looks like youve taken  step forward only to take  steps backwards Buddy Fletcher husband of Reddit CEO Ellen Pao is being described as being the operator of Ponzi scheme  million dollars of a pension fund was lost Ellen Pao is now accused of frivolous lawsuits to try and stay afloat and some other shit Seeing as she is a CEO of a large company and has a fraudster for a husband I think its safe to say we have a textbook ASPDSociopath on our hands This comment has been overwritten by a script as I have abandoned my Reddit account and moved to voatcohttpsvoatco If you would like to do the same install

scripthttpsgreasyforkorgenscriptsredditoverwrite If you are using Internet Explorer you should probably stay here on Reddit where it is safe Then simply click on your username at the top right of Reddit click on comments and hit the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot Was expecting an end to shadow bans from title At least notify people of why with a reason Fuck you Chairman Pao Is this because GamerGate exposed how much of a sleezeball Ellen Pao is You are all an embarressment to the memory of Aaron Schwartz Why dont you take a stance on mods with commercial interests For instance one of the mods of rBitcoin openly works for a company that is frequently featured in news stories and routinely deletes content that is critical of said company Its not sufficient for your company to be transparent you have to make sure that you create a safe open and transparent environment for discussion         What a joke Hows hrs with no official announcement transparent This is misdirection This is a very standard confidence man trick They are claiming that content will not be magically removed in some way that there is now a trustworthy transparent indicator of when something happened and thus magic does not exist Everyone will believe this Then when content still magically appears a trap can be deployed Well this doesnt have the trusted verified stamp on it that any removed content would have therefore nothing out of the ordinary is going wrong I understand exactly why reddit is doing this It is just another form of control Positive control versus negative control Reddit is now a conman or conperson to be more gender neutral deleted If reddit is so transparent than how could I be banned from rAskReddit where I had close to  karma for a comment I made in rwritingprompts where I am not banned Modding more than one sub needs to stop It leads to meglomaniac behavior from ego driven people full of their own self importance Can you change the wording to say reddit admins have removed the stuff instead of reddit I think itd be a little more clear as to whos doing it because although saying reddit is perfectly accurate in the sense of reddit the company it doesnt really make sense in terms of reddit the website itself Just one word for clarification would be nice thanks Fuck you ellen pao zedong LOL go fuck yourselves  You already killed your website by fucking with users so badly over the last yearhttpimgurcomLejWZYn You are corporategovernmentcontrol whores and you should be ashamed of yourselves The day of rope is coming and it wont be kind to people like you  Transparency is important to us and thats why we made all of reddits UI see though You can now browse reddit while also looking at your desktop Neat Can we please view the upvotedownvote totals again please HAHAHAHHAHA TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT CLASSIC REDDIT Hi admins I just wanted to point out that basically all of the comments here are calling you hypocritical jackanapes Have a nice day Loving the transparency guys nah jk you admins can eat a bag of dicks If you cared about transparency shadow bans wouldnt be a thing Does this mean you are going to now be transparent about when you accept money in exchange for allowing a post to exist For example all of the IAMA which are  advertising for some upcoming movie Also are you going to be fully transparent on all financial transactions Reddit undergoes which have anything to do with data mining usage patterns of Reddit users as well as content from Reddit users  Removed by reddit on account of alleged copyright or trademark infringement Read the full takedown notice herehttpikymcdncomentriesiconsoriginalSanicHegehogpng  Dear Reddit Administrators andor Moderators Nobody is buying any of your bullshit damage control Sincerely the Reddit community Admins getting absolutely fucked in the comments I love it uweffey what impact do you think this will have on future crisis moments on reddit violentacrez boston bomber the fappening etc where decisions have to made quickly decisively and under pressure Edit decisiondecisions So as long as theyre being transparent and this is a great move maybe they should stop issuing shadowbans for reasons other than spam At least that way a user could see why they were banned and by whom HAHAHAHAHABABHAHABA So are you guys going to release any kind of statement regarding what happened then Please dont espouse one thing transparency then totally disregard it and even eschew it Whats been happening the last few months has been totally deplorable Dont masquerade censorship as responsibility Tell the community exactly what happened Until then there will be not trust between the community the moderators and the executive operators of Reddit If you really cared about transparency youd end the process of shadowbanning users IMMEDIATELY I am just wondering when you are going to remove Ellen Pao deleted Meh Why remove noncopyright content in the first place Reddits lack of free speech has made me turn away from it as a community as a whole Its a parody of its once famous self Simply put Comments and content on a website like this are categorised as a forum Peoples opinions in the open air for everyone to see consider and then react upon Be it acclaim indifference or condemnation Removing threads and comments is not akin to an editor in print journalism and reddit should not take any stance on its content at all period It is the forum and not the mediator of a debate This website is not print journalism and the views expressed here should always remain unedited and accessible to all Removing content is advocating the removal of people to think as they please I may find your views abominable but I will defend your right to express them Censorship is always tied to someones idea of morality and morality as we know is biased at best and physically dangerous et al Finally youll also find that the ones who censor content do so because they are unable to deal with it They will either reject an idea or obsess over it Rejecting an idea is fine except its also a rejection of who we are as humans and doing so means we cannot learn as a whole and grow Obsession implies some form of guilt at finding an unwholesome idea some how appealing and in hoping to remove all the naughty words from the dictionary you reveal who you truly are The one who desires to know them in the first place Both denying others to do so and harbouring an unhealthy approach to dealing with your own humanity Ill also add removing comments is not just censorship youre destroying the very idea of a forum The walls the roof the seating of the auditorium gone and meaningless Its people within merely puppets of a moderator Their expression dead Tyranny in disguise We the tyrannous Although I am certainly not a fan of hating people based upon their weight I think that takedowns of subs should show transparency like what was promised here I dont mind if you remove hateful content as long as you substantiate the takedown with an explanation for the action taken Perhaps you could implement a cease and decease style system to give the mods of a sub one last chance to fix their sub as proposed herehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsbpamremovingharassingsubredditscskrr Most of the damage was done during the high tide of GG leaked skype logs and such from mods Ill raise my voice as yet another person who vehemently opposes this feature It is my opinion that this initiative muddles the very value proposition that differentiates Reddit from many other profilepersona centric companies such as Tumblr Facebook Twitter and Snapchat Reddit is incredibly unique in the fact that it values the communitysubreddit by asking its members to be upstanding community members and even more incredibly by having a time honored tradition of forcing everyone to obey the same rules as the average user so even great people like Bill Gates and Barack Obama cant just force their way to the top of Reddit Rewarding users to submit content on their own profile subverts much of what the Reddit community stands for just visiting the Reddiquettehttpswwwredditcomwikireddiquette rules alone makes it clear how many site wide rules are subverted by allowing users to advertise their own profiles for karma And regarding user discoverability what makes the current user discovery experience on Reddit today compelling is that you discover users based on common communities and topics of your choosing Enabling users to escape the community paradigm means that the most popular users and power users are going to engage in a race to the bottom to gain attention you can see this evidence by the fact that so many content creators on Snapchat Youtube Instagram and others often love posting interpersonal drama with other sameplatform personalities or will stop producing content that theyre known for to take a second to jump on whatever new popular bandwagon is happening at the time for more clicks and views This is all signaltonoise degradation I sincerely hope that Reddit does not lose itself to being lumped into the same mindspace as other profilebased social platforms because I question Reddits standings if it chooses to label itself as a competitor in such an already saturated field This very feature threatens to do that Please reconsider something that clearly goes against Reddits mission sic to help people discover places where they can be their true selves and empower our community to flourish httpsaboutredditcomhttpsaboutredditcom Your own site boldly states The conversation starts on Reddit The conversation not the concert or the lecture or the speech or interview starts on Reddit I ask that you choose to keep it that way Looking at the current example profiles this seems like its going to lead to brigading So say Knthing has k followers on his profile  he posts to aww and all his followers then see he has posted go to aww and upvote him How is this going to be addressed as it seems like its going to lead to popular users having a massive advantage on communities where they post They get two bites of the cherry for their content to be noticed  nothing they put out will ever be overlooked It creates a two tier level of users it seems  EDIT  so knthing actually DID have a post on raww from  month ago which was sitting at  when I looked an hour ago Now it is over  upvotes so people are going to his profile seeing other posts and then going and upvoting them What this means is that users who make a popular post can do something like add in a link to their profile drive people there and get their other posts upvoted too This not only changes the way that reddit works it makes brigading a core part of the reddit experience I really dont like this idea I come to reddit because its different because its about the community rather than the individual If I wanted to participate in a site centered around status updates and profile pages I would go to Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or Tumblr or even Snapchat I like the idea of freshening up the user pages but I dont think that content should be posted exclusively there Theres a sitewide rule against selfpromotion which I know you said doesnt apply to the userpages but thats all this is a way to circumvent the selfpromotion rule Look what Ive posted to my page everybody come look at my page give me pageviews Part of the charm of reddit is finding a gem of a user in a subreddit especially in the small ones Now rather than them engaging in the communities especially ones built up around them HPC HH etc theyre just going to post to their own userpages because its just easier Count me as a vote against this This kind of feature will end up destroying subreddits Why would a company celebrity etc use a subreddit or a community as you keep calling them to post updates do an AMA or whatever when they could just use their profile This is just going to fracture subreddits that cover wider topics and decrease the conversation into something more targeted Whole thing just feels antireddit This seems to chiefly accomplish two things  Removes power from subreddits and their mods and gives it directly to brands something Reddit has been trying to underhandedly do for a long time  Confuse and muddy the waters between a user and a community uleagueoflegends is not a user in any sense of the word Facebook eventually realized that having brands pretend to be people is stupid and built Pages specifically to counteract this problem Learn from their mistake dont repeat it Both of these things Im generally opposed to This change seems unnecessary and unwanted Its fairly disappointing development time was spent on this and not the huge backlog of needed fixes to the site I came to reddit to escape hell Facebook and found a sprawling mansion here for myself Just as I was settling in Reddit bulldozes it and puts up a shitty FacebookMartwhatever I dont like this I wanted all of us to be anonymous to be different and fucking faraway from the douches that scour and scavenge on Facebook Instagram and Twitter Except for in AMAs I dont care if the person whose post I am commenting on is Bill Gates or Osama Bin Laden I dont have a personal respect for any single one redditor I have a common respect for all of us There is a reason we all are here on Reddit and not with the girls that are selling protein powder on Instagram to make a living TLDR reddit is Facebook now deleted Im a content creator who does a bunch with some Reddit communities and this change has me concerned Ive done well because Ive interacted with my communities This change doesnt look like it will help build communities PLEASE dont do this The moment things can be posted to user pages companies will move in and try to amass huge followings on their user pages Well have businesses begging people to follow their pages The subreddits will atrophy The frontpage or its new equivalent will be rampant company promotions Love LL Bean Be sure to follow our user page Want more Star Wars updates be sure to follow Disney Reddit as we know it would cease to exist The soul ie the communities ie content upvoted based on true interest and not brandpower would be gone Not to mention youd be appealing to everyones own narcissistic streak Everyone would try to build their own personal brand telling all of their friends to follow their reddit page begging for more followers on posts etc The concept of having a relatively anonymous user page would fade away The worst part is implementing this idea in any fashion is opening pandoras box There would be no stopping it even if you offer an optout option even if you offer an optin option It would not take much to start a feedback cycle that fundamentally changes reddit If you think people will just put up with this youre mistaken theyll leave Direct from the reddiquettehttpswwwredditcomwikireddiquette Do not moderate a story based on your opinion of its source Quality of content is more important than who created it Edit Fixed quote Why  Seriously why This is a great example of feature creephttpsenwikipediaorgwikiFeaturecreep Please be wary of the unintended consequences Theres a tendency for optional features to become de facto required features over time Case in point Reddit was created with only username and passwords Then recovery emails were added as an option But some users hold others to a standard of having a verified email address This comes up in comment sections from time to time user for one month no verified email you must be an astroturfing shill Soon not having a profile and I do mean that as a profile in the Facebook sense of the word will be a strike against a user in some subreddits Perhaps AutoModerator will delete their comments Reddit has also seen a huge drop in quality over the past month or so since the frontage algorithm changed Half of the frontpage is memes And really terrible memes like brain memes and prequel memes which are copypastes of The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis Plus theres all the softcore porn like rgentlemanboners Yes you can make an account and git rid of all that garbage but a good portion of the sites visitors do not log in Emojis are starting to show up in submission titles So now we have a dumbeddown front page and Facebook profiles Whats next Log in with Facebook credentials Yeh I really dont like this That was my initial impression and I came in here to read more because often I come around to the admins ideas like the affiliate linking one But no I still think this is a bad idea I think if anything this will discourage content creation by crowding out the average redditor in favour of power users Users with recognition already get large boosts to their posts by being known in their subreddit communities and this goes on to give them an initial momentum site wide I already think this pendulum has swung too far in this direction and away from individuals submissions I think this will effectively strangle competition by raising barriers to entry via a form of intellectual property branding I think this has lead to problems on youtube and will cause even more problems for reddit which by its nature has a much broader scope Furthermore I see this as a step away from anonymity Many of the currently most influential users have less anonymity than regular users and many are known by their real names and faces This is something paralleled by youtube where as youtube became more commercialised and promoted high view channels at the expense of more niche channels and as old media organisations opened large channels on youtube people became more and more linked to their real world identities Even those that had aimed to keep a hard seperation between their private lives and their channel When I first came to reddit I used my real name influenced by the rise of facebook and twitter I had thought that the time of not giving out your name on the internet was gone But like most redditors I have come to realise that there is a big benefit and a relief from being able to interact anonymously with others online Especially in an age of massive data surveillance mining and retention I think it is important to have somewhere online to come and discuss issues freely without having to worry about mispeaking or later changing your mind I have moved almost all of my online political debate and discussion which I think is an important part of any democratic society especially for young people from facebook to reddit for this reason The best way to get the correct answer is to post the wrong answer on the internet Or in Silicon Valley parlence fail quickly I dont want to feel like I cant be wrong or cant fail online Im sorry but this reminds me too much of what Yik Yak did last summer For those who werent aware Yik Yak is an app where people can anonymously post small messages that anyone else around the same physical location can see and comment on also anonymously though if the original poster comments on their own post the comment is distinguished Last March they added Handles usernames that would optionally show next to your post In July they added profiles which would show a karma number as well as a picture And lastly in August they took away the option to not have your handle be displayed on a post or comment claiming they were shifting their focus from anonymity to discovery of people in their local community Predictably the app turned into a ghost town within days By time they rolled back the changes a few months later it was too late to bring everyone back While this change to Reddit doesnt have the obvious issues that changing an anonymous platform to a pseudonymous one does it does share one major thing in common with Yik Yaks changes and thats that it represents a shift in the sites focus from discovering communities to discovering users Reddit was originally made to be and has traditionally been a newslink aggregator as well as a discussion forum collection  both of which are services with a very light focus on discovery of other users if any at all People come to Reddit to discover content and entire communities not to be confused with the people in said communities centered around their favorite topics To switch to a profilebased system or even hint at doing so is to desire to compete with Facebook and Twitter when your service is really nothing like either to begin with Facebook works because people who know each other already use the service  when a typical Facebook user discovers another user on Facebook they usually discover that the person who they already know has an account not that they exist On Twitter its the same though there seems to be a bigger focus on content from brands and in that way there may be some discovery of users but usually those are brands and artists rather than typical users I can really only see this going three ways and they are  the most likely and best for Reddit as a whole Reddit continues as usual except power users and writers also have profiles to boost their own content on  Reddit becomes overrun by brands in a Twitteresque fashion or similarly to if Facebook only had Pages or  possibly as a logical conclusion after  Reddit users form a mass exodus find andor create another site to be the de facto link aggregation service All of these are missing any concept of ordinary users going out of their way to make profiles or discover other ordinary users they dont already know somewhere else That concept  of user discovery  has been tried over and over again and has mostly flopped outside of meetupbased communities which are inherently limited by locality and by interest profile and Facebook Groups pretty much has a monopoly on this right now Overall I think this is a change that should be approached with caution if its even fully implemented at all I think that this is a bad idea This makes reddit too much like a generic social media site I also think it is kind of dragging content away from subreddits and onto profiles for no reason Youre saying that this is more for users to post their own opinions but that can be done on a subreddit and even if it cant the user could just make on themselves What makes reddit different is that its more about the content than the person This feature promotes the kind of Facebooklike features that people on reddit hate Even the design of the page isnt like reddit at all The whole thing is like a social media page The huge header image the profile picture the blurb thing posting directly to your page etc In fact the reddit profile pages look remarkably similar to twitterhttpimgurcomaDStU Also about the pseudoanonymity thing it isnt really just about people not knowing who you are irl On reddit people generally are going to read something and not know or care who wrote it for most cases anyways Even if your profile on a site doesnt have your real name people can still know you by the profile I think this feature is kind of turning reddit into what is basically Facebook without your real name on it and thats not what reddit is about Reddit so good because you can make a post on any subreddit you want and if its a quality post it can get noticed no matter who made it Reddit is supposed to form communities and discuss things anonymously online This is separating people into their own little treehouses that seemingly act like subreddits but with only one moderator This feature is pointless and will only serve to diminish the good things about reddit Reddit isnt about profiles its about subreddits communities discussions etc Having user profiles doesnt work towards any of that Its more like a self centered type of thing common with other social media sites Having a subreddit dedicated to just you or your company means that you will decide what discussion takes place here One draw of reddit is that companies and people cant control how the discussion takes place Now if I say had some product that was controversial I could just moderate my profile page which I would use as basically a subreddit to only allow positive feedback I guess Ill also comment on the design of the page in general The header is too big the posts should be more off to the side the page takes too long to load and the whole thing looks more like the mobile site for some reason I guess if youre trying to make them look more similar that could make sense but it looks weird in comparison to the rest of the site User pages were fine before They were simple provided little information about the user and more about their posts and other necessary information Im pretty concerned this update could mark a shift towards users who use their own personal userpageusersubreddit to post shit about them that belongs on Facebook twitter etc The thing that makes reddit special is that it isnt like other social media sites The focus is placed on the content discussion and community because of the absence on features found on more tradition social media sites Sometimes less is more Please dont ruin that LETS GET SOCIAAAAAL on a platform where content is the only thing that matters and people want to stay anonymous I do not like this idea When I found Reddit two years ago I fell in love with it because it did NOT promote celebrity status of users Users had to work for that and even then they were still just users providing content alongside everyother user providing content To me Reddit is about the subreddits about communities making content and not about a few individuals making content This change will shift reddit to a platform people already dislike Look at what is happening with Youtube Youtube decided to switch to supporting major platforms and it feels less casual because of that I dont want Reddit to shift over to that as well I am a Redditor because i enjoy content the collective aggregation by the whole community The focus isnt the creators the power to get customized aggregated content based on the points of interest of the user is the USP Im going to leave Reddit as soon as you guys roll out this new feature I am currently not on Facebook Instagram and Quora precisely because they follow this structure of social media I barely tolerate Twitter as atleast there is anonymity there This profile based content is useless tbh I do not want to subscribe to everything a person is doing Lets say Redditor X is a good at photoshop skills which i enjoy on the photoshop subreddit but X also creates content for another subreddit for example bodybuilding or skincare none of which Im interested in Thats why i dont subscribe to those subs but due to this profile following Im going to have to wade through everything that X posts on hisher profile while i dont get the content from other lesser known photoshop enthusiasts because the subreddit would be dead Do you see the problem Please do not do this Let me enjoy Reddit Let it remain the goddamn FRONT PAGE OF THE INTERNET This is going to pull people both the individual posters whether theyre a company or a Youtuber or a random person who makes a thing that catches on and the subreddit general users into the profile posts And out of the subreddits Why would a game company a creator a whoever who has a thing thats gaining traction want to post in a mere subreddit when they can focus all their posts on their profile page Where they have mod control by default Where they can tune and shape what theyre doing What happens to various game subreddits when the developers from small wannabe indies all the way up to triple A devs and dev employees stop posting in the subs and post only to their own profile What happens to new and upcoming creators like binging with babbish or sovietwomble when they stop posting in threads about their vids and only post on their profiles Or when they only venture away from their profiles to link back to it Why would I talk about starcraft in rstarcraft when I can talk about it on ublizzard and know they might be watching Because its their channel That destroys rrts rgaming and so on The examples continue in the same fashion This changes Reddit fundamentally It turns it into a clone of something its not It removes what makes Reddit interesting and engaging the collective gestalt of all the users rising and falling based on how they want things to go One of the default rules of Reddit is participate dont promote How does profile centric posting help that And I say all this as a content creator If you guys push this change through Ill use it for whatever its worth While it lasts But me and a lot of other people will be looking for the next thing Making this change go live and wide sets a ticking clock on Reddits destruction The community is what makes Reddit work Not power users and certainly not companies showing up to big foot and massage and control their messages they way they do everywhere else in life Fuck this idea  When I say this Im not exaggerating I literally almost entirely stopped using every other social platform and instead started using Reddit I absolutely love that there isnt this stupid petty and MOST IMPORTANTLY this desperate need of selfpromotion and narcissism What is the point of subreddits if content can be posted right to users pages WHO IS ASKING for Reddit to be another Facebooktype place which is exactly what this implementation feels like Like honestly  who even asked for this I havent heard of anyone asking for this I come to Reddit to get AWAY from traditional social media sites and to JUST see content straight up content and interact with people I dont come here to follow people and Ive never once had the desire to follow any particular person to keep tabs on their posts I have become familiar with which users whose content I like post where There is no need for this shitty update Stop trying to make Reddit another crappy social media site there are already a million Believe it or not there are a vast amount of people here who come here because of the things Reddit is NOT like people come here because its simple its unique and it ISNT another god damned Facebook I pray this stupid shit doesnt actually kick in Let it be known that I know no one has to share my opinion And I may be overreacting But I a world full of narcissism and disgusting and INCESSANT selfpromotion it is so fucking nice to get away from it when it comes to being on the internet Im not always on Reddit but when I am I would like it to be enjoyable Dont implement this shit Dont Why are you trying to turn Reddit into a social media clone I didnt get an answer yesterday but I really want to know Edit  uHideHideHidden uspez uknthing I really hope you guys are taking this feedback seriously Dont just look at the number of upvotes on this announcement and decide its good to go As it stands right now its at a  approval rating from the community and its been dropping fast Last time I checked on this thread about  hours ago you guys were around  upvote and about  hours ago it was in the s This started out as a controversial idea and as this has progressed the proportion of people who have upvoted this announcement has steadily dropped lower Not to mention that the top comments in this thread are all about how this will either be bad or how actual Reddit users dont want this Note that they are the highest comments in this thread These are the sentiments that your own users agree with the most And collectively they have already obtained at least  gildings only looking at the top  top level replies not accounting for any gildings that may have happened in those threads all about how people do not want this to come to Reddit Im begging you guys to reconsider this heavily This is not what your users want A lot of us are feeling a bit betrayed and you havent given us a good reason as to why you went this route You have several times now cited the difficulty in creating a personal subreddit to do exactly what you claim these user pages are for so if that is one of the true focuses here why did you not simply make that process easier Reddit users your users are not happy about this change and we do not want it to come to Reddit We are rightfully so scared of the implications that such a change will bring later on i dont know what i expected but this is drastically different than what i expected The only reason I have a reddit account is because it had none of this profile page nonsense its a major reason I deleted my other social media accounts People start becoming too selfcentered and the purpose of reddit will shift from a fun community into content whoring and a lot more sponsoring and so on that turned YouTube into what it is today I like reddit because the focus isnt the people its the topic at hand With this change the dynamic will definitely shift to what other social media sites have become Initially itll be viewed as a popular change by the admins which will encourage more changes to come resulting in the focus of threaded discussions declining more and more over time Think carefully for the longterm future of reddit not the shortterm Edit also look how broken it looks in desktop mode on mobile devices It doesnt even come close to the consistency reddit has Whats the valueadvantage of this as opposed to the preexisting format of content creators posting their work in relevant subreddits I thought the whole point of Reddit was to have communities where people who have similar interests can share their workthoughtswhatever My questions were left unanswered yesterday so lets try again How will you counteract SEO spamhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpamdexing Will you counteract SEO spam posted on users profiles at all How will I be able to get spam and prohibited content off this site especially if its timesensitive Since were sidestepping automod rules and human moderation here there does not seem to be an adequate solution to this Your answers boil down to let upvotes decide and spammers wont get many subs anyway but we all know that this is not how this works How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name Will personal posts be included in the redditwide search please no Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts ie will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages only subreddit posts I wonder if this will change the dynamic of the site honestly one of the reasons I like reddit so much is because its so slow to change I like that down to the visual qualities Reddit is still pretty similar to when I signed on  years ago I still disable reddit mobile on my phone when I browse on mobile Is that the digitalage old users are resistant to change philosophy sure but theres a concrete reason why I use this site in the first place and I cant be the only one here who doesnt like the terms for engagement swapped out once I get comfortable This is one of the few places online I feel somewhat anonymous even if my profile is easily doxable because the format isnt framed around individuals but rather what people post I rarely feel a need to look at someones profile and why would I I dont come to reddit for the users but for the grand collage of what the users provide Third content creators like advertisers Yeah we have some celebrities people who spend all day posting but isnt half of reddit reposted content anyway How many contentcreators either dont have their own subreddits or profiles on other websites Is this to counteract Reddit itself being farmed for clickbait Will we be able to keep the old profile should we prefer it I suppose well see It looks like a facebook profile Heres how itll work Open rall sees gif that was funny goes to USER page in lieu of subreddit because THAT user was the funny one fuck the rest of the sub That guy is funny FOLLOWED Back to rall scroll on insert death of subs here Not to mention the inevitable elevation of reddit celebrities You liked user x others also liked user Y or Recommended Reddit content creator  X bullshit in feeds Yeah this is pretty crappy Large companiesentities will no longer post or interact in independent subreddits Theyll go where its safe where they have total moderation control and no accountability A huge amount of what makes reddit a worthwhile community is the fact that people are on an even playing field and independent volunteer moderators help to keep things that way I hope this isnt the case but it does seem like you guys reddit the company are trying to shift control away from the moderators There have been a number of embarrassing highprofile incidents lately of moderators of large subreddits disagreeing with the adminscompany and causing trouble for you It seems like you either A No longer remember what made reddit a place people care to spend time or B Know but youre giving in to business pressures to monetize by taking away those pesky moderators who keep messing things up Either way its crappy and youre going to lose a lot of users There isnt a reasonable alternative to reddit now but there will be As someone posted in rmodnews yesterday Im afraid this will discourage posting to subreddits and could hurt communities Im also worried that this change will ultimately only really help the more famous redditors while the majority will either never use this feature or will never get to use this feature It seems to me there needs to be more emphasis on the friends feature reddit has had for years if this is the direction were going So where do we flee Whats the new site I came here when digg shat the bed and it seems like Reddit is finally doing the same I dont like facebook dont even have a twitter account Why would I want more of them Im ready for an exodus just someone let me know what the alternative is If I follow uspez does it also notify me when he changes peoples comments  I do have a few problems What if we dont want to be followed by people What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones I personally do not like the profile page as it feels weird Like it is a forum or Facebook profile page I am fine chatting with other strangers without knowing where they are active in other subreddits or the choice of following them I dont like to keep it personal as I like reddit as a more of a community based site Also even if we can make certain things private or make our profile private there will be subreddits that will require you to have a public profile to participate in the sub Reddit is great because its NOT social media this sounds like it is making Reddit more like social media No thanks  Were taking feedback on this experience on rbeta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddits existing communities which is why were partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out youre not you really are not engaging or caring about your users here no one wants this theres a ton of other things you can be doing besides this This is just a prelude to a native advertising play that is going to completely kill reddit Im rather apprehensive about this move by Reddit I dont give a shit about individual people and the community of Reddit is perfect for that style Its something that made Reddit standout from other social media platforms This could be a huge mistake Frankly I may dislike it enough to be looking for another Reddit alternative Not that anyone gives a shit about my opinion but I spend so much time on this site I wanted to voice it anyways Edit Fuck it Im not even worried about it anymore I was for like  minutes and then I realized if they wanted to kill their site by making it into some stupid social media thing then there will definitely be a new Reddit anyways Ah well Will this feature be canceled if this alpha test doesnt work well I hope this is a true trial and not a weve already decided this is going to happen I dont like it Seems like a social network there are enough of those So what happens to AMAs Presumably most high profile AMAs will now go through personal pages rather than the AMA sub or subs related to the person answering questions Moving this to the personal page allows those who do AMAs to delete questions they dont want to answer As well as all comments that potentially challenge the hosts ideas Why allow the hosts of the AMA to control the narrative For example if this was the case back when Woody Harrelson did his AMA he could delete every question that didnt relate to Rampart If Donald Trump does an AMA it will allow him to silence anyone who has a question he doesnt like If Papa John of Pizza fame did an AMA he could delete all posts that dont enforce a positive view of their product This change is not for the users is it Its for the already prevalent mass marketing campaign on Reddit to flourish without challenge I wonder how Voats doing Since when are subreddits called communities I smell marketing BS about our visitors dont understand the word subreddit I very rarely comment on these things however this change kills what attracted me to reddit in the first place Can you guys please PLEASE not do this I understand every new CEO wants to add their own mark on reddit but nobody is complaining about Power Users not having enough tools to garner followers Most people dont really like the concept of Power Users to begin with and you guys are actively supporting it here I understand there are workaround creating your own subreddit but its different when you as a company publicly approve and give them your support Please please please stop taking reddit farther away than its original purpose You exist in the tech economy When users stop appreciating what youre doing they will go somewhere else You dont want to be historically remembered as Digg  edit Im not an experienced moderator or an eloquent speaker but Ive created rrexit as a place to discuss whats going on with Reddit and what our options are If anyone wants to help that would be much appreciated I hate how social media sites cultivate an atmosphere that makes them successful and then try to integrate portions of other social networks that made them successful Reddits not for creators its for communities  ctrlF twitter clone  See my points have already been made several dozen times Wander away Oh god no Please no I came here for the content not to have the bastard child of twitter and facebook with a shitty layout looking back at me These are forums st  Wow Way to turn into twitter reddit I dunno I like Reddit because of the focus on communities rather than specific people I feel like this is kinda unnecessary and just hurts that You say its to give a home for people to put their original content but cant subreddits already do that Is this an attempt to kill Twitter So when do I start getting candy crush invites from all of my friends grandmothershttpimgpandawhalecompostobiwankenobiIlovedyougifIawHgif Just remember this is LITERALLY what killed Digg I appreciate that youre trying to innovate and improve the site I like the recent changes youve made to post scores and I browse rpopular way more than I used to browse rall This change however feels like a fundamental change to the site one which goes against why I joined Reddit in the first place I love that Reddit is focused almost entirely on content and community instead of individual users Sure there are famous redditors like ushittywatercolour and uGallowBoob But they got their fame by being frequent contributors who post good content I feel this new feature could move some famous users focus from subreddits to their own user pages which could ultimately lead to a decrease in the overall quality of content in the subreddits that they would have previously submitted that content to Im sure youve considered this option but I think a happy medium would be adding some kind of Pin to my profile button to posts that youve made They would essentially function as stickied threads in subreddits only on the current iteration of the user page This would allow users to highlight content that they feel is a good representation of who they are on reddit without introducing this new mainstream mefirst social media aspect edited for clarity Im not opposed and dont think its wrong but from an initial impression I see some features and concepts that take away the uniqueness of Reddit and make it blend with a lot of other social media platforms I could just be overprotective of my nostalgia from Redditing for a while now this account doesnt reflect how long I have been  but this seems to put an emphasis on names people brands  where my enjoyment has come from a focus on content I didnt have a chance to type out all my thoughts and Im just as interested to see how this plays out just food for thought I dont like this Its gonna a Facebook clone with people following other people instead of following subreddits devoted for content Oh good so now the site is another shit social media clone because you know that what I want when I go to reddit I want FaceBook light Admins do you guys just not realize why this site is popular Cant you leave well enough alone Why do none of you realize that you had a good thing going I genuinely think this is an awful idea Im not in social media because I dont like it I dont want Reddit to feel like more of a popularity contest Yes there are users that we all like to see pop up from time to time but thats the beauty of Reddit We get to see them from time to time the rest of the time its just regular users doing regular user things Allowing people to post on their profiles is going to make Reddit feel just like Facebook and people on Facebook are leaving because it is Facebook They are coming here because it is not Also when I click the link to go to the alpha testers profiles I get a message saying that the link isnt available Im using Reddit is Fun Platinum if that helps Bad update Dont ruin this website by selling out to companies and making it another platform for them to sell their shit to us Keep it like it is and never change This is clearly a change aimed at pleasing advertisers From the rmodnews announcement Could these kinds of selfposts appear on rall or rpopular Yes The new user page will allow a brand to build a following and in turn their user posts will reach the front page without any of the community moderation This is clearly intended to allow brands similar control like twitter and facebook This change only makes it easier to game or bot the system Without the moderation that popular and frontpage subreddits have this allows advertisements to directly rise to the front page of reddit with ease Likely the next major change will be promoted user posts im just going to copy this comment by uvenom It speaks for me and if anybody else feels the same they should just copy it and paste it too People have already stated my feelings more eloquently than I am capable of in this thread Maybe my contribution to quantity will be of some value I reiterate what the vast majority of this thread has said we dont fucking want this Tell the advertisers or whoever is pressuring you to do this to shove it up their ass Let Reddit be Reddit please For the love of god please We harbor no loyalty to your sit and if Digg or the fall of Yahoo to Google werent signs enough that in the tech world things can go from lively to a ghost town in a quick second let me remind you The userbase has almost no confidence in the Reddit team anymore and if a better Reddit comes along well jump ship in a hurry If you dont believe me just keep pushing shit like this out Just remember my comment in the future when youve driven your company in to the ground Again we dont fucking want this Stop pls One thing I hate that the Reddit admins keep trying to make Reddit about the big users I even remember you made Tom Hanks into a marketing scheme and you started giving famous users flairs for the whole site Its pretty bad as Reddit is supposed to be for the masses not for the upvotes and karma grabbers So if this is to be a great thing it must be for the users and not for the sellers Which will be really hard to do If I wanted to be on Facebook I would go to Facebook deleted This feels really Facebookey and I dont like it Im hoping they trash it during alpha and it never becomes a site wide thing This feels like a change thats going to backfire and kill Reddit You seriously need to abandon this now Oh no Part of what makes Reddit great is the uniform nature of everyones profile not giving one person more sense of their identity besides their post If I wanted my original content in one place maybe I could tag it instead of changing an entire profile eg complete with cover photos Or even have a section for links to other media in a profile eg Deviantart portfolios Instagram One of the reasons I loved reddit is its integrity You judge a person completely by their commentposts and occasionally their username not by things like signatures and avatars that plague other forumbased sites This has the potential to fuck up Reddit Interesting I come to Reddit to get away from Facebook Dont you think turning it into a Social Media style website with profiles will reduce the quality of content since people now have their personal reputation at stake The disconnect from your real and professional life is what allows for honest posting I get that you can optout but once you open that can of worms theres no going back especially if its optin by default Reddit the front page facetwittersnapgrambook of the internet This is not made clear in the OP The admins are planning to allow posts to these pages to be shown on rall and rpopular I think this is a terrible idea personally though Im not necessarily opposed to the profile page idea itself Im still keeping an open mind about being opposed to it though depending how this goes But I wanted to make it clear to anyone who only read the OP here that they forgot to mention these posts will go to rall and rpopular too edit Yesterday in the rmodnews thread they said posts on usersubs would be visible on rall and rpopular This was also one of the most hotly contested things in that thread so I am shocked that they did not include it in the OP here uspez has now said somethinghttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentspntldrtodayweretestingoutanewfeaturethatdfjhicontext about this not being definite yet I guess well have to wait and see what the admins decide but I still say thats a very bad idea Ew The beauty of reddit is that it stays topical and anonymous If you want to see what happens when you make it about individuals look no further than youtube tumblr twitter facebook hell all of it Sigh Im not fooled this is  about money Youre turning this place into a shit hole so you can make more money But the cash cow will only last as long as users can stomach it This idea is dumb and youre all dumb for coming up with it it seems like this is going to be an attempt to pave the way into making reddit a social media site similar to Facebook Twitter etc Im not sure if it works Facebook and Twitter have already locked the market down there Also I like reddit because its not yet another social media site Im pretty apprehensive about this move Cant wait see Gallowboobs profile on rpopular all day every day Are you guys trying to make Redditbook I dont see the real benefit here Do you think that having user profile posts show up on rall and rpopular instead of only on the subscribers front page is going to amplify the super user problem You said this is something that is possible HEREhttpswwwredditcomrmodnewscommentsiutomorrowwellbelaunchinganewposttoprofiledfku Isnt this entirely antithetical to the core of reddit which is facilitating and building communities  ie the feature is more about one user rather than a collective creation itself I think an interactive user profile is a good idea But I am not sold  at all  on its showing up on rall or rpopular Anyone have any arguments for this integration Oh cool This should be a great tool for content creators and definitely doesnt seem like a way for corporate social media teams to shit up the site by creating huge monolithic branded accounts and filling the site with more useless visually intrusive advertising If this leaves alpha then fuck reddit damn I hate this feature This seems completely unnecessary and may destroy reddit deleted I know youre still testing but I feel that not having profiles is kind of what makes Reddit great Sure some accounts are well known uGallowboob for example but the reason that Reddit has discussion like no other sites is because everyone is equal Idk maybe I have no idea how the site works but not having profiles has actually been my favorite thing about Reddit deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk tldr For some dumbfuck reason weve decided to turn Reddit into Facebook I dont need one of the last somewhat cool places on the internet turning into another narcissismadvertising outlet Ill go to Tumblr and Twitter if I want those things I come to Reddit because the narcissism is buried in thousands of communities and the advertising is easy to tune out I dont understand this feature why it was implemented or what kind of show Spez is running over there but this is laughably incompetent and makes me wonder how out of touch the admins really are You guys Digg that hole a little deeper with each new announcement  I know this will probably be drowned out by the wave of comments but Id like to say this anyway what you have here is not Reddit It may be Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or every other social medium but it isnt Reddit Most other popular social media are all about me me me Reddit is not and thats why Im here These pages dont even look like Reddit At first glance Id think it was a Twitter clone I really truly hope that you reconsider this It may just ruin the site deleted Yeah once I read brands I kinda tuned out Wow this is a fucking horrible idea When I go to a subreddit I go there to interact with EVERYONE I remember the times where SWC would come to random big threads and paint funny shit I remember when important shit from knthing was in places everyone could see I remember rioters being forced to answer serious concerns on the league subreddits Things Ive literally been a part of for years Now youre telling me I have to follow them specifically That what they will no longer contribute to the discussion because we are all unworthy or something Why cant they do what Reddit has ALWAYS done  create content in subreddits Obviously by my profile im no mega user or anything I just have enjoyed Reddit for many years and I REALLY hope this doesnt happen I dont want to see these people take this to their own profile instead of sharing it with everyone because I dont care about their profile I dont SWC wont paint things that I have the context for It must not be important if knthing is rambling on his profile like facebook It must not matter to Riot to no longer interact in their subreddit ALREADY and post shit in their profile that the people of the subreddit deserve to see and discuss God this idea is terrible I cant believe youve found a way to Digg this place but you have Youre all rich already wildly rich Why fuck it up for the millions of people that just LOVE being on Reddit For more money It doesnt make any sense I cant believe a focus group for  normal redditors would come together and be hyped as fuck for this Can you block stalkers or turn that function off Whens reddits Snapchat clone coming out deleted Honestly this is a little scary First I used Tumblr for about  months or so Then I kind of stopped not really feeling engaged at all with any posts I was seeing Then I went to Twitter I only used Twitter for about  months Once again I just didnt like the overall focus on who ever posted the tweet Nobody discussed anything nobody did anything except reply to who ever tweeted Now Ive been using Reddit for  months I pretty much love it Theres always something to read cool things to talk about and I can connect with others who have the same interests as me But with these profiles I cant help like Reddit is trying to be more like the bigger social media sites like Twitter Tumblr Instagram etc And that difference is what makes me like Reddit so much in the first place When I first read this post I didnt really understand what this ment and thought it could work out OK Then I started to read the comments and this opened up my eyes to see what could go wrong More people could follow a singular user and less prevalence that doesnt seem like the right word is put on the communities  of the time when I read a comment I dont care who posted it I only really look at the name if someone else mentions something and I check who posted that comment I might go Oh look its blank Ive seen them on some other posts theyre pretty funny  Then I move along Reddit to me is a place where it doesnt really matter who you are you still have a chance to participate in the conversation With profile pages for the most well known creators or business or personalities it starts to feel more like everyone else doesnt really matter Thank you for reading this has been my longest comment Ive ever written I hope I conveyed my message Im not the best writer around I notice that the comments of the users in the beta are not visible only the posts That is really not helpful for those of us that create original content in comments and not with posts No thank you I dont like where this is going Like a Facebook timeline I dont want this As if reddit didnt have celebrity worship before jesus christ can an indiviual user disable their own profile not sure i like this primarily because it gives certain people special status over everyone else their content no longer has to go through the upvoting process they get a free pass because all their subs will see everything they do and upvote that kind of defeats the crowd voting aspects of reddit IMO and soon were just gonna see certain people over and over on the front page not to mention all their shitty content appears to everyone who follows them These accounts are also definitely going to get monetized and turned into ad machines to some extent It detracts from the community feel of reddit and seems like its falling into normal social media trends a la facebook or instagram or youtube I hate it We all saw what happened to MySpace when they decided to change it all up It died instantly Reddit isnt a site about personal profiles Let social media keep that arena Theres nothing else like reddit so changing reddit to be more like social media will completely kill the reason to even use reddit This idea sucks bottom line Im just a voice in the wind here  not a power user or well known in any community or even a content creator  but I want to register my dislike for this as well This strikes me as a giant leap in removing power from communities and giving it to outside interests Most of us dont follow users we follow subjects and content Its a pretty profile but a distasteful concept I sincerely think this is a horrible idea Reddit it is a site where users come together and discuss in communities not promote their own profile That it its niche When sites try to become something theyre not they can die fast Look at Digg or even Yik Yak for an example Yik Yaks niche was that it was an anonymous posting site for people to talk about their schoolarea It was fun because it built community within the area Then they added usernames and it went to shit If Reddit adds profiles it will also turn to shit it will basically become Tumblr or Facebook Please god no This is my first cake day Ive been here for exactly a year and I can absolutely say that reddit has changed my life I honestly dont know what I used to do on the internet before reddit Im a bit of a shutin and I hate that Ive only found this site so recently I hear other redditors talk about how this site used to be with an incredible amount of fondness and I wish I had been here to experience all of that and Im thankful for the last year Ive had here Every single change youve made in the last year and the changes Ive read about after the fact and their effects I see to be onthewhole fine Some of them have been questionable to hardcore longterm redditors such as the change making comments accrue karma and sponsored posts but this takes it over the edge This change is a mistake that is obviously moneydriven and it will hurt the character of the site in a devastating way While I understand that Reddit is a business and it is only supposed to be about money this will hurt you in the long run Why would you want to be more like facebook or youtube Reddit has a unique character and you are literally trashing it with this change Please dont do this Look out guys Reddit found the keys to the clone machine In another comment you stated The goal of this product is to create a platform for creators To me this sounds like a stepping stone to monetization of individual user profiles Content creators with popular pages are offered the ability to place targeted advertisements on their pages  with reddit getting a share of course Can you elaborate on whether this is part of future plans I really cant envision this having any purpose other than being a stepping stone to a cash grab I am not a fan of this change This site while not strictly anonymous fuels discussion without the fear of someone attaching your name to your open thoughts Its not just that though attaching identity to content changes the dynamic of a social media site and puts the focus on the people rather than the ideas Look at famous redditors like uGallowboob His limited anonymity changes the behavior of the community with which he interacts simply because he is a known person Creating a culture of lesser anonymity just creates a catalyst for the suppression and dilution of the culture itself Then once you create an incentive for users to make them self known through followers and notoriety youll find that your social structure changes to those like instagram facebook twitter etc People without notoriety become less meaningful and so does their content Likewise filtering circles of users and increasingly narrowed exposure to unliked content and people will continue to make communities stale This is a myspace or digg level change Youre removing the essence of this site Maybe not completely or immediately but this is the first change of many that moves your business in the wrong direction to its user base httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaUEAGCo Watch Moot speak to this very thing and think about why he protected that idea People have already stated my feelings more eloquently than I am capable of in this thread Maybe my contribution to quantity will be of some value I reiterate what the vast majority of this thread has said we dont fucking want this Tell the advertisers or whoever is pressuring you to do this to shove it up their ass Let Reddit be Reddit please For the love of god please We harbor no loyalty to your sit and if Digg or the fall of Yahoo to Google werent signs enough that in the tech world things can go from lively to a ghost town in a quick second let me remind you The userbase has almost no confidence in the Reddit team anymore and if a better Reddit comes along well jump ship in a hurry If you dont believe me just keep pushing shit like this out Just remember my comment in the future when youve driven your company in to the ground Again we dont fucking want this Stop pls This seems to have broken the RiF app  nothing shows on uShittyWatercolour s page for me deleted This seems like the first step on a very slippery slope towards becoming a Facebook or Twitter This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to reddit Brb taking a snapshot of reddit right now so after it becomes Facebook we can go back to the good old days I understand people dont like change but this is taking a huge turn as far as reddit goes Down the Wrong path Please dont do this Im ending my gold subscription on my other account if this makes it way to the norm Well theres  comments as of now so my comment wont be read but Ill try anyways Ive been really supportive of reddits decisions to innovate the past couple years but I think this is a really bad idea Reddit is about communities not individuals I feel like this change will make reddit feel more like youtube where youre encouraged to follow personalities and see updates from them What I enjoy about reddit is that everyone is on the same playing field follows the same rules and I feel like this taints that In an effort to try and understand your position Ive got a couple questions you can answer  What is the goal of this change  What kind of direction is this taking reddit Where do yall envision reddit to be in   or  years I know you guys are trying your best to avoid a digglike exodus but I feel like this could really upset the community Ive just got a really bad feeling about this Theres a fucking reason I dont use social media  I dont want a profile page I dont want followers and I dont want to follow anyone This is just a stepping stone to turn reddit soon to be plebbit into an even bigger dick measuring contest and function as a shitty twitter feed Also allowing brands to make their own profiles is bullshit too I dont want to be advertised to even more than I already am by corporate shills pushing their bullshit to the front page everyday under the guise of being a meme But sure reddit will milk this for some cash before letting this ship sink ICEBERG AHEAD When real life friends ask me what is this reddit thing about I usually say its like the other social networks you know but instead of seeing content you dont care about from people you know you just engage with content you care about from people you dont even want to know anything about And thats the great thing It looks like reddit is becoming less great Can a users profile page be quarantined I rarely bother with announcement posts past a glance but when I saw this one my stomach literally sank I am absolutely opposed to this Obviously from your lack of responses in this thread you dont give a shit and thats the biggest mistake of all The moment this place turns into another Facebook Im leaving It seems like a lot of us agree with this sentiment and I doubt youll get an influx of users with how similar it will be to other sites Implementing this will likely kill you instead of making you money like you want Turning REDDIT into FACEBOOK WTF for  Less anonymity sucks The great thing about reddit iswas that you never know you might be having a conversation with a worldrenowned neurosurgeon or a high school dropout billionaire or just some homeless guy at the library Making users notequal is shit So basically Reddit becomes Facebook Who asked for this And this is obviously wildly unpopular can we at least have a vote Hey guys I hope you enjoyed my post Be sure to follow my profile and hit that upvote button Ill see you guys next time I swear the first time I see something like that Im quitting Reddit This is an awful idea Weve come to reddit specifically to get away form invasive sites like Facebook where your profiles are the focus of the site Reddit is supposed to be like the anonymous chatboards of old but ideally less toxic than chan due to it being slightly less anonymous with usernames With a feature like this our privacy is yet again being stripped away So Im a mobile user who uses the desktop site That user page is almost functionally broken I do not like this at all I do not want Reddit to turn into a place where user fight over followers like every other social media sight in the world This is also going to lead to brigading of a popular users post which is already a problem on Reddit and it will also be easy for corporations to get a ton of upovotes because of brigading on posts that are really just advertisements which is also a huge problem on Reddit The fact that users cant have followers or subs is one of the Key factors of what seperates Reddit from other social media sites that exploit its users for ad revenue PLEASE do not implement this feature Do you think this is the end of Reddit This is such a stupid feature and direction for the website I really hope this leads to the death of reddit so I can leave this shithole once and for all How the fuck is there not more outrage over this So you want reddit to be facebook now You realize most of us are trying to get away from facebook right Reddit isnt a social media site besides a very very few recognizable users the beauty of reddit is that no one knows who anyone else is when they are replying to a comment Thats what makes this work I really dont care for thisas others have stated I like the relative anonymity of Reddit and would like to keep it that way EDIT I was thinking more generally that the platform of reddit would become less anonymous as a whole I like that everyone is anonymousno profiles no about me descriptions no picturesjust a history of content Admins are doing there usual question dodging Nice Its badvery bad It will hinter the organic threads Its like following celebrities on Instagram and twitter This will create an even bigger echo chamber besides the users with good number of followers will start endorsing products subtly Is it some sort of way to try to monetize famous users so that seeing this other original creators leave different other sites and come here on reddit because of its huge number of users Is this the way to monetize reddit Oh reddit admins this is a fantastic and elaborate April Fools prank You got the jump on us by starting it early so we wouldnt be suspicious Nice I mean we all know this is the last thing your users want so youre just announcing it now as a part of the big joke later Right right Noooo please this isnt facebook Not having a profile like that is exactly what makes reddit different give us profiles and its no different to facebook twitter instagram There is way too much white space It looks like crap on a smaller screen What happened to being able to see comments or comments and posts What happened to trophies subs they mod etc Why the push to make reddit more like facebook or twitter If we wanted that wouldnt we be there instead What about the tabs at the top like gilded Why is reddit constantly trying to come up with solutions to problems that dont exist instead of focusing on existing problems By far my biggest worry is that this will give incentive for users to only post on their profile pages  completely changing the site and rendering subreddits as second thoughts I understand the urge to want to highlight users that post awesome and exciting stuff and at times I too would love to have a more prominent platform but honestly Reddit is great because it is anonymous and people contribute together towards making subreddits informative interesting and funny Please do not allow narcissism to enter the fray I want reddit to be more like facebook  some asshole somewhere People will like this Its the people that are in love with themselves that will like this There is a large market for that Reddit grew into what it is by appealing to those that arent JUST in love with themselves The crowd that only social medias on reddit to avoid the people that are in love with themselves me and I imagine a few others will hate this Everyone was equal in their anonymity now fake profile pictures and manufactured identities will skew how peoples contributions are judged DO NOT CARE FOR THIS ONE BIT It looks too much like Twitter in style if you ask me I think a blurb about yourself and a user icon are welcome additions however It may be important that we should also have the option to mark things as NSFW Including our profile pictures While were on the subject though Id like to have the option to block other users from viewing where Im active and this seems like a perfect opportunity to debut that feature This privacy feature has been a feature Ive wanted to be a part of reddit for ages in addition to taking action against thoughtcrime bans in general This allows some subs such as rOffMyChest to make actual thought crime bans based on where youre active Regardless if youve made a post or broken any rules there If you ask to be unbanned Theyll give you a canned response about these subreddits they dont approve of And state that theyll only even think about talking to you if you promise to never post there again IMO this is a grievous overstep of their authority of mods of one subreddit and yknow going through someones post history to dig up dirt on them is just a plain shitty thing to do  Hi there uHideHideHidden Id like to thank you for the all of the enjoyment Ive had since I migrated here from Digg many many years ago I came here back in the day because Digg decided to implement some kind of weird socialmediapoweruser system that caused all of the users to leave and basically destroyed Digg as a business overnight Could you offer some recommendations for Reddit alternatives once you realise that this is a terrible idea I really dont like the idea of Reddit turning into another social media site If thats what your overall goal is then go for it Otherwise I think a lot of users arent too keen on this idea and you could lose a lot of the users if you go through with it You know what this sounds like LiveJournal Personal pages that people can comment community pages subreddits to join and post on hell youve even got avatars and banners By the way how are you going to police those If another Fappening happens how will you make sure users dont put the pictures in their avatars or banners Because that could get you a nice big pile of lawsuits You really should have done some sitewide market research on this instead of just asking the people who make monetary profit Why would anyone want this This is a shit idea thats going to kill reddit I dont give a fuck who anyone is or what theyre up to Im interested in ideas not personalities Hopefully someone will hurry up and build a site like the old reddit without all this social profile shit and we can all move there This is a x worse idea than reddit notes ever was This might the worst idea that anyone at reddit has ever had except you fools are actually going through with it This is slow company suicide being broadcast live RUINING YOUR PLATFORM IS NOT WORTH THE ADREVENUE PLEASE STOP ooooooo wow we can post direclty to our prifile fuck off you stupid fucking admins It looks like other social media sites The thing I like about Reddit is that you dont have to put any effort into your profile  deciding on an icon a witty introduction statement etc If I feel like doing that I can visit any number of other sites Here at Reddit I feel like I can just relax and be in the moment of a particular thread or comment Im so tired of the internet wanting us to build up followers or likes or whatever  I just want to relax here at Reddit Pls dont do this I have never seen a comment thread on reddit so unanimous such as this one That said I totally agree with literally every other post here Giving a place for companies to drive traffic to for their marketers instead of giving them incentive to actually participate in the community associated with their company where the people are in control and not the corporation is just fucking bonkers Part of the beauty of Reddit is that nobody is behind this username There should be no reason for other users to visit each others pages unless to find something they posted This is a move on the wrong direction imo The internet is full of a million different social networks and profiles the last thing we need is Reddit to move in that direction too No one asked for this Now that we know what it is we dont want it Leading content creators are chiming in here saying they dont want it Its a shitty google plusesque idea Its a transparent money grab My question is could you not So every users profile will include what is essentially their own sub now right Am I understanding that correctly Just no please dont In case youve not noticed reddit works fine as it is Please dont turn it into Facebook light This is a shit idea and whoever came up with it should be forced to communicate only through MySpace untill theyve learned their lesson No bad reddit bad This choice is the opposite of what makes Reddits brand Its the beginning of the end for sure This feels so wrong and not Reddit Reddit should be organized based around ideas  topics discussions should not revolve around individual redditors or profiles It takes focus away from what makes this site great Content creators aka users are here to make Subs better not the other way around Also Wont this inevitably take content away from the subs where these users USED to post It seems like this will drain whatever is left from this awesome tool and subdivide it into another favebooky insta bullshit feed Am I going too overboard here This will be such an easy way to bypass our spamfilter I hope youll come up with a solution to filter submissions and comments that link to profile page posts This feels like taking away from the community and placing focus on individuals Like every other social network It sounds lame to me not gonna lie We all know that try and alpha really means youre doing it and just figuring out the details So that sucks Im tired of following people Im more interested in conversations than individuals yo we facebook now Im sure it will be as successful as Google Pretty much everyone has already touched on all the reasons I feel this is a terrible move for Reddit so I wont rehash everything And I feel like you have had to known this is the reaction most of the reddit users would have hearing this news so I dont really trust the intentions you state in this post and comments about why this feature is being implemented I really hope you decide to ditch this feature after alpha We dont need another facebook Sorry guys but I dont think this is a good idea Reddit works for a reason We dont want it to be about  person sharing content its meant to be about community doing it together When we started rReallifedoodles the idea was to get as many people involved as possible making fun gifs not it being about one person If I wanted that I would of started rsooperdaviddrawsfacesonvideos or something I see youre trying to change things Im not sure why but you have something that works and opening it up like this seems quite digg like It seems a bit like you are trying to decide what people want to see that you know best You dont know what people want and it annoys people when you decide for them Maybe I am misunderstanding this feature but I dont think its what Reddit wants I hope you dont mess this up Will there be a way to completely optout of this system Based on what Im reading this profile system seems to be the exact opposite of what I use reddit for Implement it for those who want it but dont force those of us who dont to have profiles I dont want my front page clogged with peoples profiles either Honestly this seems like a huge step in the wrong direction The styling of this is just not right If you want to be another Facebook or Twitter then you have done the right thing But I dont think Reddit should be emulating those platforms I stay off FB as much as possible because I dont want too much of my stuff shared on there The anonymity here is another reason I like it here I only have to share what I want to share Making me post a profile picture and allowing ANYONE to follow me is a mistake As a redditor for more than  years the two things Im proud of most are the subreddits I moderate and the trophies I accrued Does this take away both Im on mobile and the example profiles are a mess completely unreadable so forgive me if I simply missed them I see from the alpha user profiles there are posts to their profile listed directly next to their posts in other subreddits Everyone has been told time and time again that voting on stuff from a users profile page is bad and will get your account suspended Is there a change on the official stance for this now When I view someones profile page do I need to be careful to only vote on stuff submitted directly to their profile and not stuff submitted to subreddits So Reddit is turning into Facebook Awesome s Nope Do not want Terrible fucking idea This is the first step into fundamentally turning Reddit into Facebook This place thrives because of the individual communities where like minded people can talk about whatever theyre into Honestlywhat in the hell are you guys thinking I come here to get content without bullshit social media If I wanted a Facebook page Id make one Fuck this whole idea Play this off as a big April fools joke and save face  Where do I go if I want to learn about somebody or follow somebodys work Their website Facebook Instagram Twitter Where do I not go and not want to go Reddit If I am interested enough in a particular piece of content on Reddit I will seek out the creator elsewhere  Optin and optout is a false choice I can see no realistic way that this does not fundamentally impact the way that Reddit is used The optin and optout decision is one that would take place within the new system not one that would determine anything about its being in place In other words this is not like In addition to checkers we now also offer chess and you can choose either this is like Instead of checkers we now offer chessbut you can continue to play by the rules of checkers if you like The game is just different This is a shitty idea and you all know its a shitty idea This isnt a typical they changed the page formatmenuui complaint that we used to see from Facebook This is a fundamental change in the way this site works and generates content Cant you see nobody likes this idea I hope you enjoy the temporary boost in cash flow before this website pulls another Digg you fucking idiots Ive been reading some of the comments and your reactions and I want to add this it is not hard to post OC in subreddits and gain traction I am not necessarily a content creator but I do provide original content to subreddits I like to think this is my pseudoanonymous account since I also have an account to post some of the photos I make I would not want to post these photos to my personal account where they will be seen by no one because I have no followers I want to post them to photo subreddits like rEarthPorn rphotography or rphotocritique Of course seasoned users will still keep doing things like this For new users this system is incredibly confusing They will not gain any traction in their profile posts since their posts will not be seen in rall and rpopular I also think that profile posts shouldnt be seen in these subs Twitter and Facebook both have more active single users than Reddit When you make a system in Reddit that is comparable to these sites new users will try to imitate what theyve been doing over at those sites For example if I have the possibility to set a profile picture I will to look more dedicated It also looks so clumsy to keep the default picture This will make me set a profile picture which is something that doesnt fit into the spirit of Reddit at all I can guarantee that this will turn Reddit more towards the FBTwitterside of the social media spectrum Another problem You are testing this only with people that directly benefit of it and for them I dont think this is a bad idea at all But the results of the test will not at all be representative of the way it will work when it is rolled out Based on all this I think its an okay feature not great but okay when you separate these new profile account from the average lurker and sometimesposter account Maybe introduce a button Turn into personal profile which will then make Reddit treat your profile as a subreddit in every way save for the fact you can also post to subreddits and comment sections under that name I think its a terrible idea to give this feature as a default for everyone because it will turn Reddit into a Twitter clone with added subject pages also called subreddits Youre trying to make this platform into social media I purposely use reddit for how different enraging and thoughtful it can be Not because I want to waste my time with frivolous profile pages If it moves into that direction i will leave just as I have with others Reddit has always had something special but movies like this to homogenise the experience provided with every other social media platform will be the end of that quality Aaaand the downfall of reddit begins Meh Not thrilled with this one Everyone will oppose this because it takes power away from users mods and subreddits The admins will push it through anyways because it gives power to corporations and advertisers who will give money to the admins because they can now better control conversations about their products This is just the next step in reddits inevitable decline and another example of how greed corrupts uShittyWatercolour why the fuck would you support this shitty idea This feels vehemently antiReddit at its core Consider me against this You guys seem incredibly out of touch with your users literally the worst thing you can do Reddit I know my voice is small but guess what I dont want other peoples voice to be big this is just utter garbage literal barf way to wreck Reddit hosers fucken seriouslywhat are you thinking why would you do this it makes no sense So its Facebook now Why dont you just add the option to label it as Oc when posting Then have it link to your username the same way all your other posts do Edit I had more words I use Reddit because its not Facebook but it is already close enough to make me uncomfortable Any more steps toward it and Ill have to use something like chan instead Looks like private browsing for me from now on So facebook then Yay It seems like many arent fans of this new feature myself included I think its just going to take away from already established communitiessubreddits and seems like a waste of time I come here because its not Facebook Now you want to make it Facebook I would be upset but willing to just not come here anymore Im one person so whats it matter to you anyway I dont understand is reddit facebooktwitter now Like this will only be beneficial to the top  karama whores of reddit No one else is going to follow me for my great post that got  upvotes on rhockey This just makes reddit look like its trying super hard to be its distant social media cousin If i wanted to follow someone Id go to twitter or facebook Reddit is a place of some anonymity It also takes away from people visiting and contributing to subreddits Why go to a subreddit if I can just visit someones facebook page oops I mean reddit user page I use reddit because its at least partially anonymous This just removes the appeal of the site for me if I want to follow people and post on walls Ill use facebook or twitter I just felt sad when I read this This destroys all the things that makes reddit unique I know Im repeating what other people have commented but its important for you guys to know that this is a big mistake All this does is silence dissenting views on products and companies by letting the company control the narrative This is just another nail in the coffin Based on the replies to this post it looks like Reddit is hellbent on bulldozing through this feature that no one wants Reddit you would do well to listen to the users on this You have a very passionate user base and you are about to give everyone the finger here Nothing will be gained from this No company is bigger than its user base We are here for the communities which are the backbone of Reddit If you try to sway the balance in favour of brands and individuals we will move on very quickly Reddit is an extremely discerning community and a replacement will quickly be found Our loyalty only goes so far And if this becomes another ego driven userbrand orientated network people wont stick around Fuck off this is a pathetic corporate takeover and we all know it Yeah Ill just leave Reddit if this happens This is the kind of stuff that made me leave Facebook Instagram Snapchat  Its gonna take spez a really really long time to edit all these posts to be supportive of this unpopular idea Yay another profile said no one Ever So this is how reddit ends This is so sad Everyone who knows and loves reddit can see this is a corporate moneygrab This will not improve the community Its not intended to foster and develop communities The language I see explaining this new feature tells me it will not be a choice This will be the future of reddit because it capitalizes on the same strategies that make every other social media money Its a damn shame really Its funny because Reddit doesnt actually care about our opinions on this matter Theyve already decided to move this direction and the odds of them changing their minds at this point are slim to none The only reason they are pitching the idea to us this way is to try and ease us into the drastic changes coming up I was considering sticking around to see this play out but I already know how this ends Just saying good bye to all you fellow redditors Im going to try out a couple of these alternative sites or maybe even chan Its been real Its been fun But it hasnt been real fun I really dont want Reddit to turn into a social media page This will end up taking people away from subreddits and making them follow specific profiles where the owners have total mod power over the content But I get it This system is better for profiles that needwant proliferation Its not something that I agree with we already have Facebook and Twitter for that but oh well business is business Wasnt Reddit supposed to be a forum for anything and everything Sounds like everyone really hates this stupid idea Well done Reddit Might as well just reactivate my facebook at this point Maybe I should consider joining twitter too I like Reddit because its about following communities built on specific intereststopics NOT following specific people who post whatever they feel like just to get attention I sincerely hope that you made this post so you could get feedback from redditors and that youll actually take what we feel into consideration Stop this nonsense now before you disappoint your users Dont fix things that arent broken Pron profiles incoming I feel like this could kill Reddits Content Quality It would handicap subReddits by creating a group of Influencers similar to Instagram and vine that would get priority over other users content basically rendering the Best rating useless Content on Reddit is democratic you look into a Topicsub you like and find cool shit if you add in influencers you intentionally subvert that I m not saying dont do it Im just saying be careful by imitating other Social Media youre abandoning your core competencies How will you protect users from being harassed Will users be able to block and delete problem commenters Will users be able to allow commenters on a casebycase basis Will users be allowed to optout of this feature all together I dont like this at all As others have pointed out this change makes reddit seem more like a shittier version of every other social media platform What makes reddit unique at least for me is the fact that I dont have to follow specific people to find content that I like and that those same people arent the ones that dictate what gets posted This addition may give newcomers a bad idea about what reddit actually has its roots in  community Maybe from a business perspective you guys may be thinking this is a great addition because it has all of the quirks that other social platforms have that lead them to success I disagree This is the beginning of the end of reddit Have any comments in here been edited by uspez Could you make modmail be less awful Its difficult to keep track of any messages when you mod even a couple of subreddits uknthing are there any plans for serverside growth There have been many complaints recently about users having lots of problems with server bounce pages becoming a frequent sight Im just curious what can be done to help mitigate that if its even a noticeable problem on the large end versus the user side deleted Lets get a sub going for unremarkable pictures of people that died that I miss so they dont keep getting posted in rpics No matter who you are if a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity sexual excitement or engaged in any act of sexual conduct is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission it is prohibited on reddit We could probably use some clarification on moderating this rule on rPhotoshopBattles and some heads up on how strictly it will be enforced We regularly have images of celebrities posted and sometimes members of the public that get photoshopped into looking like they are nude or that depict them performing sexual acts Actually on my front page right now this post is directly below a PsB thread of Emma Stone accidentally showing her crotch and there are photoshops in the thread that depict nudity or that make it look like there is sexual conduct happening There is one depicting her with a penis and John Travolta looking like he is about to kiss it This image would seem to be prohibited on reddit now if it is do moderators have a responsibility to enforce the rule or should we assume that someone else is going to deal with it Would John Travolta or Emma Stone have to contact reddit or will images that we can assume they would not approve of be removed by admins We also get images where people photoshop violent situations into images usually in a horror movietype context or with famous historical images that depict violence How strict should the violent personalized images rule be taken and is it now up to moderators to enforce or should we leave it to admins edit typos Finding all of these communities is too hard Usually its done by running into them in the comments somewhere or finding them in sidebars of other subreddits Can you just put a special search box on the home page or something with an autosuggest that matches subreddit names when I start typing RES already does this when I start typing r in a comments box That way if Im bored I could just start typing something and see what matching subs come up No matter who you are if a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity sexual excitement or engaged in any act of sexual conduct is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission it is prohibited on reddit How will permission work What constitutes valid permission Do photos of pornstars count as implicit permission due to their profession edit And as mikerman mentioned there doesnt seem to be explicit permission for any sort of nude stuff beyond GW This seems like it makes nearly all NSFW content against site rules which would make removing it pretty much arbitrary assuming that NSFW subs arent wiped out entirely by this change edit again Their policy states reddit is committed to your privacy If you believe that someone has submitted without your permission to reddit a link to a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct please contact us contactredditcom and we will expedite its removal as quickly as possible reddit prohibits the posting of such content without consent So I guess my main concern here is  could someone get my content taken down by claiming to be me Ive got a question when is rKarmaCourt going to get authorizations to officially judge users with admins full support Reddits Court needs more powerhttpsiimgurcomLwoCTFgifv QualityQuantity httpiimgurcomjxVfjpg Please please please tell me there is something in the works to help the active mod eliminate mods that are squatting in a community I think there should be a better system in place to remove mods that have more time but are less active or not active at all What percent of those  communities are cat subreddits Edit Its at least httpswwwredditcomuserfrubblinessmcats Any plans on undefaulting rpics and rfunny on grounds of acute suckiness please bring back rredditcom I never understood why you guys got rid of it It was nice having a catchall sub for the stuff about reddit that didnt fit anywhere else when are we getting right and left votes So I can get cute failedtoload messages x as often Came for the over  jokes left slightly disappointed What is the benefit of increasing the number of subreddits tenfold and why is that a goal These are welcome changes More mod tools are a key thing for the near future I would love to be able to place two stickies in a sub instead of one The rSpaceBuckets community salutes you Cheers from the southen hemisphere deleted It is my opinion that more often than not it feels like the general purpose of a moderator is to react to trouble reports and otherwise assist in enforcing the rules But the way reddit has things set up it makes the moderators seem like community leaders when in fact enforcing the rules could be all that they are doing As an example rTheForest has  moderators not counting automoderator  are actively using reddit but inactive to the subreddit they moderate in regards to that they havent posted anything to the subreddit in more than half a year two of which are very active DayZ players They could be moderating through the mod panel but regular people cant see this or other forms of moderating activity except through posting patterns In short it appears that  out of  moderators arent participating in the growth of the subreddit just moderating it Another issue that I see is that some redditors are moderating in excess of  subreddits It makes it seems like some people collect moderatorship and are proud of it although I am aware of the fact that some people were named moderator without their approval uJeresig in rJavaScript as a likely example I dont really know before that policy changed I think defining community leaders  contributors as people that both actively participate and moderate in a subreddit would be a better indicator and contributor towards the health and growth of a subreddit tldr Moderators arent necessarily growers of communities Redditors that actively participate in subreddits moderators or not should be noted Also this whole post would make for an interesting rDataIsBeautiful visualization Take all subreddits that have  posts and destroy them Take all subreddits that have not been active in a year with  posts and destroy them Has this been looked at or a plan been suggested already Please point me in the direction of that conversation Otherwise please do this Subreddits existing for x months with absolutely no posts whatsoever dont need to continue taking up the namespace Whats the definition of active communities Im guessing theres likely far more than  created subreddits so by choosing active communities youre giving a more honest measure  which is good Just curious what the parameters are for that because Im a numbers nerd and Im curious We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment Is that actually a thing Ive never heard of that So where is the master list of subreddits What is the point of growing all of these communities if you have to rely on word of mouth to find them I finally know uweffeys name Growing communities as long as they arent about anything controversial otherwise they get summarily banned when they start showing up on the front page Can you give some more detail on how the policy change will work in practice It sounds good in theory but could I for example get any sexual or nude picture I happen to dislike taken down just by claiming it depicts me Edit uknthing said elsewherehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsxgvfromtocommunitiesnowtakingstepstocowxnrcontext  So I guess my main concern here is  could someone get my content taken down by claiming to be me  No We investigate every request I recently requested a control of a subreddit in rredditrequest that was denied A fellow mod at rfantasyfootball requested control of another sub and was also denied We were both told that the mod was active on the site recently But in both our cases the person in question had no comments submission or virtually any attempt to better the subreddit they were sitting on Is this archaic policy going to be changed at any point We are both very active mods and are trying to improve the site but being denied because someone upvoted a cat picture one time  weeks ago deleted Maybe a search where you can filter your search to subreddits on the particular subject So the gals that made reddit gift exchanges are now running the show Awesome Congrats uweffey and udays Is this the thing ucupcake was making httpwwwredditcomrmodnewscommentsosimoderatorsimthinkingaboutstartingamod God I hate corporatespeak Wow Im terribly late to this so I wont be surprised if this gets ignored Dont you think you need to address the fact that old content is incredibly difficult to access on reddit Now I get that improving search is a difficult task and most advanced users use google site search anyway but Im astounded by how difficult it is to access my own old comments Any user whos made more than a couple of thousand comments is going to face the same problem Your privacy policy states that my comments will not be deleted if I delete my account just unlinked from my username This means to completely erase my comments or check if I accidentally exposed personal information in the past I have to find each of them individually Even that wouldve been okay had it not been for the fact that you make it impossible to do so My account only lists the last  comments when sorted by date and that number will maybe rise to  or  with top hot and controversial there will be overlap If I have more comments than that Ill have to use google which completely ignores some of the smaller threads Any method other than that such as a timestamp search or a sitedump is way beyond the feasibility of a regular user And that means if youre an old heavy user there will be comments on reddit that you will never be able to erase Furthermore those comments are essentially public and possibly accessible by rd party bots and scrapers as well as the reddit admins Say what you want that sounds worse than Facebook or Twitter Both of those Machiavellian services allow you to access an archive of your data to determine if there is content youd like to remove People flame those services on reddit every day despite the fact that reddits own privacy philosophy seems to be shakier when it comes to giving users control over their own content I firmly believe you have to do something about this before you try to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy Please dont stand behind the cliched reply of database and framework constraints And if you do please dont brag about your privacy policy deleted How about letting us see the updown vote counters again Instead of the   The majority of the users didnt like that change But what is reddit doing to improve the current communities Lately weve seen a lot of problem with biased mods censoring discussion on subs Usernotes for mods please  I would literally cry I wonder roughly how long it would take before someone found out that there was a naked picture of themselves on reddit without their permission Like how do you come across that and how many thousands of people have seen it before you realise or are informed Dont get me wrong taking it down after a request is awesome I just wonder how much exposure excuse the pun there is before it gets that far Reddit now with x the downtime  Id like there to be better ways to promote new subreddits perhaps in small text at the top of pages like trending subreddits I had a pretty good idea for a sub but after posting around in a few places to advertise and pming a few mods of bigger subs for help I got  subscriber who has yet to post or upvote anything Basically its very difficult to get your new subreddits shown to people and Id like a way for this to happen without having to spam other people As more subs get created this will only get harder too its a shame For goodness sake can we have a codified rule set The rules at the moment are extremely catch all and allow for the banning of pretty much anyone imo For example vote brigading isnt defined anywhere in the rules Its barely even mentioned I love that there are so many different communities here its basically my one stop shop for all the things that interest me What if anything is being done about abusive power mods that hold too much power and dont care much for open discussion Please for the love of god focus on getting the basics right before you try any expansion  Reddit is down a lot its  people expect websites to be up  of the time  Please fix functionality of the website the search bar is a joke and mod mail is just awful  Get better at communicating to your audience You guys suck at this like a lot Laughable comms pieces Everyman is responsible for his own soulhttpwwwredditcomrblogcommentsfoivoeverymanisresponsibleforhisownsoul and  Stop being so unprofessional seriously like listing why an ex employ was fired publically on a reddit threadhttpwwwquoracomWhatdoRedditemployeesthinkofYishanscommentsontheirfiredexemployee what sort of company does that Any plans for protecting communities from mods There are some communities that feel like they are kept captive by their mods see popular posts deleted users banned capriciously etc Are there any plans to protect users from these kinds of things Thank you for providing us with such a great community My life has been significantly enriched by the people Ive met and experiences Ive had because of this site  Questions I forget where but someone noted a statistic that there was a large gap in subscribers It goes from k to  million subscribers with no subreddits in between How do you hope to address this and the corresponding breakage of subreddit rules and community unwritten norms that occurs How will you give tools to moderators when their subreddits blow up It can be hard to get qualified moderators in a pinch especially if its in a highly specialized subreddit like rlaw raskscience or rcasualllama Also welcome back from being Admin Emeritus What does this mean for subreddits that share unauthorized images of people either sexually explicit or violent in nature that we know exist right now Will they be banned I cant wait to see how the new mod tools come about As a moderator of two smallmedium sized subs rhookah and rEVEX it can be difficult keeping up with mail and the mod queue sometimes I can only imagine how the mods of subs with  million subscribers must feel I love the idea of mod tutorials too Do you guys plan on highlighting these on the site when someone creates a new community Because I think that would be a great idea maybe a piece of modmail sent to the new subreddit owner when one is created Maybe Im slow to notice but Ive just recently figured out that reddit is in a similar position to where Google and Facebook were some years ago  and is possibly on the brink of complete world domination I mean that once upon a time there were many search engines now there is one de facto There were many social networks now there is one likewise There are many news aggregation sites which allow comments but reddit has been around longer has developed itself slowly and organically and is not limited by content  by that I mean there are an infinite number of possible subreddits of increasing specialisation or oddity Google is fine for finding news stories Facebook is fine for sharingdiscussing with friends but reddit throws the whole thing open to the world  without drowning in a sea of YouTube comments moderators can see to that There was a time when everyone ie early adopters had their own unique webpage with their details stories photos accomplishments etc Now those have been homogenised into Facebook profiles  you dont really need your own personal dot com any more Similarly I can see all the specialist forums BBS and alt usenet groups and their modern equivalents gradually being replaced by subreddits Reddit has gone from th to th on Alexa in the last three months I can see it becoming a true cornerstone of the net much like Wikipedia in the near future tldr this site has been going to hell since the Digg exodus of  Well first stop deleting stuff like post about the reddit ceo Keep this place open to free speech and we will continue to buy gold and support you Please dont go the way of digg  I dont know why but i just subscribed to rgoats Rule r of the Internet Id it exists there is a reddit for it deleted And we still havent unfollowed rfunny I saw the rmodnews post about the mod tutorials first but Ill welcome udays and uweffey to the admin team again here   No matter who you are if a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity sexual excitement or engaged in any act of sexual conduct is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission it is prohibited on reddit We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified As usual the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks on March   Good stuff OVER  Pretty fucking hard to do when youre too busy banning anything that doesnt conform to your ideology driven mods and Pao Good fucking work I hope your fucking site fails Well I get the general feel of it but do we want  communities Already there are too many sub teddies that dont actually do anything which is fine but reddit would improve from some streamlining I think Interesting to see admin become more hands on Not sure if that is a good thing overall but I guess it was inevitable Are you going to hire more community managers It seems like a pretty thankless job but some of the most visible admins CupcakeDeimorzAlienth are gone now as admins edit brainfart Regarding the privacy policy changes Ive heard from friends that in the past it was challenge to get any admin response to address removal of images Will there be a dedicated team andor formalized process to help users going forward Also thanks for all you guys do Reddit has been a big and hugely positive part of my life the last couple of years Thanks again When I was born there were  planets We now know there are over  planets nah i hate people Ive lost interest in all the overmodded subreddits which seems like pretty much all of them It seems there are no basictopic subreddits that you can post a question to the community Ive tried posting honest legitimate questions in the past and had virtually every single one of them deleted by a mod For me this destroys the credibility of the subreddits and the credibility of reddit as a whole You should either use the voting community or dont use it You either believe in the reddit system or you dont Right now its sort of a hybrid with around  community influence and  mod influence The only posts we ever see are the  or so ones that are handpicked by the mods Thats not a forum thats a modded topic lottery with very few winners and a system that shows complete disrespect and disdain to the people who take the time to compose something to post The only modding that should ever be allowed is if the post is mostly  miscategorized or insincere Any modding beyond that completely defeats the system rendering it useless This site does not need more shitty mods Wait so if someone posts a pic of themselves and theyre cross posted on rfatpeoplehate hate will that be subject to a ban then under the new privacy policy Because Ive seen instances of this happening before and its awful Its bullying  The transparency report was an interesting step as far as Digital Privacy is concerned How do you think the new Privacy Policy will affect the next ones numbers Could you guys work on improving notifications via the official reddit app Maybe I am just getting old but whats the difference between a subreddit and a community The number of subscribers I fail to see how rgoats is a niche community Thank you for letting me know rgoats existed In addition to reporting on takedowns when do you plan to change policy to respond only to valid takedowns How about improving your Ad system You know like actually let us pause a campaign instead of PM or email someone and have to wait X amount of hours The current ad system is very shitty Any decent backend programmer could add the pause functionally within a week What exactly are you sillyheads doing with all of that VC  besides not paying decent programmers Instead of tutorials for new moderators could you please make it easier for us mods to get rid of vanity mods who are active on reddit but do absolutely nothing for the communities they moderate I really dont like the idea of the nearly two years of hard work Ive put into my community potentially being undone because someone who has been AWOL for  years but outranks me suddenly decides they want to reclaim their subreddit As reddit grows this is only becoming more of a problem and I feel like the current rules and methods need to be changed as soon as possible Does this mean youre going to buy a second server marketing platform Protecting Your Digital Privacy unless the feds ask even without a warrent Im late to the party so I dont know if youll see this suggestion but as a mod of a decent size community with a good sense of community rCFB I implore your team to do a better job of explaining to the public what reddit is a group of communities not a monolith When a small group causes a mess on Facebook no one attributes it to Facebook however when some small group does something really dumb in some corner of reddit the press and even our own community blames reddit The site is far too big for that to work anymore Its silly that subs like rCFB or rNFL should worry about what some idiots do with personal photos of celebrities or the racist subs I know what I suggest would involve a concerted PR effort by reddits core team at HQ and might not be entirely feasible However I did want to just put that suggestion out there if only to give myself peace of mind Thanks for reading and thanks for keeping this site going Can we get a percentage on how many of those communities involve porn How will this affect communities like rCandidFashionPolice and others whose focus requires the posting of photos without consent Will they be removed No matter who you are if a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity sexual excitement or engaged in any act of sexual conduct is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission it is prohibited on reddit We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified  So proud of Reddit today looks like one of the new hires who was supposed to help grow communities is instead going on a witch hunt banning communities i wonder if rironic is a sub Bring back FPH Stop censoring the media You guys need to handle your performance problems before you try to expand I get a lot of s and We took too long to make this for you errors every day Can you comment on the high levels of Reddit censorship that has been occuring as of the last  months Many big stories that have positive scores in the thousands somehow mysteriously disapear Can this be explainedjustified in anyway or should we remain worried With ever decreasing quality of subreddits weve decided that we need x more Up with quantity down with quality This is the new monetized reddit No matter who you are if a photograph video or digital image of you in a state of nudity sexual excitement or engaged in any act of sexual conduct is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission it is prohibited on reddit So are you nuking rcelebnsfw Lol You guys are banning communities I go to concert Does ten times more communities mean that the Reddit servers will fall over ten times as often Because then Reddit would only have about  uptime  deleted Hey Alexis Thanks for this I know you have a million names on your site over that and you probably dont know mine too well but this is just making me smile Ive consistently been the saltiest person I know about many changes on reddit more than Peter Dager or the Grinch It was so painful for me to watch you guys put the resources into so many unneeded things things the community never even asked for Cool ideas for sure but simply misguided Ever since your return I see that you guys have been working hard to fix the mistakes of the past and to focus more on reddit which without it wouldnt let you do the other cool things So thank you for this update and thank you for putting that care and devotion into reddit itself Theres a major problem with the app one which Im sure theyve realised and going to remedy soon you cant see parent comments So there are a lot of questions like Q And what did you think of him A Hes great And we have no way of knowing who theyre talking about We need to be able to see the parent comment Thanks  Hope the pictures will be accurate this timehttpiimgurcomqjJPHvHjpg I asked in the last thread and the admins never replied Redditcom itself is open source Will you be open sourcing the android and ios apps deleted Why is there need for a seperate app for AMA When will we get an official reddit app Just downloaded the app It looks great and works pretty well so far only thing I can say is it goes back to the top of the list every time I back out of an ama so I have to manually scroll dont and find my place I know its sort of a petty concern but I figured Id give some constructive criticism I am a subreddit AMA Ive noticed that it only shows the question and the answer to the question It doesnt go deeper uchooter Victorias ama today demonstrated that she went fairly deep into counter replies and comments but with this app we cant see them Is it a setting Im missing Otherwise this thing is gorgeous UI is beautiful What about releasing a downvote counter Lold hard at the first  star review Only has AMAs followed about his wife biting people or something Woot Also icymihttpswwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsfgsviamvictoriafromredditamaa Im still answering questions in support of the app too AndWindows Phone Please  Huh Interesting Can someone explain to me however the difference between this and say Bacon Reader or Alien Blue Bug Summary The app icon does not follow the reddit brandingmarketing paradigm Steps to reproduce  Install app on android device  Look at app icon UX Tester Note wtf End bug report Since youre developing this is there a chance youll make an official reddit app for android Very slick interface kudos My main suggestion would be that it needs a night mode I like it for the most part I think the answered post on the current AMA with Sarah Chalke as the second guest points to an issue with any AMA with multiple guests Theres only one OP Is there any way to use flair to tag the other guests for the app for the answered category I have become a fan of reddit in just  min of registering The way they are stacked I cant tell if the AMAer is replying to an original comment or a reply to their comment Id add something to differentiate replies from original comments Nearly got snow blindness  How to change to dark theme Material design Very goood Will night mode be an option in the future Why does the app need my device id and call information I see no reason for it Downloading it now Cant wait to check it out Thanks for releasing it so quickly for android as well Le reddit army has arrived It looks very nice The thing I dont like is when I hit the back button after reading a post it reloads and takes me back to the top Then I have to scroll back down to where I was As one of the s of us on Blackberry  I will wait patiently for our AMA app Tsk What does the AMA queen have to say about this httpwwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsfgsviamvictoriafromredditamaackpw Id be less offended if you asked for my data You should do an AMA about it What a time to be alive This app seems pointless to me You need nothing but Reddit to do an AMA What am I missing that this app offers So we get an AMA app but no official reddit browsing app I feel dirty for opening this on reddit is fun tried it in beta hate it completely useless make a reddit app not a ama app Great But Ive wondered for a long time Why is there no official reddit browsing app Are the third party apps made by anyone at reddit It just seems so strange that theres still no official version after this site has emerged as a popular place online Reddit is fun works just fine thanks though All we need now is an official client release Will the upcoming AMAs list be added in a future update My biggest problem is I have a hard time keeping track of when AMAs are going to happen Cant wait for the Windows phone one Oh wait And Im just sittin here iPhonin I downloaded the app and I agree that it is a very beautiful setup Thanks for getting it out on Android so quickly One of my only issues with it so far is that on AMAs with two people you can only see the OPs replies and not the second persons like with Jay Chandrasekhar and Sarah Chalke Some kind of solution that flags the second person as relevant to the AMA would be lovely THANK YOU reddit for creating an android application that runs smoothly on BlackBerry  right out of the box We dont ask for much and there are still millions of us We will use it gladly Hey we would really appreciate this app on Windows Phone And an official Reddit app please Awesome Im gonna get this right awa  Requires iOS  or later Nevermind Are they ever going to make an official Reddit app Could someone ELI why theres an AMA App but not a real app Zzzzz It has an option called AMA notifications that i suppose it should notify you when there is a new AMA I did not receive anything since i installed it two days now I dont want to use it Good work guys Also a moderator app would make sooooo many people happy Comment for two karma This is my first post A test Any chance a for an official gw app Fuck yeah Its a great app too congrats on getting it out That was fast I was expecting to wait a lot longer How about an official reddit app instead of one just for ama Time to test this thing out You delivered in great time at that Yay iPad This actually looksworks pretty good Are there any plans to release an official Reddit app for Android Why does this exist yet an official full reddit app does not There are like  more reddit apps I think that the AMAadvertising part of reddit is driving it in the wrong direction Is it wrong of me to think that As reddit increases ever more in popularity it attract the masses but by doing this I feel it have lost sight of its roots By driving traffic with celebrity AMAS and pictures of jokes from TV shows we lower the value I have of reddit as a place to learn new things In  USC showed that learning new things can cause opioid release in your brain learning is addictive As reddit becomes filled with easy to digest picture content that is so rarely original or funny even it becomes just another buzzfeed spamblog I value reddit but not for this Does that make me wrong Should I not voice my opinion when these issues come up deleted How do I turn these gayass announcements off Lol HERES AN APP THAT ONLY HAS ONE SUBREDDIT THAT GIVES US THE MOST EXPOSURE DONT FORGET TO SEE HOW THE CELEBS ANSWER WHICH TYPE OF DUCK THEYLL FIGHT Why do i need this app Reddit Is Fun does everything i need it to A large picture on every link isnt important to me will it unban you too If so Id like a raskreddit app Awesome Thank you based admins Will this ever have support for the other AMA subreddit rAMA or will this just be for riama I checked it out and its nice but Id rather have just one app for all my Reddit needs I think Ill stick with Alien Blue until maybe an official Reddit app comes out with the goodies of this AMA app implemented into it Well done The app is beautiful Excellent thank you I genuinely might not get it because Reddit is Fun was so great I might just test it and stick with what I have This would be amazing if it had all of reddit the app is amazing Woo And indeed hoo I would love to see an official reddit app that looks this good Its beautiful AMA has come a long way I guess since the whole were shutting AMA down fiasco Would be cool if there was a AMA APP trophy Installed it  used it looks cleanbut no reward for it Im salivating here Whats it do Im glad reddit is looking more serious and attractive to people however I wish the whole site received special treatment official mobile app instead of just AMA Work your RSS magic plz The app doesnt work on my  Huawei Ascent mate with Android  The apps starts and it says Upcomming AMA and then i get the error that Reddit AMA has stopped working I have filled in the crash report hope this will be fixed soon Love the app but is there a way to filter to Active AMAs only Thomas needs to learn to fair catch Two bad special teams plays Does it have offline caching am I the only one who noticed the font change on the subreddit shortcut bar When will we get a good Reddit app for Windows phone This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit  rAndroid The official reddit AMA app has been released on AndroidhttpnpredditcomrAndroidcommentsfietheofficialredditamaapphasbeenreleasedon If you follow any of the above links respect the rules of reddit and dont vote or comment Questions Abuse Message me herehttpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoFrFmetabotmailbag Nice Good job This isreally not what I expected from a design perspective In a good way Looks great looks clean and looks to follow Android guidelines pretty well Great work can we expect an android reddit app Im kinda sad that I missed the chance to help with the beta  What is the point in this Love the design looks awesome i cant comment on it and will there be a schedulecalender feature added edit oh comment on active posts only got it Will there be a regular official reddit app as well Or was this AMA app what the whole hullabaloo was about There should be an icon to identify active on break or finished AMAs that way a person could only see the ones that still are being answered Windows Phone version please By the way thanks for adding that report thing I suggested Whenever I open the app it just keeps loading and never shows any AMAs My internet connection is fine I downloaded the app right so what gives Anyone else Why do I keep on seeing posts from this subreddit I un subscribed for a reason As others have mentioned and having tried it I also do not understand why this is better than the other Reddit clients out there Could we get a schedule of upcoming AMAs It would be nice to know who is upcoming Notifications would be a bonus too Aaaaalright Wooo Now About Windows Phone Any word on putting this on WP Maybe an option to change the font of the text Sorry I only read things covered in bacon now Feed back I was  pages deep went in an ama and hit back when I was done and it took me back to page  Drives me nuts when apps lose my spot att note  I dont see how to post a question using the app Nice logo Keep your designer Pay him more Buy him an island If there was a reddit made app for the whole shebang that looked like this I would use it Possibly even pay Sorry reddit is fun I cant seem to find any option to ask a question in an ama Is this strictly a reader I should update my  soon Its lasted a while but its starting to look beaten up Why would you make an app just for AMA What about Windows Phone Hang on so I cant partisipate in tbe ama but i can vote and read the ama with context issues ok ill stick to the web site for now Love the readability Good job Also say thanks to Veronica for me Her AMAA was awesome Where the fuck is the Windows one then Go fuck yourselves reddit shills Is there a sidebar with an upcoming schedule that Im not seeing Thank you for this the app is beautiful  So after scrolling down in an attwmpt to find a thread im interested in i then click on it However every time I click back after reading an ama the page goes all the way back to the beginning top of the page and I have to scroll all the way down again Please fix this Otherwise its a freaking awesome app Thanks  It only supports AMA Why And what is the advantage of this over a rd party app that lets me read anything Can a future update include the ability to open links ie imgur internally Its a bit annoying clicking on a link and being redirected to google chrome then having to swap back to the app Eh Ill just stick to reddit is fun I like the subtle triforce in the app logo While I agree AMAs are hard to follow and a system dedicated to it is helpful am I the only one who finds it incredibly lazy to release this when you cant even manage an official app for you know your actual site Looks great but I do have one complaint When there is an AMA with multiple accounts answering such as this onehttpwwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsfhyshiamjaychandrasekharjoinedbysarahchalke on rIAmA right now you can only see responses from the OP Hey everyone Please head over to the shiny new subreddit to discuss this post and ask questions Cheers EDIT Thanks for the silver  EDIT  point takenhttpsiredditmaflhotwxugpng Will this break the back button I was a regular on the Straight Dope forums when they tried to monetize it by introducing viglinks It was a crap move Its not the concept I object to its that viglinks servers absolutely fucking suck Links between the forum site and most external sites were essentially disabled due to poor performance I sincerely hope they up their game for reddit  Weve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they wont store user data or cookies during this process Does this mean that they wont store data during the testing phase or does it mean that they wont store data during the redirect process ever Does the affiliateinsertion extend to third party apps Ie the API Just curious You said the outgoing links are to HTTPS Do you meant the link that Reddit forwards to or the link that Viglink forwards to or both I take it this will operate like Google When I mouseover a search result it shows the normal URL but as soon as I leftclick or rightclick it it gets replaced by a Google redirect I assume so it can track clicks However this pisses me off sometimes when I want the URL This is when the site is down or for some reason the google redirect fails the site itself redirects somewhere else and I want the original URL or I want to recordshare the URL without having to click through to the site Basically Im ok with it doing the JavaScript URL replacement when leftclicking but when I pull up the rightclick context menu to access Save Link As or Copy Link Location itd be nice if that stayed the original nonredirected URL If I press the back arrow would I get sent back to Reddit or be stuck on the infinite redirect page When Ive seen viglinks used on a forum before it replaced some of my words with links to products associated with those words So if I said chair it would add a link to a furniture store to chair Unfortunately there was no clear determination between paid ads and user links It basically made me think any link anyone provided was an ad Will this be how this works deleted When you say will this work with my adblocker do you mean adblocker will prevent rewriting the url to a VigLink redirect and I still get to the site Id love to tell people to use Adblocker instead of requesting less appropriate tools add support for this I dont think replace all affiliate links is good wording for the user prefs since thats the opposite of whats happening existing affiliate links are the only ones not being replaced Turn links into Reddit affiliate links would be a lot clearer The Reddit user agreement says  reddit is a place with many thirdparty hyperlinks posted by users like you We are not responsible for the content or actions of any third party websites or services associated with posted links You agree to take sole legal responsibility for any links you post and neither this agreement nor our privacy policy applies to any content on other websites related to those links You should consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your rights Does VL and the site VL decides to redirect us to count as being related to the original link and thus is it our legal responsibility or yours Does VL lie inside or outside our user agreement and your privacy policy If the final site behaves differently on seeing it is referred from VL whose responsibility is that Will there be a way to strip the affiliate portion of links others post deleted So this basically just gives Reddit the credit for some of the ad revenue sites get from traffic directed towards them from here Im not totally clear on what this is exactly As long as its not a redirect like Certain sites of illrepute use I might be OK with it Does opting out mean links in comments I post dont get affiliated or that I wont see any affiliated links across the site Its important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist So is the gold goal we see on the sidebar not effective enough Should it be higher About what percent of operating costs are covered by reddit gold And I probably already know the answer ustarfishjenga but is there any plan to allow entire subreddits to opt out rather than individual users Can you please provide an example link Why not test this with the rbeta subscribers only Are you going to announce when the change occurs for the entire userbase Who are the  merchants The link displayed on hover will match the original link Clicking will forward users through a thirdparty service Thats not nice I want to know what Im clicking on and not worry about malware or something  The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link The link displayed on hover will match the original link Clicking will forward users through a thirdparty service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination Modifying links onclick like this is a bad thing and I expect browsers to start clamping down on it Further you are modifying the content that a user provides and whilst the user agreement allows you to make derivative works you are doing so whilst having the work appear to be that of the original author Further to this altering of content does this mean that the text regarding links and reddithttpswwwredditcomwikiuseragreementwikilinksandreddit no longer applies because reddit now assumes responsibility for those lonks having altered them deleted Viglink is a shady organization The fact that you apparently knew that but still did business with them is troubling As is the fact that you keep calling these Reddit Affiliate links when they are Viglink as if youre trying to hide it I know from the Straight Dope Messsageboard that even when you tell them not to Viglink will take links to one site and change them to links to another site where the price is higher so theyll get a better deal Any organization that would do that is not worth risking There are ways to do things that are not very detectable partnering with a shadow company You get the info send it off then delete it I am very disappointed in this I have now decided to completely adblock Reddit until you stop trying to keep shady organizations like Viglink afloat There are other things you could do but you chose to make a deal with the devil deleted When you say  merchants does this essentially mean a selection of different online stores So if someone links a tshirt design for example this feature may swap out an affiliate link in place of the original posted URL Also props for the optout Thatll probably save you from a public lynching The kneejerk reaction is to get upset at some perceived overreach by Reddit but at the same time It isnt costing me anything and it helps fund a website that I enjoy I am willing to be persuaded that this is better or worse than I thought but for the most part sounds like Reddit is doing what Reddit needs to do to be able to continue to provide us with a service that most of us are not willing to pay for  The link displayed on hover will match the original link This is the part of this that I like the least I dont really mind redirects when I know they are happening but hijacking the browsers status bar to display a link that you are actively not sending them to is evil Does anyone know if there is a Chrome plugin that blocks this behavior without destroying legitimate javascript Or are there other browsers that prevent linkjacking attempts  all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled replace all affiliate links Please introduce this option to everyone before rolling this change out for everyone Or at least show a notice akin to firefoxs Firefox automatically sends some data to Mozilla so that we can improve your experience Choose What I Share where dismissing it enables the default privacy settings What does this mean for the common user who has no idea what affiliate links are let alone redirection I run a script blocker Will anything change for me How can we verify that the redirects are not malicious Do you anticipate a rise in malicious redirect links being posted because this policy will normalize the occurrence Can I as a mod optout my sub from either the beta or the final deployment Will there be revshare with the users who are posting said links A general rule of thumb ive come across is that any subreddit that has allowed affilate links theres a better one without them Any time affiliate links are involved things get shady and seem far more seedy I hope this wont be the case with reddit If I understand properly Reddit links go to wherever the person posting linked to however it goes through this third party site to create a unique referral link code Destination website sees this code from Reddit pays Reddit a percentage of revenue based on traffic driven to the site from Reddit Does not track me store cookies or in any way identify me personally only that the traffic is coming from Reddit Could anyone Eli how this works Like what is the process between clicking the link and arriving at the intended web page The only thing I feel slightly wary about is not being able to see the link before I click it What guarantees do we have that Vigilink cannot or will not serve malware In particular are there any guarantees that Vigilink wont serve rd party executable content eg JavaScript Flash Java etc from sources other than Vigilink Malvertising is an enormous problem especially with the modern trend towards realtime bidding I use Amazon Smile for a charity currently Will this take a separate cut of whatever money is earmarked for charitiessites or will this take the whole piece Im not a fan of viglinks as its used in ProBoard Theres a slight lag as the link goes to the referrer link first and copy pasting links means visiting the page though the referrer to actually get a URL This is going to suck Are you hosting the javascript thats being injected or is Vigilink For instance if I wanted to whitelist reddits real estate using noscript would the affiliate injection happen or is the javascript hosted and served by Vigilink What are you doing to make sure that this wont turn into a security issue Modifying links as a user clicks them sounds a lot like clickjackinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiClickjacking It wouldnt take much for this linkrewriting capability to be used misused Secondly if a user copies one of the product links will the affiliate value be injected into the clipboard version as well If so doesnt that mean that whoever the user shares the link with no longer has a method of opting out Isnt this completely against FTC guidelineshttpswwwftcgovtipsadvicebusinesscenterguidanceftcsendorsementguideswhatpeopleareaskingaffiliate Obviously IANAL and dont know if reddit is following these guidelines to the letter but it seems really disingenuous to get paid money off the backs of other users links without disclosing it for every instance Is the option to opt out available now If not is there any way to opt out before the change is made If I am part of the small percentage of users will I be informed  Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled replace all affiliate links Will affected users be informed they are part of the test phase And if so will the optout be mentioned in the notification Isnt this kind of an abuse of the whole affiliate system The affiliate system is there to encourage crosssite advertizing by giving credit to those who put up advertising to others sites However with reddit it is the users who put up the advertizing and reddit that gets the credit Fairness to the users aside there might be something to be said about that but that isnt my point the the sellers are giving money to you for making a decision ie deciding to put up a link that you didnt actually do Rather you are just piggybacking to get some credit for others volunteer work So they are pretty much paying you for nothing Are they fine with this Weve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they wont store user data or cookies during this process If no user data or cookies are stored THEN WHY ARE LINKS BEING REDIRECTED You redirect a link so you can place a cookie on the user and when the user with the cookie makes a purchase the affiliate gets credit Affiliate links  You are redirected for the exact purpose of trackinghttpwwwaffiliatewizcomAffiliateMarketingResourcesaffiliatetrackingsoftwarebasicsasp What happens if viglink servers go down How do you opt out Im kind of late to the party but I didnt see this answered anywhere and I think its important Will the fact that a post or comment contains a monetizable link impact its ranking in the algorithm now or in the future What happens ifwhen the partnership ends Will the old links be redirected to a server that no longer exists breaking old posts Ive never heard of Viglink What do they get out of this does Reddit pay to use their service Or do they collect data from the user and sell it This is the beginning of the end Maybe its the end of the end Whatever Im going back to Digg deleted What kind of safe guards will there be to prevent malicious use of these redirects A community this size is a very tempting target for MitM attacks and theres no way for Reddit to  verify Viglinks own security If I use a custom HOSTS file as my adblocking system MVPS and it blocks VigLink connected domains will it prevent me from going to the source link If viglink goes offline for someany reason will it break reddits ability to redirect Its unclear if the option needs to be checked or unchecked The FAQ just says to toggle the option replace affiliate links Does checking replace affiliate links opt me in or out  EDIT additional FAQ  Can I get an ELI When you click on a link to some k online stores Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase If you dont like this you can opt out via the user preference labeled replace affiliate links Well Ive gone ahead and disabled the option as I believe it will rob many small website and blog owners of their reward Majority of affiliate programs reward the commission to the last click meaning that a click from Reddit will override the affiliate tracking from a previous lead on some poor guys or gals websiteblog This is a real dick move but perhaps this will be a wakeup call for those who run the affiliate programs to finally adopt a first click attribution model as standard as Im sure they will be receiving a lot more backlash over it going forward I cant quite figure out what you mean  can you give me an example of what this will look like in practice What about security A rd party opens the door to tons of possible infection oppertunities deleted I understand this is a private website but damn Imagine if Comcast just said you know what All those links Those are now affiliate links that are paid to us Also does the FTC handle affiliate link redirects without disclosure How is this handled if noscript addon is enabled FYI replace all affiliate links is actually replace affiliate links the page you linked FAQ is incorrect Also in preferences replace affiliate links needs expository text as most users have no idea what this means So if the option is checked in Preferences are you optin or optout The wording of the setting is very confusing I feel like an idiot for needing to ask but should I check or uncheck Replace all affiliate links to optout The FAQ says to toggle Replace all affiliate links but when I check my account settings its already toggled checked Is this going to be an optin service or optout I think this is a solid plan to monetize Reddit but Id prefer you just change the URL of links I can see how that would be challenging but Id feel safer knowing exactly where the link is sending me I have no trust in redirect sites even if they state that they arent keeping logs Finally is there a list of merchantssites which will be redirected to an affiliate link and will there be any sort of notificationonhover ie when we mouseover the link to see the site will it be a different color for affiliate links or have any noticeable change to signal that were clicking an affiliate link There are certain sites that I use to support specific content creators or websites and I dont want those to be overwritten so having the list even if its huge would be a big help Thanks for the hard work Whatever your answers I appreciate the notice deleted The beginning of the end Will these affiliate links be labeled as such in a way that a common user knows what is going on As are many people I am worried about the native advertising anglehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvEFGxCwizc I understand that this is an edge case but I think just a simple notification after each link linking to a post explaining what affiliate links are and how this all works would discharge my concern Not a fan or even a remote supporter of this feature It seems like yet another pathetic cash grab by reddit administration This seems like a reasonable enough idea in the abstract but  The link displayed on hover will match the original link I hate that part Why not be honest about where the link Im about to click on actually points Scumbag move I often want to copy a link directly without any bullshit and Im often behind proxies that block this sort of garbage The VigLink privacy policy httpwwwviglinkcomlegalprivacy directly contradicts your posted statement Per the discrepancy which terms are in effect Your statement constitutes a legal contract but so does the policy on VigLinks website One explicitly breaches the other You are now changing the links people post Not cool at all The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link The link displayed on hover will match the original link This kind of redirect is malicious  it will be rewritten so that youre redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made This should actually be illegal this is spyware type crap and you actually are setting it up so that users see the real link and dont realize that if they click they are redirected to a scammy rd party Viglink is not an affiliate link An affiliate link is adding something like a to the link while the link only goes to the store itself Rewriting links to send you to a completely different website is insane I hope google delists you for having fake links in all your content that are changed via javascript that google doesnt see when they cache your page This kind of thing should be optin only So every link I click will be routed via a rd party first And the rerouting is done in secret link preview shows no rerouting Mmmm Not really the game Im liking deleted This is a bad idea A lot of subs dont allow us to post our own affiliate links because of spam issues and youre effectively forcing us to act as your affiliate army instead of benefiting us at all This is misleading at best Unbeknownst to the user they are being passed through a thirdparty called VigLink given a cookie and having their IP address and other details logged and passed to other companies As you pass through their site you are subject to their policies and marketing ustarfishjenga has said Reddit userdata is exempt from this but this is for items like your email address The page you came from the page you are going to and it certainly cookies are being added by Viglink to your browser and shared with other sites advertisers and marketing companies The user wont know about it especially since Reddit are going to clickjack the link so unless you examine the Javascript or you read this then youd have no idea this was happening HOVERING OVER THE LINK WILL TELL YOU NOTHING AT ALL Originally it wasnt even going to be put in the Terms or Privacy Policy either  If ustarfishjenga would like to answer this how are their legal terms and conditions are invalidated for Reddit users To what extent What threshold causes users to have to agree to it Does visiting their site change this How will Reddit stop them storing user cookies I asked you a week ago  and you stopped responding  Viglinks Privacy Policyhttpwwwviglinkcomlegalprivacy is fairly clear If you have any concerns I suggest users read it or block their site I assume were meant to agree to this without having seen it linked anywhere officially in Reddit TCs  When you interact with us through the Site we receive and store certain additional personally nonidentifiable information Such information which is collected passively using various technologies   Examples include IP addresses browser types domain names and other anonymous statistical data    We may use personally nonidentifiable information and pool it with other information to track   VigLink  may use firstparty cookies  and thirdparty cookies together to inform optimize and serve ads on sites across the Internet based on someones past visits to the VigLink website These ads often referred to as remarketing may be personalized using information inferred from their behavior when visiting VigLinks website  TLDR sorry for length Reddit might not be providing our details directly but by masquerading and clickjacking links they are sending all of us through a thirdparty site who is collecting our IP address and other data They are also using this data to see which sites have people have gone to and storing cookies to be able to connect these visits together Despite not having personal information such as email addresses this is still tracking data and we are agreeing that this is being shared with thirdparties  Things have changed at Reddit Its not some friendly site Its all about your data and the profit that can be made from it Do remember that this is just days after the rpolitics censorship  where Reddit admins asked their mods to remove posts Im not sure this is a good direction ustarfishjenga Even if that is compensated by a few cents coming in from people linking to eBay I really hope Reddit will reconsider Isnt this in essence hurting merchants who would have otherwise gotten the sale without the hit to their margin from the affiliate commission As someone knowledgeable in the space this is essentially the parasitic behaviour of a low quality affiliate Reddit isnt adding anything to the sales process that would have occurred without them I know you guys want bonuses but do you really need to launch a man in the middle attack Once you start hijacking links to earn money how can we ever trust you again You have an incentive to manipulate post rankings in order to make more money Suddenly posts that use affiliate links will reach all for the first time ever because everyone knows we love content like that Comments that mention specific products will also leap to the top coincidentally It definitely wont be anything to do with this though Yeah but what about SRS Your optout text is highly confusing Is this on purpose Enable affiliate links Does checking this opt me in or out Am I enabling the replacement of links with your own affiliate ones Or not enabling Whats wrong with Replace links with Reddit affiliate links Could you keep track of revenue generated per subreddit and allow each subreddit to pick a charity probably from a fixed list to receive a percentage of the revenue it generates Are you going to provide the list of  merchants Reposting my question from uspezs AMA since it wasnt answered there  I feel like Im missing something here whats in it for the merchants I mean those links are already getting posted and its not Reddit admins that decide when and where they get posted Why would they want to start paying Reddit for them  Users will link to affiliated merchants products and theyll link to unaffiliated merchants products What is the advantage of being an affiliated merchant here Do they get some useful statistics on what sort of people click links Will Reddit find a way to change users behaviour so that more people post or click on affiliated links In other words this sounds like Viglink paying you to just do what youre already doing Whats the catch The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link The link displayed on hover will match the original link Clicking will forward users through a thirdparty service OK so you want to make some money but isnt this implementation basically a shitty way to do it I should be able to trust hovering to not lie to me and not be subject to effectively a bait and switch Why dont you insert and affiliate link alongside the original and make it transparent and honest Doesnt this violate the spirit of referral programs The point is to encourage people to link to certain vendors essentially buying traffic Rewriting existing links that already exist either way provides no benefit to the ecommerce vendor I dont understand why any affiliate program would allow this So the hover shows one URL but youre sending me somewhere else Thats incredibly fucked up replace affiliate links in preferences is poorly worded or explained users coming along after these announcements wont have a clue what it means Just to check for the preference option does checking the box mean they will be replaced to go through Viglink or wont Really glad that the reddit side optout thing is there Wait does replace affiliate links turn them on or off Do I check or uncheck Replace affiliate links to be opted out ustarfishjenga Are you going to notify these users that this is happening because you should Not everyone reads announcements and the use of a third party here is a massive invasion of privacy these links would have previously been unaffiliated links Since they now will be vendors will have a higher cost to deliver the products that we find on reddit and purchase This will only drive the cost down to consumers which is down right dishonest Instead of developing features that will be a detriment to user with slower links not to mention jeopardizing our sacred anonymity They could spend their time developing premium services and opening an optional subscription I pay for lots of digital content and would be happy to add reddit to the list but not if they are going to be scumbags I am opt out for sure EDIT additional FAQ  Can I get an ELI When you click on a link to some k online stores Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase If you dont like this you can opt out via the user preference labeled replace affiliate links Why does this require users to opt out instead of opt in New users wouldnt even be aware of this Ahh the good ol optout of monitizing spam instead of optin just to make a tiny buck Remember when reddit does it its not spam its a business model The link displayed on hover will match the original link Goddamn it Why dont we just get rid of this feature then if everyones just going to lie about where a click will take you Including the opt out was a smart idea Ive been supporting the site by buying reddit gold and Id probably stop if I couldnt turn this off Thank you for letting us know in detail about the changes Kudos for fielding questions addressing concerns and perhaps considering some of the suggestions Overall nice to see a transparent approach to decision making mostly But From Discuss this ad to Users link Reddits money is a big shift in monetization Pros  Latches onto trending monetization strategy versus ads  User generated content makes it easy to scale  Brings  sellers to the ecosystem  Possibly gets Reddit finance from operating costs to profit and hopefully the money goes into making the site perform better before anything else Cons  Could alienate power users  Opening links could be slower  Legal complexities could arise  Privacy and tracking issues could arise  Daily Reddit GOLD goal may become irrelevant Gasp Was there any other option presented to the Reddit community on monetizing the site Maybe Redditors would dig Diamonds some new incentive as much as Gold Or maybe sponsored comments in the first  of a post might be more discrete yet impactful  Hoping Reddit gets the mix right and morphs into a better Reddit this is breaking the rules of half a dozen websites that I know of along with the rules of almost every sub all this is going to do is make reddit a blocked website  Will this work with my adblocker Well time to go find another plugin that can disable this invasive tracking feature That or Ill just rightclick copy then paste URLs I understand you guys need to make a buck but letting some third party track everything users click isnt the way to do it deleted Glad to see you are desperate for money and cant afford to try and preserve what you think your reputation is Get fucked all of you worthless admins I look forward to this hastening collapse of reddit How is this fair to the merchants The purpose of an affiliate is to advertise a product in exchange for a commision what you are doing is hijacking organic nonaffiliate exposure from your users and profiting from it This is a one sided relationship you do nothing to help the merchants you only collect Reddit doesnt deserve those commissions in my opinion Make it optin and be fair to the users This feels like something I dont need or want This feels like an instance of the admins putting Reddits needs before the reddit communitys needs Which I should note is their perrogative but still leaves a nasty taste in my mouth I hear Digg is palatable again though so do whatever you want I have alternatives How can I make my adblocker kill the affiliate links client side scripting  rewrite links And youve just gone full Digg with the arbitrary monetization nonsense Its like every year you guys do some new crazy shit around the same time Is this the time of year where all the CEO plans have to start coming to fruition or the investors get finicky Good luck im pretty sure this qualifies as a man in the middle attack Most advertisers terms of service prohibit such acts Stop buying gold Stop giving Reddit admins a reason to continue to show how they dont care about the user base Another overreach and a far cry from reddits original intent  message Ill be waiting patiently for an alternative I dont like this I dont want this Hmmmm bold strategy cotton Boo Will this strip out or replace other cookies that we as consumers use for our own cashback incentives As I feel if I go to a site after yours but I get cashback for it I want that one and not you im afraid You dont explicitly mention anything regarding this and I would be keen to hear a response thanks viglink sucks If I were eBay or some other big vendor i would reject this deal with reddit and not pay commission They dont win anything Reddit then has the option to blacklist merchants not paying commission but that seems like a risky way to go If this works its great but there is no such thing as free money In this case the merchants are paying and if this becomes an overwhelming expense I bet theyll counter schemes like this How will revenue generated through this user created content be shared with the very users creating this content How does this not set up an exploitative form of immaterial digital labor as a revenue model for Reddit  Will users who are not signed in be affected  What about Android and iOS app users So we need to copy the link and paste it into our browser ourselves If we want to maintain our privacy Okay thats easy But a link to a merchant isnt that spam by definition What will this look like in practice If I post a link to a storm trooper necklace and dont opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link it will be rewritten so that youre redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made Am I to understand from this that from a users perspective were still ending up looking at whatever was actually originally linked at The affiliate link doesnt lead us somewhere different it just ensures that Reddit gets credit hey that rhymes for new userscustomers referred from here Sorry Im just kinda confused about what this whole thing means Is reddit gold not enough to fill your white male tears mugs any more admins When you say the links are added via JS does that mean that Reddit is sourcing JS files from an external domain You can opt out Thank you I thought this site was totally ruined for a split second The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link You know Ive known for years that I ought to disable javascript to prevent exactly this type of fuckery I guess its finally time Seems really shitty and shady to do this while displaying a deliberately misleading hover text for the link Thanks for the notice disabled deleted   This comment has been overwritten by this open source

NoScript shield me from all of this Viglink nonsense if not is there an extension that will Any advice or recommendations for something that can keep me from manually doing things to prevent clickjacking are welcome I am not ok with this reddit I dont think many people are Weve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they wont store user data or cookies during this process And you believe that Unless theres a clause in the contract that says the CEO of the company will be personally liable forever and be punished by one whiplash per redditor if this clause is broken I wont allow this So please tell me how can I block this on my side proceeds to head into my preferences and turns off affiliate links Ok Ill have to admit that despite having some trust in Reddit I dont trust this third party I have some questions Will the links be rewritten on the server and not injected via third party scripts Please say the former because I frankly dont trust this company despite what you say In two subreddits I moderate  raudiophile and rheadphones  we have kept affiliate links banned for three years outright for very good reasons While we dont actually allow purchase help type posts we do have stickies where it is allowed to appease the people who ask for such help anyway We enforce this rule through Automoderator through banning both anything that blinds the end destination of a link read link shorteners and we ban any known affiliate codes While I sort of expect AutoModerator not to ever trigger on links rewritten by Reddit I have a fear that this will make it more difficult to justify to our users why we ban these links People have a clear expectation with regard to the semantics of clicking a link Redirecting them to a different link is sleezy I will do everything in my power to thwart this campaign including publishing browser extensions and adblock filters as well as verbally trashing Reddit for sneaky practices to anyone that will listen Viglink domain is blacklisted by our company DNS Soon everyone will be rightclicking in my office and thats when Ill know theyre on Reddit Let me guess this company is based in the USA not EU and hence isnt bound by europeanstyle data protectionprivacy laws instead based on US law Please dont break middle click All to often these javascript solutions break the ability to middle click and open in a new tab Why use JavaScript to modify the link That feels really sketchy Why redirect through a third party service thus sending them all sorts of trackable info such as my IP browser fingerprint referer etc instead of just rewriting the link yourself eg why change examplecom to blahnetskdifdjvdndh which eventually leads to examplecomreddit instead of just changing the link to examplecomreddit  It all feels pretty sketchy Why are the users in this thread so much more willing to slide the privacy concerns this brings under the rug than in the older rchangelog thread httpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsldkrredditchangeaffiliatelinksonreddit Why not Amazon just curious May I ask why Amazon isnt on the list Didnt they agree or arent they part of the viglink thing or didnt you approach them If the last one is true why deleted I work in the office of a congressman There are two ways to get our attention  mass phone calls and  form issue mailings  Phone Calls Your best bet is to call the DC office as they handle more of the policy related matters When I worked phones I kept a legal pad in front of me and kept track of the issues that we got a lot of calls on If an issue got hot over  or so calls I would let a policy adviser know I dont know how other offices worked but my Congressman kept tract of the issues that got hot Heres a little tip for the phone calls though the person on the other line isnt a miracle worker No they cant tell you why the Congressman supports or doesnt support that bill unless the policy advisers have told them to do so No they dont care why you think the Congressman is a dumbass for doing this or that And no you cannot talk to the Congressman Keep the call short tell me which bill you support or dont support and be polite If I get three callers yelling and cursing at me and the fourth is polite and thanks me for my time you can guess which caller Im going to go the extra mile for Also they will usually ask for your name number and address before you get off the call This isnt part of some grand government conspiracy to steal your lunch money Its so we can keep up to date on the issue Your info goes into a program which lets us keep tract of constituents by issue so we dont waste our time going through legal pads of caller info when we send out a letter about how the issue got resolved This program is NOT accessible to the campaign and it would be a violation of federal election law to do so Protip This may get you on a fundraising listserv but calling the campaign office with your policy concerns will ensure the topic is addressed  Mass mailings Theres a commonly held belief that elected officials give letters more weight than other communication This is only partially true Some people send us a letter about every topic that ever crosses their mind And I mean EVERY topic If you always write us we barely pay attention to you after a while I would say that  of the letters we receive come from  of the people who ever send a letter to our office If its the first time youve contacted the office youll get more attention That being said when I handled mail what really got my attention was receiving several form issue letters everyday over a sustained period of time When I say form issue letters I mean the things that say DEAR CONGRESSPERSON I INSERT YOUR NAME SUPPORT HR OVER  AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TOO For example I remember receiving a couple of these form letters concerning the funding of a local military base on a Monday or a Tuesday and basically ignoring it However as the week progressed the number we received went from a couple to several dozen per day You bet your sweet ass we addressed that issue as soon as we could find a camera  Republicans to  Democrats shows that they CAN be bipartisan Bipartisan about being fucking retarded Here is the letter I just sent to my congressman Dear Congressman  I am writing you today about a provision in the Stop Online Piracy Act SOPA introduced on Oct   It seems to me that this legislation had the effect of creating an American internet firewall one that could severely restrict the ability of Americans Citizens to access the internet similar to the regressive policies of countries like China In June of this year the United Nations declared that access to the internet is a basic human right and unfettered access to information was crucial in the recent Democratic uprisings in the Middle East It is very disheartening to learn that the US Congress is considering the restriction of a resource so vast and important that it has completely changed communications access to informational resources and the expression of all of our freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution Specifically the SOPA does two things that promote the censorship of the internet in the USA First it would allow for suspension of service prior to being found guilty by holding any site with user generated content Currently websites such as Google Twitter and YouTube operate under a safeharbor provision in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act that if invalidated would force these sites to suspend user access before determining whether the users were actually guilty of copyright infringement This is frankly a usurpation of due process established by the th  th Amendments to the US Constitution Second Section  of the SOPA allows for the Blacklisting by the Attorney Generals Office of any website accused of harboring a copyright infringement again without the prior establishment of guilt under due process The ability of a government agency to ban user access to an online site or service without due process is simply a reprehensible act of censorship and nothing less Online piracy can indeed be a problem although in some cases piracy can lead to an increase in visibility for software or an online service that ends up creating more revenue for the developer artist or creator of the product The issue of copyright infringement pales in comparison however to the idea that American access to the internet could be disrupted censored or denied without first establishing guilt Free and unrestricted access to information is the arbiter of a Democracy restricting the access of American Citizens to the vast resources of the internet in any form goes against the very values enshrined in the Democratic spirit of our Country Thank you for your time and service misterthirsty Isnt the porn industry the most heavily affected by online copyright infringement If this thing passes will a big chunk of copyright attorneys be spending the next few years trying to figure out just whose porn belongs to who and sue accordingly Reminder hand written letters are much more likely to be taken seriously than emails Also heres a commenthttpwwwredditcomrtechnologycommentslxrpksoiemailedmyhouserepresentativeaboutthecwian on how best to reach your House rep written by a former staffer and featured on both rbestof and rdepthhub deleted Posting from Japan after a lengthy discussion with the missus If this bill passes it is going to affect everyone here geek or regular office worker big time Many big conventions such as Comiket will cease and giant sites such as NicoNicoDouga and Pixiv will close entirely Weve helped by signing petitions for this weeks in advance I just hope people come to their senses and notice how much this will cripple the world not only America Fun Fact Sopa actually means piece of garbage in sweden Ill probably get lost in the deluge but Id like to share my email to both reperesentives from Florida who sponsored this bill Dear CongressmanCongresswoman   I understand you have significant experience in law As such you probably thought that the Stop Online Piracy Act you sponsored in Congress was a good idea Its intended to finally crack down on intellectual property theft and help to encourage intellectual property holders to continue to create However as someone who is more than proficient in Internet technologies culture law and practices I fear the bill youre supporting would be a significant threat to everyones freedoms After reading the text of the bill my understanding of it is that it would not only hold site owners responsible for the content users post it would also require various internet services DNS advertisement companies and ISPs to cease all business with and revoke access to sites that are only accused of hosting infringing material This I feel would violate due process restrict free speech and cause a significant chilling effect in new ideasdesigns Please consider the following suppose that you and I both own web services If we are in competition anything that I can do to get more traffic than you would be a bonus to my profits Under this bill the easiest way for me to get an advantage would be to upload my intellectual property to your site using proper obfuscation technologies like a VPN or TOR and then accuse you of hosting illegally obtained material You without the benefit of a court to defend yourself would find your sites name removed from American DNS servers would lose significant ad revenue and would be locked out of your site until you could find and delete my material It would be so easy to repeat that once you were operating again I could use the same trick There would be no defense against this attack and it would be completely legal In fact the terms of this bill are so broad that I wouldnt even need to actually upload my material to your site I could just accuse you of hosting my material You would have no opportunity to dispute my claim and you would have the onus of proof of your own innocence instead of me having the onus to prove your guilt If these two scenarios seem farfetched I ask you to refer to the recent actions of Warner Bros They sent false takedown requests to Hotfile and even used Hotfiles antipiracy programs to remove protected materials they didnt own I assure you this is common practice on the internet If all I need to do is accuse you of doing something and you are assumed guilty until you can prove your innocence our entire system of justice and due process is undermined This bill would also causes a chilling effect on the production of new ideas If all it takes is one jealous competitor or one sloppy rightsholder to permanently remove my ability to produce I would refrain from doing so If you now consider the current system youll see that the DMCA has sufficient power to protect ideas It may have flaws and its jurisdiction may not apply to foreign sites but that is the nature of international law America though we are a great nation can neither enforce our standards upon other countries nor can it undermine its citizens ability to freely access all material online However the DMCA is sufficient to discourage piracy as well as compassionate enough to allow new ideas to come to light In conclusion this bill you have sponsored would not solve any problems and would only further tarnish Americas reputation abroad We would engage in the same louche practices we condemn China for practicing For this reason I do not support your decision to sponsor this bill Further I think that your sponsorship of this bill shames the Democratic party as well as the great state of Florida You should be ashamed Sincerely LightofAiur I doubt itll ever be seen by my representatives but I think I did alright Its funny how they explicitly name it Stop Piracy Online As a Californian Id like to apologize for the fact that we have  of the sponsors from here Reddit should turn its background black rather more sites should on the special day Back in the s there was similar retarded legislation and a whole bunch of websites all went black for a while It got them on the news when the consumer Internet was still in its fledgling infancy and the legislation was defeated Cant remember what the bill was but it was certainly bizarre seeing Webcrawler et al all black Edit My googlefu turned this up httpenwikipediaorgwikiBlackWorldWideWebprotest The CDA was in fact ruled unconstitutional and the bill wasnt defeated an injunction was filed before it could take effect What can us nonUS Redditors do Cmon American Redditors Were rooting for you Save the whales internet Dear Mr Congressman It has come to my attention that you will soon be voting on the SOPA I must tell you that Im hard pressed to find a reason why such a bill should be passed I would really appreciate you beating off the pressures from media giants to pass this bill because of its consequences If you could all come up with a solution that would stem piracy without restricting freedoms then Im all ears Id swallow my pride and go against my lobbyist friends if I were you because its the right thing to do Best Regards MediumPace If you are a member of a major union please write your union and ask them to end their support of this bill This bill has the support of nearly every major union and thats a HUGE advantage of supporters of the bill because it gives the appearance of this bill being to the benefit of the people when really its just unions looking out for the employment interests of their members and not the civil liberties interest of their members  This comment has been removed due to a Copyright claim by Sony Music Entertainment Hey MPAA  RIAA I

things that willmight be gone forever if this this happens At least affected There is obviously more but here goes  Failblog Winblog chan etc  Reddit   Imgur Tinypic etc  YouTube Facebook Twitter etc  Google Bing Yahoo etc  Several news websites  Everything concerning pornographic content   Half of the blogs that exists or more  A LOT OF GAMING WEBSITES Basically all unofficial websites Thats the first things I can think about please put me right if Ive gone too far Ive also though about emails Will all unapproved content sent in an email be illegal Texas Why am I not fucking surprised my state would do this I dont understand whats going on here Why did only  of people upvote this Do we have a bunch of astroturfers here Seriously I guess  of people want reddit to possibly be shut down Do yall work for a record label and mooch offshake down artists Seriously if you downvoted this I want to know why You americans are in a big responsability because even though your government is completely incompetent the world and especially europe listens to you We may laugh about you actions but in the end if that gets passed in your country its just a matter of time until that happens in the rest of the world So dont just sstand up for you stand up for all of the world here is some text you can use It has come to my attention that you will soon be voting on the Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA act I am writing to urge you not to vote for the SOPA There are plenty of laws already in place that govern the dissemination of copy written material and we dont need any more Forcing site owners to police the content of their communities at the behest of copyright holder will only stem creativity and restrict freedom of expression Big copyright holders have pockets deep enough to police the use of their own content They should adjust their business practices to encourage purchase and not work to further punish their customers Instead SOPA will allow the government to become the copyright enforcement arm of big corporations Furthermore creation of additional governmental entities to support SOPA should it be voted into law will only increase the already large burden on the taxpayer As I mentioned above existing laws provide plenty of ability for copyright holders to enforce their rights SOPA would be an expensive redundant law endangering freedom of expression hindering creativity and putting a nontrivial amount of power over the openness and freedom of the internet in the hands of corporations that do not always have the best interest of the American people as a top priority I encourage you to vote NO to the SOPA Sincerly comment redacted ITS THE CYBER POLICE OH SHI Thank goodness no one from my state is up there Now I dont have to do anything California whats wrong with you If SOPA becomes law just disobey it Id actually love to watch what would happen when they  Are so overrun with copyright infringement cases that actual criminals are largely ignored  Watch them try to arrest millions of people that range in age from  years old because they had copyrighted music or movies playing Need to organize a internet general strike Once you take away the ability to see if the snowman from Elf is the same guy who sung the Mr Belvedere theme theyll cave I will upvote this to high hell Okay maybe only one upvote But hopefully others will upvote too Is there anything that people who arent from US can do to help Sorry Reddit were too busy with puns to fight the machine Sad but true Come on guys do it for the porn sites first they came for my music and movies next theyll come for my porn Send your representative a physical letter in just a few clicks httpssendwritecomsopa deleted Yeah stop censorship reddit Wow this bill seems like a classic excuse to ban everything they want from the internet Im glad i dont live in America SOPA means piece of trash in Swedish Pretty accurate For anyone living in Utah please call your representative I just called and they dont seem to be inundated with calls Phones should be off the hook Residents of Utah are represented in Congress by  Senators and  Representatives Member Name DC Phone DC FAX Contact Form Senator Orrin G Hatch R UT   httphatchsenategovpublicindexcfmemailorrin Senator Mike Lee R UT   httpleesenategovpublicindexcfmcontactsenato  Representative Rob Bishop R

the host file I wonder what Anonymous thinks about all this Its kind of ironic that the the first sentence of the bill says to promote creativity and innovation One day closer to Year Zerohttpwwwartisresistancecom Its so funny that Lee Terry RNE has himself already breached SOPA if he passes it He has uploaded Fox News clips like thishttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvJvDXGKqMfeaturechannelvideotitle one on his Youtube channelhttpwwwyoutubecomuserNebraskaTerry Please do this for all us Canadians who will be directly affected by this I like it that they call it the Piracy Act just so if you disagree with it they can say Oh you agree with piracy Youre evil you disagree with America Go back to Somalia Blah blah blah Sent my letter  EFF has a nicely written letter all you have to do is put your name in  Why dont they regulate the banks instead of the internet This is a distraction from what is important quickly back up the entire internet to your C drives Stop Censorship Downvoting is our job ALABAMA IS NOT SPONSORING THIS WOO Im actually somewhat proud of my conservative republicans Hey Reddit and fellow Redditors If this bill passes you have one piece of power left Tell these people to go fuck themselves Start a national boycott of the movie theaters cable television and so on Push them completely out of business Such a great cause reddit is sticking by the best part is how they REDDIT GOLD ONLY If this passes the rest of the world is going to have no choice but to unite and invade the US to save it from itself Seriously its time to set fire to Washington  you are being screwed  we have more accountability in South Africa for FFS  and our corruption ratings arent so flash Dont think that the provisions of this havent been tested already with a more secretive relatively response to Wikileaks Now they are doing this for real see retroimmunity for telecoms under the Patriot Act at a time when they are limiting press access to the forcible removal of mostly legal save camping and curfew laws citizens exercising their First Amendment rights They are taking steps to legalize and routinely use the ability to cut off Internet access for anyone or any entity deemed something with little oversite as to what that something is or how it is defined or implemented We already lost chunks of our Fourth Amendment rights and others to the more physical Patriot Act this one is the digital version and its part of a coordinated attack on our First Amendment rights Thats Speech Assembly Press Redress of Grievances All thats left then is Religion but were completely OK on that one Why is writing a letter deemed the most prudent method for contacting these representatives when time is of the essence Also it seems that letters are encouraged since it somehow indicates an air of being polite or cordial Bullshit Right now the best thing to do is flood their offices with phone calls These people answer to you and are supposed to represent our interests Call them incessantly and demand that they do not pass this bill Hold them accountable to the true letter of being a representative The time for any conceived notion of being polite is over These people abandoned that concept long ago when they allowed greed to rule their conscience rather than the spirit of democracy I wrote a letter to  NY representatives But they each have provisions on their form that checks if you are even FROM their particular district If you are not from their district they ignore the letter and it is instantly deleted I am from New York but their web forms are coded to delete my letters because Im not technically a constituent In effect those who are trying to pass a bill that effects ALL OF US are IGNORING THE OPINION OF ALL OF US Therefor I post my entire letter here for anyone else to use If you dont know what to write and yet you ARE from their districts you can use mine Hi my name is REPLACE YOUR NAME HERE Im from WHERE YOU ARE FROM I dont normally write to my congressman but this is vitally important to the integrity of all that America stands for The Stop Online Piracy Act goes way too far giving too much censorship power to those who would abuse it without any regard to the consequences such as collateral damage that will effect hundreds of thousands of websites Not just the very few websites that host illegal content but every single website even the WhiteHouseorg Any user could post in a forum message board or comment field a link to a questionable website If SOPA passes by law WhiteHouseorg would have to be blocked after an infringement claim The very foundation of America is based on free information exchange and freedom of speech This bill goes against everything that defines America and it serves nothing but to perpetuate and assist old broken business models that refuse to embrace the internet and adapt The RIAA and MPAA keep influencing Congress to adapt these draconian measures to help them survive with zero regard for how it effects all Americans The Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act has enabled many vital and internet defining websites to function such as YouTube Without the Safe Harbor provisions a single bad upload by any user to YouTube could shut down the entire site based off an infringement claim The DMCA already provides adequate legal means to take down infringing works from a website This system has worked for over  years but SOPA has measures that will effectively kill the Safe Harbor provisions of the DMCA which would stifle innovation meaning no more sites being created such as YouTube and Wikipedia and leading to less job creation in the IT and Web Development fields This is the absolute worst bill Ive ever seen and I am appalled that it would even be considered I am not alone in my sentiment hundreds of thousands are appalled and millions of Americans will be stunned if such an act should pass If you truly care about America and the freedoms we share and proudly show to the rest of the world as an example youd know what you must do First thought Phew glad this isnt happening in the UK Second thought Oh shit  of the content I enjoy on the internet comes from the US Third thought Oh fucking shit well be next Best of luck fighting this crap guys were all behind you Seeeaarch SEEAAAARRRCCCHHH Why do things feel so static recently As an addict waking up in the morning to check Reddit I feel like youre holding back the drug here Whats up with the abnormal increase in Reddit downtime lately Or patches of unavailability might be a more apt description Did I read that right Youre looking for android developers Does that mean a native android app is in the works Also if youre looking for more folks I would love to help  I have about  hours Im sorry but to keep with the agile development philosophy can you please express that in story points Asked this last time Ive heard admins talk a lot about the infrastructure of reddits code and how awful it is  built in an omg we need to get the site back up sort of way or just hacking existing code to make new features Are there any plans to completely overhaul any of the infrastructure something like modmail for example which is just a hack of inbox messages which is just a hack of comments which makes it very hard to improve a really really shitty system   Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster better and more enjoyably Awesome Is there a time estimate for this Curious to know how much of an overhaul exactly  just certain features like modmail everything from the bottom up deleted How is the search function going What tools and technologies are you researching for enhancing your data pipeline and data science platform Obviously theres a lot of great emerging and established technologies in the space Hadoop  Spark Elasticsearch  Kibana Kafka  Storm etc etc so Im really curious which approach your engineering team chooseswill choose and why Whatre the plans with the iOS interface Are we going to see a major revamp or are you sticking with the diagonal theme Hiring strong engineers like mad Im pretty good at poly bridgehttpstoresteampoweredcomapp and bench  That work for you Uhh so this may be minor or may have been mentioned before Hell I dont even know if this is something you can fix but here goes  On the mobile site whenever I click a link or post itll take me to its page normal However when I want to go back itll send me right up to the top of Reddit and kills the progress Ive made scrolling down far  Sometimes when I want to open up the comments section I will hold down the comments icon in the attempt to open it in a new page since I dont want to deal with the thing happening where Ill have to go back and be shot up to the top again Many times that function of holding the comment button and trying to open a new page will not work If you could fix this or offer an explanation thatd be great Thanks for doing this What the fucks your problem with cilantro Hey I have an idea for monetizing reddithear me out You know how other sites steal from reddits front page and just spread it through the internet Why dont you guys hire a few editors and basically create your own buzzfeed but basically link back to the OG reddit links and what not I mean its perfectly legit Also Reddit gold is useless Why should I have it It feels uselessif you can make it worth something Edit Ohum thanksfor reddit gold I think Edit  Okay haha I got gilded because I said reddit gold is useless I would respectfully ask you guys to stop gilding me but knowing Reddit I would be gilded even more or something But seriously guys there are so many other comments that more clever funnier than mine that deserved to be gilded So likechill lol Edit  The fuck am I supposed to do with  gold Last Edit Alright I dont wanna come off as complaining for being gilded but Ive been gilded prior to today And every time prior I would usually know who gilded me which is awesome because I would thank them personally But its sorta weird but all of the  gilds were by anonymous peoplenot even one of them showing their name Thought Id share Lastest Edit Wise Sage status Lets get it I know someone else said SEAAAAAARCCH but what about searching comments Ive been around longer than rannouncements and with the cyclical nature of Reddit were capitalising now right I find myself searching for answers I gave years ago Any hope for this When Reddit says its servers are busy does that mean youre seeing a spike in traffic in which case you should be spinning up new instances but dont  or did you have servers fall over and get removed from the LB or is it a code error somewhere It just strikes me as weird that reddit constantly throws s for no discernible reason First Edit Let this be a lesson kids If you work hard you can be an Flist celebrity and get upvotes for saying first So the mods had their tantrum for their tools and support my tantrum is about getting Servers too busy try again later pages multiple times a day I assume you are working on it but in the spirit of openness would you please create a page with a graph that tells us how many times a day the overlimit page is served That way we can see your progress in gradually bringing it to zero The modss problems affect them and I hope theyre getting satisfaction but this is the primary issue affecting me as a user and just because I cant threaten to take the site dark Id like to know its being addressed Thanks If you dont mind my asking exactly which mod tools are you thinking of making your highest priority at the moment Ive seen many people complain about the new algorithm saying that popular posts are staying on the front page for too long Are there plans to revert back to the old one or to modify the new one to change this Hello I just had a couple questions How is being a CTO and were you at one point a CIO What degrees did you get when attending collegeuniversity CSBusiness Administration Thanks in advance MartyWeiner     EDIT I was interested in pursuing a similar career that is why the questions are geared towards that Im just realizing Ive got a surprisingly large amount of forehead in the incredibly photogenic photo Can somebody please fix that Whats to be done about the site regularly going down due to high traffic The frontpage is always stale When I wake up in the morning I find the same content from when I went to sleep It never used to be this way and I heard that the ranking algorithms had changed Why did they change Will they be reverted Is there more information on this Are the mod tools fixed yet httpswwwredditcomrAskRedditwikitimer deleted deleted Why is the site seaming stale lately Are there plans to revise the rating system Cool Hows it going What advice would you give to a freshman in HS as to how to get into this industry in a few years Since the change to reddits capping system and subsequent reversion there have been many people talking about stale content Is there anything in the works to tinker with the algorithm that decides how long content stays up before new content is promoted Next Ive been noticing a number of outages recently I heard a number are related to problems with Amazons cloud services Are there any plans to bring more of your services in house or to find additional cloud providers so that a single providers outages dont bring your whole service down Is Reddit reworking the voting algorithm so that the vote cap can be raised without negative ie static front page consequences Also what are your thoughts on Alien Blue getting a feature to be able to view gilded postscomments How far along with an android app are you And what will make it different than reddit is fun you definitely have the most unfortunate name for running this website though Be honest how many times a day do people make dick jokes hey uryanmerket Reddit Ads Product Manager since you deleted your keyword comment but now I know who I can ask Can we still comment on how shit an ad isif said ad is subjectively shit to us ad discussions disappear or the ad itself gets deleted which is kinda a bummer when I wanna show someone how cool or lame the product placement on Reddit was Wish this wasnt so any keyword infested answer to this would be appreciated  If you prefer to stick with wwwredditcom there is a very easy way to opt out All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select Desktop Site The next time you come back you will be served the desktop site by default Thanks for this I panicked when it kept switching to mobile view One of the things that I hate more than anything else is clicking on a httpm link on desktop and not being redirected to the desktop version Any chance that could happen ie desktop user inadvertently ends up going to mredditcomsomelink but should be redirected to redditcomsomelink What if you use redditcomcompact Thats what I use and I prefer it What was wrong with the old compact view httpiredditcom or httpwwwredditcomcompact What is the plan for the compact version of Reddit I really prefer that UI If feels a lot less cluttered Things I like  Night View   Compact List Handy to have the option  Decent UI Pretty good layout of most things Things I dont like  No Multireddits I LOVE my Multis I need them  Cant sort my subscribed subs alphabetically Since there are no multis I need this  Often takes a long time to load content Probably will be be fixed soon yes Overall kudos on a pretty good roll out of the mobile site I hope you can add multis soon and then Id switch over from the desktop site with no reservations Hmm compact view had me excited but its the same mredditcom and I dont find much compact about it I would love it to be more like exactly like for all I care iredditcom just with actions like permalink and collapse not hidden behind additional clicks Can we get a compactcompact or compact mode for mredditcom Edit Apparently you have to go into the settings dropdown and toggle from Card to Compact Thats better but how come it doesnt respect my user preference to not show thumbnail previews Edit  Also doesnt respect my user preference to not media at the top of the comments page deleted Ive been using the other compact view the one where you put compact at the end of a regular Reddit URL Im actually quite happy with that obe for the most part I dont like mreddit  from what i remember it doesnt seem as responsive and its always trying to load things in an ajaxy manner with varying results redditcomcompact remains superior for density and clarity even if it looks a decade old I dont think this is a great change but I think its going to be hard to beat the utility of the desktop site To be honest it seems like its missed the mark Great if you were starting a new site from scratch but not because weve all been using desktop Reddit too long Specifics  drastically reduced number of links viewable without scroll On my screen its  vs  iPhone s plus  no links in the top bar to my subreddits  no link to Rall  I dont want to type to find subreddits Im on mobile why am I typing  no link color change for visited links  different positioning of upvotes comments etc from desktop site Why are you moving things around Now I have to remember where things are on mobile and desktop separately Bad UX  no link directly to my profile without using the mobile menu  relying too much on the mobile menu generally To be honest I would go back to the drawing board and condense the desktop site to play nicely on mobile slightly larger text use swipe functionality to showhide sidebar on mobile and ditch the hamburger menu completely This may be a bit harsh  and Im a web dev too so dont take this too personally but you could probably inspect element  increase some font sizes and streamline text on the desktop site change some CSS and have something Id be more likely to use than mredditcom Far too much white space httpswwwredditcomcompact is almost perfect Im near sighted I love having a large amount of detailed information in the usable screen space Id like to think alot of people are like me Why is the trend in developing to market to blind users with huge tiles of the least amount of information possible Can you guys make an announcement on what went down in Orlando and with one of your biggest subs and censorship I am sorry for using a harsh language but who in their right mind things that this fucking static nav bar is a good idea This shit pisses me off to no end on a lot of mobile sites Screen estate on mobile is very precious and I hate when  of my screen height is wasted by this unnecessary shit I browse in landscape mode a lot I like the compact compact view while words cant describe how much I hate the mobile m view I dont know what view this post is taking about but it looks like the mobile view Basically there appear to be three views including the desktop for mobile at least on Android Thank you so much for the option to opt out I hate the mobile site and when it came up on my phone with my regular Reddit bookmark I died a little inside I am glad you presented the oppurtunity to opt out I was incredibly disheartened when I saw a sponsored post slipped into the middle of my browsing It is pretty clear that improving the ad exposure was a big factor in this change As always you keep us involved with threads like these but I really do not like seeing a sponsored Ad slipped into the middle of a bunch of normal links Its sneaky and you know it I would say you made things worse I just spent a good while getting pissed to a whole new level just trying to figure out why my usual reddit page turned practically to shit and why I cant just change the url to get back to the normal full site So then eventually i bring myself to google my problem since someone else must be dealing with this same thing and then i find this Stop fixing whats not broke if anything make it by defgault the full site and then add a very obvious and fully visible button to switch to mobile if that should be something they desire Point is that button was like hidden and out of sigh and should ideally be more like  desktop site Mobile site rather than just desktop site Yeah i got forced onto this thing legit tried to use it for  minutes then spent another  trying to get off it I think the desktop version  mobile by miles Long way to go Desktop is superior on smartphones too TBH literally all I want from a mobile site is a slightly different shaped desktop site with a bigger show comments button Used it for  minutes and switched to the desktop site So thanks for making that an option Likes the look of it its clean and not full of clutter Dislikes why does no Reddit app or mobile site never have any moderator tools Whats with that I use my phone  of the time since I dont have a laptop or desktop computer Sometimes I use my kindle Moderators need moderator tools Why is this on a separate subdomain Now mobile users which appear to be a majority these days are going to post mredditcom links everywhere and us desktop users are going to be stuck looking at a shitty mobile site on our huge screens Its mwikipediaorg all over again The think youre looking for to fix this is responsive design What happens to those of us that prefer iredditcom over the other mobile views The newer mredditcom feels cluttered but at the same time too compressed for me Iredditcom strikes a nice balance for how its laid out and the blue and grey is also very nice In all honesty i cannot stand the mobile version Id rather use alien blue and i do use alien blue it blows the reddit app out of the water Personally I do not like the mobile version of Reddit Not only that but the fact that it automatically took you there when you went to the Redditcom page I thought was very intrusive of Redditcom to do that Its one thing for us to choose it Its another to be forced over and over to have it show up on my cell phone Please do not do this to us I have switched it back to desk top after reading all the posts But please dont do this to us Why the hell are you forcing the mobile site on us iPhone users I seriously hate hate hate hate hate the mobile version of the site Please do not make it default Take a lesson from Apple Work your product until its perfect Dont release it prematurely We now have a mobile app and a mobile interface that both are disappointing to users Features are missing Theyre harder to read What was the rush Now youve damaged the reputation of these products Worse as a company you at best seem like incompetent developers and at worst like youre out of touch with users needs This is a leadership issue Rethink who is leading these efforts Can you remove the next page button and load the next page automatically when a user scrolls all the way to the end of the current page Why do sites like this try to keep pushing us to a mobile version I understand that not everyone is using a AppleSamsung smart phone but why not let us CHOOSE to go to the mobile version rather than make us you need to get the fuck off and leave the user alone I fucking hate mobile site and do not force me to browse that piece of shit UI Opting out seems to be broken and it is incredibly frustrating to have to click to view the desktop version To clarify the desktop view sticks when i open redditcom but if I follow a google link it still defaults to mobile Why wont it just remember that I prefer the desktop view Will I still be able to access the classic iredditcomcompact that Im used to TLDR Fewer buttons LOTS more scrolling At least you can optout and the try reddit mobile banner is gone Why do sites even make mobile versions anyway Theyre ALWAYS shitty We almost all have powerful enough phones now to handle the desktop site you can stop now I absolutely hate the mobile site please stop forcing me to use it I find it completely useless and confusing I hate mobile Reddit I hate the new mobile app Just let me use Alien Blue Any plans to get rid of the infuriating smug alien that pops up for several seconds on any sort of navigation even when the page is already cached Not to rain on the parade but the new update makes reddit completely unusable from my phone I had to log in at a laptop to type this because none of the buttons load properly orange or grey rectangles only or respond to touch updownvoting reply button even the options menu from which I could disable the mobile layout all unusable Please consider adding an accountwide way to disable the mobile view so that I can reddit from my phone again i prefer the iredditcom site I hope thats not going away I was incredibly pissed at you guys till I figured the Desktop option out for myself Then I found this post Can the timestamps on the mobile site be fixed Im looking at a top alltime post in a default sub and it tells me that its d h old That thats about a month shy of seven years ago but I for one wouldnt know that off the top of my head Two units is good on the desktop version that same post is shown as  years ago but they should not require conversions If I were designing it here are some sample timestamps Id use in order  just now  m  h m  d h  mo d  y mo Hated it Stop forcing me to use the mobile site My phone is far more powerful than my junky laptop and if I wanted a mobile experience I would god damned opt in compact view is in fact less compact than the desktop site wtf desktop site much better When I went to Reddit on my phone today I felt like I was hijacked We should have to opt in not out Youre joking Right The new version puts about two or three comments on my screen not a small phone with no way to tell by looking which is the parent Please please please dont make it harder to read on a small screen Can you turn off the you have been disconnected from the internet you have been reconnected to the internet popups As someone with a long commute through patchy service areas I often load  tabs and browse at leisure Getting these popups is very annoying At least have it auto close or make it less obtrusive I dont want Reddit mobile I dont want the blue bar telling me to switch I dont want some asshole website that Ive used for over  years to switch me over to mobile automatically Make it an option that can be denied or accepted by the user with a onetime confirmation Edit I know you can press menuDesktop site but that was hidden and you had to hijack my browser in the first place Make it an optin experience for now until a period of time where experienced users can decline the new experience but new users will eventually get the experience by default I like desktop on mobile I almost flipped out before finding the desktop option Phew I dont use the mobile version simply because I dont like the layout feels clunky somehow and its less functional The desktop version looks better I prefer seeing more links at once and I dont like that you cant click on a commenters name to go to their profile on mobile Thank you for making it so easy to opt out of it Without having access to mod actions like remove Im sticking with regular desktop browser it also hung when i tried to check my new messages Its nowhere near compact enough Not even close tbh Maybe four times the information density It annoys the shit out of me I keep selecting desktop site and it still keeps coming up as mredditcom instead of redditcom I prefer the nonmobile site because it lets me see an overview instead of just three subjects at a times Every time I exit Chrome and start it again it defaults back to the mreddit I am vision impaired and need to zoom in to read posts on my mobile the new site did not allow zooming so went back to the desktop site Its weird that the mobile compact view is so much less compact than just using the desktop site I dont like the mobile site I dont mind having to pinch to click on that microscopic message button The mobile layout is justmeh In my oppinion it looks horrible Im sticking with the desktop version When I select desktop site Im often denied Then I rage a little If I want the desktop site just give me the freaking desktop site I like the new layout but if I click a link while browsing the comments then go back to the comments the page reloads the comments via AJAX When this happens I lose my location along with having all comments that had been collapse become reexpanded I hate it I never know whats going on unless I see Reddit the way I learned Reddit and thats the desktop version This is broken with ad blockers The top toolbar doesnt appear at all I use blocker Please stop telling me to get the app I dont want the fucking app of every damn website I visit yet they all keep telling me too imgur is particularly offensive in this The website works fine why would I need it I accidentally discovered the mobile site last week after getting a new phone and I liked it so much that I panicked the next day when I was redirected to the normal site The mobile site is easy to navigate and looks absolutely gorgeous I usually opt out of mobile sites and stick to the desktop versions while on my phone but this is the first time Ive actually preferred the mobile version In fact I never use phone apps for sites that work perfectly fine through a browser but I think this mobile site is nicer than most sites mobile apps Im not always up to date on the latest tech or mobile stuff but for me youve really set the bar for mobile versions of web sites With that said one thing Id like to see changed is for the list of Subscribed communities to be ordered alphabetically instead of what appears to be datejoined It can be difficult to navigate the list when its essentially arbitrarily ordered Also the Settings option under the topright menu just takes me to a login screen even if Im already logged in or after logging in again Sent from my phone edit Another nice feature would be something to make it easier to distinguish which tier a comment is in when collapsing comments A faint line running alongside the comments would probably work well Please stop forcing mobile after three pages when not logged in I click the header to say no thanks to the mobile site only to have it appear again and again before forcing me to the mobile site anyways making me backtrack a page and hit next again to return the the desktop experience It is enough to make me install a VPN so I dont get pushed to the mobile site Why I like the text based information of the desktop site with quick loading and minimal graphics If I want to see the image associate with that post I click on it Forcing me to use a page with tons of whitespace and full screen images I do not want to load see vag story in this thread reminds me of the site overhaul that killed tribenet Definitely prefer desktop view but I always support options so thanks for that Your mobile site was and is still terrible and you guys are driving me insane trying to push it on me When the modern day touchscreen phones came out it was theorized that they would be the end of mobile sites that we would get the whole internet on our phones Instead people like you go and muck it all up I have gold Let me set an option to never bug me about reddit mobile again and get rid of the god damn banner that I always accidentally click because it loads after all the other content I hate mobile sites and I hate you Out of curiosity why are you guys looking to have a mobilespecific interface I dont really have issues on the normal site and at least in my opinion the current mobile version is a long ways off of being usable As for feedback it feels very compact in the sense that it displays less information on the screen which at least wasnt an issue for me but I dont know about everybody which just slows down the whole process and made me hate it before I could reasonably try it out It just feels like Im struggling to get anywhere on the site Before I give it a shot Ill just ask how are the mod tools in compact view Will I have access to the full modmail and modtool suite Not sure if I just hate change in general I feel like it takes longer to scan through on the new one Im liking it only subscribed to a few subreddits and I can get to all of them very smoothly OK Im going to do my best to be constructive here I use Opera Mini  on a Blackberry  and your instructions for switching back to the desktop site dont work Opera Mini  only has limited Javascript support so the buttons dont have icons only boxes and when I click the top right icon all it does is reload the mobile page because the URI the link points to is just b  I presume selecting Desktop Site from the menu would take me to some page that sets an optout cookie Could you just post a URL that will set the cookie Thanks very much Please ignore the bit below if youd rather its just me blowing off steam from two hours trying to get round this myself The developers should know that not everyone has Javascript on every device This being the case why did they hide the optout link behind a link that cant be accessed without Javascript Just put a Desktop Site link at the bottom of the page  and make it text not some icon from goodnessknowswhat font And why did this not occur to anyone in the development process Edit Ive duplicated this comment minus the steamblowing on the original changelog post for this httpredditfvgs  if I get any help on either post Ill add it to the other one I get that youre excited about the new mobile version but can we PLEASE make it an optIN not an optout I use the desktop version because I want to choose what images I see not have them ALL load at once slowing my browser down to a crawl I prefer the desktop version because its easier to navigate for me and I feel that the experience is better overall I wont be getting the app because I highly doubt youve made it backwards compatible with Android  which is what I run If I wanted to browse the mobile site I would just use the app This should be an opt in not an opt out If its an opt out it should be much more obvious how to opt out It should be presented the first time you use the site I missed this announcement so I had to find it in a search If announcements are that important for people to see they should be stickied People a year from now wont know either if you leave it like this Sometimes I cant believe the stupid user interface decisions that companies think make sense So what was the point in making this mobile version of reddit when the desktop version worked great on mobile Everything is all spread out on the mobile version making it harder to read If you guys had made the mobile version have a dark bg with light font that would have been killer though Even with the worse interface Am I the only one that prefers mobile I prefer scrolling through and skimming posts quickly rather than spending too much time reading any individual thread I can do this a lot more efficiently with the mobile version Ive been using it since the beginning of beta AFAIK and it kind of surprises me that the majority appear to dislike it so much It used to annoy me to have to explicitly type mredditcom over redditcom Hell I prefer card view over compact view as well Different strokes for different folks I guess One problem I have with the mobile view is that it tries to squish everything into the width of my phone I prefer being able to have it spread out across Thanks for letting us opt out of it though When I click a link and press back it gets stuck on the same reddit page So basically I have to refresh Is there a way to disable subreddit CSS on mobile Thats the only reason I dont use it Subreddits have become like old MySpace pages One of my biggest issues with the mobile site is that sometimes things just refuse to load Sometimes comments with just refuse to load with the little loading animation playing endlessly sometimes subreddits with do the same thing etc whereas I never have the same problem with mobile apps and obviously not with the desktop site I think the best think about desktop view as counterintuitive as it may seem is how crammed everything is on the page I see a large landscape and I can quickly zoom in and out of areas of interest Mobile view feels so restrictive It also just doesnt feel like reddit There is something very effective about the bold blue title text in the way it delineates each post I would make the title text the header and make it span the width of the post The subreddit is the most prominent part of the post I think it should below the title The scrolling header should be discoverable If the heading happens to end on a space you wont know theres more Any particular reason the votes and arrows are on the lower right instead of the lower left As a righty I supposed this would make thumbing a vote much easier but you could end up with a lot more voting based on title rather than content I think lower right arrows then number of votes would look better The actual link full link should be visible or easily discoverable Clicking the post should take me to the actual link location instead of the comment page Easy way to opt out If you prefer to stick with wwwredditcom there is a very easy way to opt out All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select Desktop Site The next time you come back you will be served the desktop site by default Here is a short gif that demonstrates how to opt out It better stay on Desktop Site when I click on a reddit link from googling on mobile Ive been getting sick and tired of having mobile view forced on me when I want desktop view consistently uAmg Please redirect mobile thinks on desktops back to the desktop view though That way if mobile users link to a post it wont throw desktop users into mobile view when they view it Also the auto expanding of images at the top of the self post is super disorienting Look at your own post as an example httpsmredditcomrannouncementscommentsnclnewlookonredditmobilewebcompactview The image is out of context and WAAAAY too large The mobile version that has been forced on me looks nothing like that It has three vertical bars that are kind of fat one takes me to a submit page one goes to my messages only when I have a new one and the last seems to do nothing I hate this new mobile version that I cant get away from and I have stopped using reddit on my phone as a result I appreciate the initiative but the desktop site is the view I will be sticking with The old saying if aint broke dont fix it applies perfectly to the desktop view I still use iredditcom aka compact because its more compact than mredditcom  I would love to use the new mobile site but i just cant view enough posts on the main page for it to work I cant seem to zoom in on pictures when I open them in the mobile version Am I doing this wrong In the desktop version if I click on an imgur link the pic opens and I can squeeze or expand it but with this version it stays one size The new view seems much harder to take in for older eyes eg presbyopia That said if wwwredditcomclassictrue works then shouldnt mredditcomclassictrue as well It Fucking Sucks Eat shit Feedback gifs DONT play and now I cant even find a way to get to them this is the main reason I hate your mobile site I m on chrome droid turbo Will we ever get the option to set sort comment by lets say New to be applied to all of the threads you enter This is the single most important factor that made me not use the app as my  Reddit app When will desktop view be available for android users Currently the browser doesnt remember your viewing preference Sorry not a fan Not only is it super slow to load it managed to crash and forceclose my browser just from viewing this thread Also for some reason all the icons render as Chinese charactershttpiimgurcomGBhMNxjpg  figure that one out Granted Im using a legacy device Galaxy S on the default Internet app so the problem could be on my end Either way Im having to optout of this one Appreciate the effort but no thank you I absolutely hate this redesign I just cant contain my excitement for Reddit Announcements Thanks Reddit for being so cool D Is it possible to still stick with the original mredditcom as preferred that on my mobile over anything else If I disabled mobile view awhile ago How can I go back and give it another chance now This is a terrible change And why the hell did everything turn Japanese all of a sudden A major change like this should have been communicated better to the users and an opt out provided the first time the new skin is shown Instead Reddit chose to have a nonclosing banner ad to get the mobile app If the desktop view was not provided to opt out I would have stopped using the site I fucking hate reddit mobile and it pisses me off having to do work to not use it Edit Wow  points My highest rated comment by far RIP my inbox Agreed with all of you great Redditors Desktop is superior to mobile version Mobile just looks like a silly foreign thing compared to the desktop Yeah but  what about SRS This actually made me pretty angry at first  I use my mobile browser for the data saving features The reddit mobile website is AWFUL it constantly crashes my browser or just doesnt correctly load links and instead loads the main default page Please revert this change Hate the mobile platform definitely opted out I think it has major issues that need fixed before autoforcing it on users Yes yes theres an optout but its still autoforced This is a mobile site Then why all important controls are half the size of whats recommended for touch I mean the upvote buttons are pt wide and min recommended size is pt What is the intended purpose of this layout  design because I fail to see how people can use it with their fingers Can we switch the location of the up and downvotes It makes it easier to upvote a post if its closer to the edge and sticks to the way other apps do it That and not having mod tools are the reasons I still use AlienBlue though I try out your app every now and then just to see if its improved The biggest draw against it is the lack off fun stuff The banners the custom sub snu all the flavor that makes a sub feel unique With that stripped every sub felt really sterile and impersonal I still think a lot of improvements are needed but this is a good change Couldnt resist httpsimgurcomaqxtx  as compared to previous view When I tried clicking modmail it just gave me an error It gave me the option to switch the the desktop site which was nice but itd be cool if it worked in there Also is there a way for modmail to show was threaded in there The way it looks in ios mobile looks a little confusing imo One concern that I have and have had for a while the Reddit Mobile banner at the top doesnt always load at the same time as the rest of the page So if I queue up the website and tap to hit my username or the unread message indicator if the page is still loading occasionally the tap will register into the mobile banner instead when it snaps into view Can you either do something about that loading or change the banner behavior maybe make the tap box limited to the just the width of the text For the app is it possible to go into landscape orientation My first thoughthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvNLkzxA Ive noticed the design of the mobile site and the Reddit app are similar to one another but quite different from the desktop sitedifferent fonts different location for up and down votes etc Is an overhaul to the desktop UI coming can we get a landscape view for tablets on the app The mobile app is just inferior to the desktop app I suppose to a very basically skilled internet user the simpler design shorter less detailed menu and options are easier to use To everyone else the desktop site is easier to use The menus on the desktop app are more easily accessible easier to navigate and offer more options I can fit  to  posts depending on content on my mobile screenat one time I can only fit  to  posts on the mobile site on my screen babysteps Turn the shit off immediately I dont like looking at imgur or YouTube in desktop version on my dam phone I have to switch the show desktop or mobile button everytime i hit a link cause you want to force everyone to use this awful crap Desktop for life Please do not EVER take it way Hopefully youll see this but Ive submitted a bug under an alt account a few times and maybe under this one and havent received a response On the mobile Reddit app on iOS theres no way to clear all notifications and if you have multiple comments in a thread you need to press one go back to your inbox refresh it press the next one etc If you dont refresh every single time then only the first comment of that thread gets its notification cleared Please fix this Bring back the switch to mobile instead of offering the app that I cannot download in freaking Denmark  I have gold Im logged in and Im getting ads Fail Now it just needs a nightmode I get well over  migraines a month can only handle so much white webpages Why is a picture shown at the top of the mobile view and not the desktop view of this post There doesnt even seem to be a link or any indication there should be a picture there on desktop Can you guys keep iredditcom as it is Could you add a search within a sub option Why not make the mail status grey or orangered more prominent instead of hiding it behind the hamburger menu EDIT Looks like the orangered in mobile is a little notification above the hamburger menu I like the grey envelope though I feel like thats a staple of reddit The mobile experience looks too different  Im missing the Rising sort on both mobile and the app Please add it in Maybe my phone is shitty but pictures arent loading Does anyone else use iredditcom httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvYVktgsgih Why am I seeing a moosepopup when I try to up vote a post Its terrible Mobile websites are worthless Cant reply to messages in your inbox Uhhhh I noticed this in the desktop and mobile  but I feel like it impacts me more on mobile When Im reading through comments I usually like to minimize to scroll through faster Now lets say I click on a link in the comments visit the new page then hit back to return to reddit the comments section refreshes I know this may be more of an AJAX or localStorage issue but I feel like I have to waste time minimizing comments again to try and get back to where I was On mobile this is definitely bad UX for myself On desktop its not as bad because I usually just open a new tab redditisfun is still better sorry  All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select Desktop Site Ok So several times today I was served up the mobile site much to my dismay and aggravation I would go to the url remove the m and then try to navigate to the desktop site only to be redirected repeatedly Why not redirect to this thread or the directions to set desktop as your preference Nothing wrong with a Clippy approach It looks like you prefer the desktop experience would you like to see how to set it to do that all the time Fuck yeah I would Never force me to mobile Soo glad opt out was added as its the only feature I agree with mreddit is NOT friendly and should not be forced Stop pulling a YouTube Though really if I wanted to do a mobile version is use the appwhich I also dont use for the same reason I had a pissed off few minutes while I tried to figure out how to get it to revert back I really hate the mobile site I hate that its default and that it requires cookies to keep it as desktop rather than allowing it to be an actual setting I only ever want posts sorted by new so Im not sure why it thinks its cool to nagate the settings I intentionally choose for no good reason The comments themselves are hard to read I cant tell when people are responding to other posts without reading every one for context clues Its formatting sucks Every post is huge and it takes me forever to look at anything when I just want to read the damn post titles as I do on desktop nigger Thanks for the opt out Losing the menu bars holds no appeal I kinda like how mredditcom looks on desktop with the night theme and compact view enabled Love it Still reverts to the mobile version no matter how many times i change to desktop I hate the mobile version The automatic redirect is obnoxious and changing your settings doesnt always work Not a fan Your mobile version still sucks big time Id unsubscribe from this sub but then I wouldnt be reminded to tell you to eat shit every so often Is the AMA app abandoned I just want to ask Is there any specific direction you guys want reddit to head towards I see things like the Upvoted but Im not entirely sure how its supposed to be useful for me as a redditor I guess Im just asking what your plans are Thanks What was up with the Tom Hanks thing a couple of weeks ago where he showed up and sporadically answered a few questions karmanaut said that yall had coordinated ithttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsmxawaannouncementthetimercvjmbd I and I think a lot of people just thought it was kind of weird But was it coordinated and if so were the results what you were hoping for Anything to say about the servers more specifically about improving them Errors are way too often Why is the front page so slow to update now I used to come here for breaking news now a shooting doesnt show up on the front page until the next day Is there any chance you guys are ever going to take a look at the  rule for self promotionhttpswwwredditcomwikiselfpromotion and revise it a bit to make it more fair to creative people who legitimately have something to share to the reddit community I ask because I know that rule is turning a lot of creative people away from reddit because recently any posts about what theyre currently working on tend to get deleted Theres a difference between spamming  links to a blog nobody cares about full of ads and say an indie game developer who makes  game every couple of years and wants to tell people about it and answer questions but doesnt necessarily want to have to post  advice animals in the mean time This isnt my main account its just the one I post on the most because I dont really want reddit posts on my other account showing up in google searches for my name SO I just use the other one to talk about stuff Im working on not spam one post once in a while and when they dont get deleted for self promotion they get upvoted a lot and people seem to enjoy them and I answer questions and participate in the discussions Or I used to at least Its been difficult lately At least there seems to be quite a double standard where anyone SUPER FAMOUS AND POPULAR already gets a free pass for promoting their works on reddit celebrity AMAs and people like JimKB whereas all the little guys who cant afford massive marketing campaigns for their works get shunned away and basically told that reddit doesnt value their work Im not the only onehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvNvUjfCZUzg who thinks this If you want specific complaints about the  rule its  comments dont count  posts from many years ago before this rule was strict count against it  posts in subreddits that WANT original content and posts from creators like rgamedev count against you in all other subreddits  posts on alternate accounts dont count I like keeping my business account separated since I dont want people to easily see like my political opinions and stuff  the rule just encourages people to either spam up advice animals or lie about being the author my friend just made or use sockpuppet accounts All of these seem less valuable to me than letting authors be honest about it and it makes reddit a worse place as a result  A spambot or true spammer can get around a rule like  of posts must not be self promotion with bots and scripts and proxies and sockpuppets really easily so this rule just ends up targeting honest creatives who are proud of what they made and want to share it with a site they visit every day When is the search tool going to be less awful Reddit Live threads are really useful but have not gained much adoption because they are exclusively hosted on rlive Linking to the thread from a different subreddit is not great because the link has to be submitted like any other external link The moderators of the subreddit that the link was submitted to then have no editorial control over what happens in the live thread since it isnt actually on their subreddit Are there any changes planned for how Reddit Live works Specifically will we be able to create Reddit Live threads on any subreddit at some point Heres a good post and discussion regarding how Reddit Live can be improvedhttpswwwredditcomrlivecommentshfrhrequestredditliveneedsproperstandardization Hey Steve I recently learned about the limitations of the front page where I only view  of the subreddits I subscribed to at a time on my front page I understand I could purchase gold to increase this to  but this feels like a very deceptive practice The feature isnt really documented unless you go digging and honestly it feels like a limitation a website of Reddits caliber simply should not have Any chance this limit will go away in the future Has the new system of quarantining subreddits worked as you hoped it would Do you think it improves the way reddit is viewed in the public eye EDIT uIpMedia brings up a good point Do advertisers want to buy more adspace on reddit now that this system is in place deleted deleted Why is there no sitewide spoiler tagging Almost every community that is concerned with spoilers has their own CSS hack to hide it but it doesnt work on mobile doesnt show up when you arent browsing from that sub and isnt terribly standardized Some subs have started using the NSFW tagging to hide spoiler thumbnails but that also has flaws because it still gets filtered as NSFW doesnt hide the title and cant be marked as both NSFW and spoilers other than manually through the post title Please  Make spoiler tags sitewide  Allow users to showhide all spoiler posts like how you can showhide all NSFW posts  Allow individual subs to disallow spoiler posts Two weeks ago three noteworthy posts made it to the top of rfunny all within  hours This is onehttpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsnpngtheyvegonetoplaid this is anotherhttpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsntisawthismannequinattargettheotherday and I cant find the third right now All three of these posts had a funny picture from Target and all three quickly made it to the front page with  upvotes and at the time only  comments To a user this seems like guerrilla marketing My questions Is Target or a Target marketing company doing this knowingly with reddits permission Is reddit in any way assisting these companies tacitly or explicitly If reddit isnt involved do you care that this is happening Do you hopeplan to stophinder it What happened to the promise that some of reddits profits were going to be distributed back to the members in some way Why do you allow one guy to be a moderator of over  subreddits I think it was  and ban people from all of them using bots eg someone posts something the guy does not like in  subreddit and he bans that person from all other subreddits Are you planning to allow users of the common subreddits to vote for their moderators In many subreddits like rhearthstone the moderators are basically the first people who created the subreddit with a popular name and people join and join based on simple subreddit name not merit just like in internet before google era where people would write noun  com and try to find a page about something now it is r  noun Are you planning to finally allow users to kick out moderators of those big subreddits Here is an example of users requesting a removal of a moderator due to poor moderation quality  guess what the moderator removed the topic which got  upvotes in around  hour from being posted httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonecommentsiecpetitiontoremoveudeviouskatasamodofthis Any plans for an Android version of Alien Blue The search function is still wonky Subs with longer names show up before subs with shorter names even when the search query exactly matches the shorternamed sub For example when I search MidCentury MidCenturyHome is the first result even though it is practically a dead sub and the sub I was looking for matches my query exactly Not a huge deal obviously but still annoying and worth fixing Anything you could foreshadow as to what community tools we might expect  rredditrequest was added as a stopgap measure  years ago Currently someone can squat on large and active subreddit communities without any involvement in that subreddit whatsoever as long as they log into their account once every  months  What would it take for the admins to look at new procedures for removing inactive and unresponsive moderators who arent part of the communities theyre supposed to act on behalf of   When the default set of subreddits was changed to encompas  subreddits a year or so ago rather than about  the promise was that changes could be made more often to ensure that things stay fresh and that reddit is an interesting website also for those who dont have accounts I think that was at least in part a response to how overdue the undefaulting of subreddits like rpolitics radviceanimals and ratheism took place The longer a community is a default and passively builds up users even if mods are failing at running the community the harder it is to fix those problems afterwards  What would it take to look at the current default subreddits and potential changes to them corollary geodefualts dont seem to have received any support in the last year or so either Are they technically still in beta   The  US midterm election wasnt covered in the default subreddits That means that to follow US politics on reddit you have to have an account A large proportion of redditors dont For a site that takes a stance on political issues like marriage equality and an open and free internet it seems strange that not all users are exposed to that content even if its the regional politics of the location youre in geodefaults  What would it take to cover the  US presidential election in the defaults in some way What happened to getting rid of shadow banning deleted Id like a response to the autobanning bots being utilized by roffmychest  I made a post in rkotakuinaction yesterday and received the following message despite never posting nor visiting roffmychest You have been automatically banned for participating in a hate subreddit rkotakuinaction is known to harass individuals andor communities including this one I am a bot and I cannot determine context but you support the hate subreddit by providing content to it The moderators are willing to reverse the ban only if you plan to stop supporting rkotakuinaction If you do not then do not contact us deleted Why did you ban rpomf and rlolicons but not rsexwithdogs Are you saying fucking animals isnt as bad as sexual depictions of imaginary characters Edit lo and behold my question goes unanswered Why do shadow bans still exist We had your assurance that it was one of the foremost things you were looking into that that you hated the concept of it so how come it has taken you the management this long to implement something that goes so drastically against what Reddit stands for When will moderation logs be made public for all subs so moderation on reddit can be transparent and accountable What is your opinion on free speech today Do you still believe shadowbanning should be reserved to spammer If so how are you going to change the current system do you agree with the statement Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad even if they are technically legal Does reddit thinks about adding a nsfl button Finally I have a suggestion for subreddits that are weird and make reddit look bad I am not talking about subs that have CP or other illegal things in them There should be an option when creating a subreddit to tag it as NSFL andor Contains potentially offensive content just like there is an option to make every post NSFW These subs would never appear in rAll and there could be a warning when entering the sub just like with NSFW What do you think The search sucksperiod Are there plans to rehaul this  For example try searching Far Cry and Farcry Totally different subreddits available this is only one instance that I ran into recently I kind of was hoping that the main subreddit would be found first Also what is up with the forced mobile sites on portable devices when I search in google Given the recent moderation drama in rgaming and rgames related to TotalBiscuit posts does Reddit plan to implement any sort of communitybased moderator policing There have been many instances where the moderators of a subreddit went against the wishes of the members of that subreddit deleting topics silencing discussion appointing people to act as mods against the wishes of the community and I feel that there needs to be some sort of community oversight especially for large subs The tired answer of if you dont like the moderation of a sub just create a new one isnt a solution because it punishes the community for the actions of a mod Hey Steve any plansdesire to build out the East Coast presence a little more with the workforce Im sure a lot of qualified people are interested in working for Reddit but dont want to be in the San Francisco area Perhaps you could expand the New York office or set up shop in Silicon Alley outside of Boston deleted What are you doing about inactive top moderators deleted deleted Why did Reddit delete all of the links to the Intercept report on the Drone Papers over the last few days Especially as this should be one of the biggest stories in the US One link to a wired article about it made it to the front page but the site that actually broke the news keeps getting links to it taken down in all of the main subs Whats up with that Why is reddit still censored in Germany rwatchpeopledie is unreachable even though it was proven to you that there is no legal reason to do this httpswwwredditcomrtechnologycommentsgynwuredditisnowcensoringpostsandcommunitiesoncubdjcontext To make it clear I think this subreddit is pretty disgusting but reddit once stood for free speech and now it stands for censorship Some subreddits are moderated very poorly Like very very poorly Will there ever be anything about it that users can do other than leave in masse Which I can only really think of happening in ratheism Its very hard to do anything about bad moderation in especially a default sub or otherwise extremely large ones with broad and singular titles I know some people have issues with askscience for example which has a very unique use on reddit Moderators often dont have to do any work or they can do it extremely poorly with no control because everyone gets funneled in the sub and told its the way to go anyway It really does damage the integrity and reputation of reddit as a serious website when default subs are run on personal opinions by mods who have clearly let the power get to them You know you have some subs that just let a shitty bot do all their work I couldent guess what sub does that and some that ban anything political that isnt praising Bernie Sanders and when these are extremely popular or default subs you cant simply say Well if its bad enough everyone will leave and go somewhere else Are there any news on the Karma soft capping Im really interested in how that is or isnt going to change I have left reddit for Voathttpsvoatco due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumpedup charges The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO despite initial hopes has continued the same trend As an act of protest I have chosen to redact all the comments Ive ever made on reddit overwriting them with this message If you would like to do the same install

GreaseMonkey scripthttpsgreasyforkorgenscriptsredditoverwriteextended Finally click on your username at the top right corner of reddit click on the comments tab and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot After doing all of the above you are welcome to join me on Voathttpsvoatco What are you guys doing to address the downvote bots that are in some subreddits Why did you hire a person incapable of writing coherently to transcribe your AMAs Can you make it so that if I press ignore reports on an entry in the modqueue it actually vanishes from the queue instead of remaining there Right now there seems to be no way to mark a report as yes we heard that we dont care Hey never got a clear answer on this why were the loli subs banned Ill just link to my comment from the announcement herehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsfxaucontentpolicyupdatectsurue What sites do you see as direct competitors How do you feel about the mods of your default site for US news rnews refusing to allow any news stories dealing with the TPP to be posted Are agendadriven mods ruining the credibility of reddit Steve one recommendation id have for these QA sessions is to either take more time to answer each question or dont answer a question if you dont have something of substance to say If you say nothing people assume you didnt see their question or it just got lost in the shuffle But when you give a PR answer like yeah were definitely working on that were making progress were focusing on giving people the tools to X Y Z thats when you get the  point comments that make people think the admins dont give a shit Can you awnser more than softballs Any progress on removing the toxic communitys of rSRS or rSRD or you guys going to continue ignoring it as always while cherry picking who and what you ban Ill check the front page in the morning and then check it at night and its basically the same Whats the deal I feel like it used to have more turnover update Im outta here Thanks for the questions One hour WTF man This is the internet Please bring back rredditcom Can you go back to where RES could show the numbers of upvotes and downvotes Is there a way to make certain subreddits your subscribed to have more or less priority than others Is it just an onoff switch with subscribing I mean i think it would be very cool if users could per say personally rate subs for their own profiles only in order to organize their front page in order a relevant subs that they like Do you guys still force people to move to SF the most expensive housing market in the country Why do you feel justified censoring users voices in underhanded and cowardly ways Shadowbans any one Heres a question I had People have been talking about breaking news showing up on their front page Now aside from the algorithm and post staleness one question I had was could you ever put the top  posts of rall automatically on my front page As I understand it every  minutes I get a random selection of  subreddits onto my front page But if rnews isnt one of those  I may never see this important news It would be cool if the algorithm said For the first  entries on a users front page just give the top  of rall Then from there sort through this selection of  Of course this could be a toggleable user preference deleted The mobile beta site is really awful and exceptionally slow The request desktop site in mobile browsers also doesnt work to take a user to the main version of the site  Is the mobile beta site still being worked on  Is there a way you can make it easier formobile users to get to the desktop site Which is ironically still the best version of the site to use on a mobile device I want to be able to do a search through all my comments or even be able to see them all Will this ever be possible How come when I sort by top posts with a lower score occasionally come before posts with a higher score Doesnt that defeat the whole purpose Can you change it so when I misspell a subreddit URL it doesnt do a redirect to a completely different URL meaning I cant correct my typo easily For example wwwredditcomrstsrcraft Have you thought about going through your tech forums to look for engineers I use the crap out of them for my job as a network engineer Hi Steve Will your transparency report include information on data that Reddit releases to nongovernment organizations Eg PR and marketing firms for analysis and trend reporting to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators As a moderator Im not really sure this happened Look in rModSupport which was suppose to be a communication channel between mods and admins The majority of the topics which are questions have no admin response I have a couple topics in there from weeks ago with no admin comment I sent a modmail to that subreddit  days ago just asking if the subreddit was still planned to be a communication tool between us mods and admins I never got a reply Im losing count of all the having major spam issues questions in rModSupport that receive no admin reply a single response would be enough It seems to have fallen to as little admin participation as rmodtalk gets I dont think Ive heard a peep around whats going on with the antibrigading tools A year ago reddit hired a Community Engineer to rebuild modmail There are literally no signs of progress on this Modmail is one of the most important things for us moderators even having an acknowledgeresolved button would be fantastic rsnoogaming created by an admin remains abandoned by the admins with us moderators trying to pick up the slack I had to pull teeth like no tomorrow to get a basic answer on what the future of this was from an admin perspective This was before you returned though I think I barely hear anything from the admins nowadays I get replies on rredditcom PMs when I contact them about ban evasion but I got replies like that  years ago so things are as they were In the same light AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water There is an error topic stickiedhttpswwwredditcomrAlienBluecommentszrckpbugiamgettingthiserroralmostdailysince and has been for  weeks No fix nor admin comments in the last  days Not only that but with redditcom owning the app now the admins developing that app dont seem to be staying on top of their own reddit changes I dont believe the new subreddit rule system which was in beta for a while is even implemented on the app And as a moderator subreddit rules being front and center on mobile is very important to us If reddit is developing a new system like that dont you think it should be implemented into AlienBlue in parallel Im not trying to pick on individual admins scenarios or people I am trying to show a pattern that is not changing reddit is a professional business Its very concerning There are good things like the new subreddit rules system although its limited to  rules only and sticky comments But communication doesnt seem improved Its not the end of the world its just things dont feel different outside new mod features AMAs suck now deleted theres been some recent anxiety about reddit attempting to monetize user posts through publishing will there be a a policy addressing the kind of content that reddit might seek to publish and generate future revenue or is it anything is up for grabs Anyone else feel like this was the year reddit became less of a community and more of just another facebook of sorts I remember when I first joined reddit three years ago there were a ton of key users on this site who would post frequently would have gifstags to distinguish themselves as karma whores or what have you and most would add something to a post Im not talking just about novelty accounts either Just guys that were around enough to make reddit comments more interesting Now everything is predictable Not that it was difficult to predict a cute cat video going to the top in the past but now it just seems mainstreamed There arent any posts that seem legendary anymore No AMAs of people drawing sex positions of a guy with two dicks No Tom Cruise threads No I have a request threads Shit I cant even find those on the smaller subs I frequent Im not being specific I just want some more flavor that would remind me that reddit is a community rather another vent of popsocial culture Its for these reasons that I no longer browse the Front page I dont even look in AMAs anymore because theyre all dry af Interesting and different threads no longer make it to the top What happened It does seem like the Reddit community has become more bitter and divided with some groups actively protesting against moderators and large communities Do you have any plans to try to address the gap between groups like moderators and subredditcancerundelete Hi Steve are there any plans in place to deal with the server overload that occurs during peak hours As a mod theres been a huge increase in spam lately Reporting spammers via rspam seems to be hit or miss and its not clear if theres any way to report entire spam domains which would make everything so much easier Modmails and username summons in rspam usually go unanswered You acknowledged that theres a spam problem but what are you planning to actually do about it We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities We are still in transition but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress We know we have a lot to do here So in a community where a lot of debate and back and forth happen how do you feel you will be able to separate abuse and threats vs hot headed argumentative people who cant seem to just hug it out Hi Steve Are you looking at changing up the default subreddits at all or no EDIT Of course the gold chain starts right after me You guys are like the Google release notes of content moderation All silent action no explanation to what the hell is going on AMAs while still pulling in quite a lot of upvotescomments seem pretty gutted compared to what they were prior to Victoria being let go Is this something you guys have recognized or am I not seeing the whole picture EDIT uallthefoxes was kind enough to point out this job postinghttpsjobslevercoredditcaabcdacdebb That was a lot of words to use to say that little deleted Reddit has a history of banning users rather opaquely such as by means of the still wellknown shadowban What will users see and not see during  when the TS team deems a user to have violated a rule Would be nice to have some sort of accountability for mods who consistently abuse their positions especially when they do it for the sake of being able to do it in the first place Looking at you Mr  of them are great In fact Ive not had any personal encounters myself that were anything other than respectful Im referring to some very very toxic examples that can be seen sprinkled throughout the communities at any given time Hi Steve Could you explain a bit on what this Trust and Safety team is about and what they do Thanks for the update For those concerned about privacy if you want to delete your old comments you need to edit them to  instead of deleting them Reddit does not actually delete comments when you ask them to it just hides them from everyone except Reddit employees and probably government requests Reddit does not store revision histories for comments so editing it will remove the previous version from Reddits servers deleted Is it just me or does this seem pretty blank It does not seem like much advancement will be happening in  Is there going to be any word on why some subreddits that dont break Reddit rules are banned while subreddits that are obviously brigadingbreaking the rules are not Spez Ive got one Are there plans to initiate a sort of Mod Code of Conduct There are increasing problems with Mods of certain subreddits banning users from postingcommenting not based on the users behavior in their sub but rather the fact that the user posted or commented in completely unrelated subs that that Mod doesnt personally like So a user can get a message banning them from rdurpadurp because the mods of rdurpadurp noticed that said user also posted or commented on something in rhurpahurp and rhurpahurp just makes them sad Despite the fact that in most cases Ive seen people speak of it doesnt appear that our example user broke any of rdurpadurpss rules or misbehaved there The mods of some of these subs are engaging in thought and speech policing outside of their subs If Reddit is serious about putting on its big boy pants and maturing as a platform youre really going to need to create a Mod policy that will prevent Mods from running their Subs as personal safe spaces excluding users based on activities outside of their purview Related to this there needs to be a way for Reddit proper to remove Moderators who refuse to follow these basic guidelines Well its their sub is unacceptable when youre allowing someones personal hiccups preclude open communication for capricious reasons Wow This is just like a shitty meeting at my office  A lot of words to say practically nothing  Include as many buzzwords as possible  Total waste of everyones time  Mandatory viewingattendance even if you dont care  Reads like someone spent a lot of time on it trying to justify his job while everyone else can plainly see its worthless So todays the day that slacking off from work on Reddit became just as bad as not slacking off at work on Reddit News subs such as rworldnews are anything but news as they are very heavily brigaded httpiimgurcomubmYGepng and MODs dont seem to be the one in charge Before every other post was about Muslims after that it was ISIS after that refuges and today  posts about the Iranian leader and the holocausts The postings are very heavily manipulated and it is pointless for your average redditor to say anything at all without getting heavily downvoted Do you have any plans to remedy this anomaly Steve why does it seem that although the soft cap limit changes were undone posts are still staying at the top of my front page for  hours on a regular basis and getting  upvotes Add back in individual upvote and downvote counts A t to symbolize controversy doesnt tell me shit and I want to know if Im at  and  or  and  It was a mistake back then and it still sucks now Well that was a lot of fluff tldr were doing stuff be prepared Are you planning to address the widespread mod abuse For example the drama that went on in rpunchablefaces where a mod took it over and started banning people not just in that subreddit but across multiple subreddits they manage I mean its great youre giving us these tools but there needs to be some sort of empowerment of the regular reader as well Too many communities are being bullied by these mods We all have our pet theories on why nothing has been done on it up until now but this is a longstanding issue with certain subreddits like SRS and SRD that the admin team has specifically avoided AB testing system Are different users experiencing different versions of reddit without their input EDIT AB testing explained in this new admin post over in rchangeloghttpswwwredditcomrchangelogcommentsnaredditchangeabtestingreadnext for those who are interested Reddit took an industrychanging stance on involuntary pornography Could you and the rest of the admin team please stop with this ridiculous and intellectually dishonest self aggrandizement Reddit is in fact not a socially progressive stimulator of social change It is a corporate control business entity that made such a change to increase its public reputation and also limit its exposure to litigation I support the change in policy it is the right thing to do But such a change wasnt precipitated by a deep sense of social correctness it was the result of several changes in law and a general agreement in the media as a whole We as a community dont like when the Admins try and pull the moral high ground Its unnecessary and it doesnt come off as truthful If the admin team could change anything in the next year stopping the constant need to justify reddit through such unnecessary constructs as moral rightness would be a good start I feel the admin team has lost touch with its community This is but one example of it Sorry if I came off as a dick but this is how I feel We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments We take our stewardship of your data seriously and we know transparency is important to you which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report This will be available in March It would be nice of reddit list every single agency that requested info For instance instead of  subpeona for user info put  subpeona from the Houston FBI Branch Office for user info This is ture transparency A lot of the default mods seemingly wantdemand more mod tools to make their jobs easier Could we the regular users also have tools to hold the moderators to account more easier Transparancy logs for example I read We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit as We appreciate your patience while we monetize Reddit I had to read it again to make sure you guys werent being Freudianly honest Whats up with all the censorship in rworldnews and rvideos Basically mods just delete a post or autohide posts that are NOT against the rules Its so bad that theres a subreddit designed solely to show you what the front page looks like without moderation and then link you to the articles via rRedditMinusMods And its not just worldnews its every subreddit im talking about posts that get  or  points this is just from today httpiimgurcomXwvnpCpng  Perhaps implement something on reddit which makes a post immutable after it reaches a certain amount of points Of course with the exception of spam Or even a review process if a mod wants to hidedelete a post have someone else review it even a random mod in their own subreddit at least  people involved will end the dictator like style these mods are going through Hi uspez sorry if Im a little late Ive noticed an increase as of late in an increasing of individuals using mod powers to ban people automatically for using other subs Is this an ability you plan on continuing to allow And in service of transparency this is when youre going to bring back visible upvotedownvote counts right Any comments about subreddits that are under control by corporations or individuals with a financial incentive to mislead users I am mostly refering to subreddits like rrocketleague and rleagueoflegends that have huge impact by the developers of those products There are MANY other subreddits that have this problem as well This is also a problem is other subreddits like a moderator deleting all mentions of a competitors product while the subreddit owner actually sells a product that gets talked about in the sub frequently This is a growing problem as corporations want to control how their product is viewed and more and more corporations are moderating the reddit community Im going to copy paste this old commenthttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentspshhceosteveheretoanswermorequestionscwld into every new rannouncements thread until something gets done  Why is there no sitewide spoiler tagging Almost every community that is concerned with spoilers has their own CSS hack to hide it but it doesnt work on mobile doesnt show up when you arent browsing from that sub and isnt terribly standardized Some subs have started using the NSFW tagging to hide spoiler thumbnails but that also has flaws because it still gets filtered as NSFW doesnt hide the title and cant be marked as both NSFW and spoilers other than manually through the post title  Please   Make spoiler tags sitewide   Allow users to showhide all spoiler posts like how you can showhide all NSFW posts   Allow individual subs to disallow spoiler posts Hello a nice reminder but it looked like a Previously on reddit kinda post rather than a future plans I know you have a plenty of stuff working on out and you just want question so i ask only this When will the search get some fixes Im tired of constantly using google to search something in reddit I dont even want very specific detailed post or something like that Just type Pretty Girls in the search and youll see what i mean and sorry about my English if its too hard to understand Hi Steve Can we have a way to permanently opt out of reddit mobile Its worse in literally every way compared to main site and Im tired of having to switch all my search results from mobile to desktop I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong  A phrase we will be using a lot around here is Look Forward Yeah  I wouldnt want to think about what happened last year either Cant wait to see how much more boring you guys can make Reddit in  I doubt you can top this last year Hi Have yall noticed some subreddits made exclusively for spamming ExamplehttpswwwredditcomrfAdFic There are a few others which I cant find at the moment but please look into this Also how do I report them deleted Is there a way we can have the quarantine CSS disabled if were subscribed to a subreddit I know rgore is so offensive and all but I would really love to view it without my eyes bleeding Are your policies regarding requests from law enforcement and governments anything other than tell them to get a warrant and send it to our lawyers deleted Any plans to retire the old Comodore  and upgrade to a modern server uspez  I know im late to the post but can you guys look at changing the algorithm for posts on the front page I often see the same posts in the top  for  hours I know you constantly deny it but this has not always been the case in fact i remember a number of years ago on another account where it was about a hour limit I know your argument in the past has been that oneaday visitors benefit from it this way but many of us are on it fairly constantly and have to trawl through new and all and random to get new content Perhaps there could be another filter for hot such as Hot today and Hot Now We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments We take our stewardship of your data seriously and we know transparency is important to you which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report This will be available in March i dont even want to know how badly threw us under the bus Spam and abuse threaten Reddits communities We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities We are still in transition but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress We know we have a lot to do here no you catered to whiny self entitled hate group and said fuck you to anyone who doesnt agree with the group when will you address the issues with your mods abusing the power provided to them and their censoring of OUR content which you have decided to sell on our behalf to line your wallets FUCK YOU REDDIT ADMINS SERIOUSLY FUCK YOU YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH SOGGY CUNT SCABS Have you considered placing a limit on the number of subreddits a user can moderate It seems like control of the largest subreddits are being concentrated in the hands of only a few individuals Its not uncommon to see one person have full control over  subreddits many of which with  subscribers Is there anything being planned to address this  Reddits mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish Haha Good one Did the other board members and shareholders laugh at this one Reddits  mission is to try and figure out a way to make some fucking money without the annoying cunts that use it kicking up a big fussotherwise Ill be out on my arse too  more accurate Hi Steve Did you notice many nonEnglish speaking people are coming to reddit Well really be happy if you develop more multibyte character handling in the site features more precisely      I got a one day suspension yesterday I noticed a post about Amy Schumers joke stealing had been removed from the front page and decided to try and find out why This led me to rundelete where someone had already posted about the situation and the mods motivation in deleting the thread while leaving many other similar threads that werent on the front page of rall alone I read through that thread and the mods posts on it and decided I really didnt believe the mod had deleted the thread in good faith and downvoted his comments on it Not really much else I could do on it since there is no real recourse on Reddit when it comes to Mod abuse so I just went on with my day When I came back from lunch my account was suspended for brigading So when there are entire subs devoted to brigading like SRS I get suspended for downvoting a mod who was abusing his mod privileges I contested the suspension and no one even bothered responding I feel like the Admins are turning a blind eye to Mods who abuse their power and take down stuff on the front page because it goes against their politics or other petty reasons and going to the other extreme of silencing people who dont like it Wish there was a way to take back the money I spent on Reddit gold on this account and others I hate feeling powerless and I hope a good alternative to Reddit comes around soon because I dont believe the Admins actually care about these issues rant We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments We take our stewardship of your data seriously and we know transparency is important to you which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report This will be available in March The way this is grouped together makes me question if this means youre planning to increase cooperation with law enforcement There are quite a few subreddits discussingpromoting very illegal things by US law such as drug users sex workers and animal diddlers From what I understand theyre careful to toe the line in public but I honestly dont know Are these subreddits on their way out next Are the posters there going to be at risk of having their data handed over to the authorities deleted Thanks for taming the wild beast that was reddit Its now safe calm and above all bland In  I used to click on about  or more of all posts Today I click on about  and most those have no edge Even the listed subreddits at the top of the page is bland Gone are wtf atheism and even politics replaced by such pulsereducing offerings as television mildly interesting and aww Cutting edge really No not really Maybe reddit should get a new name to go with its new look I suggest Glass of Warm Milk Remove quarantines from all subs make mods police according to actual rules instead of agendas and require those rules to be clearly defined welcome all content that is legal to post do away with vote fuzzing and show the  for all comments and unfuck whatever you did that A makes the front page sit unchanged for hours and B makes me turn my television on to get news updates because Reddit is somehow often behind the news curve now Basically leave it to the users to generate and promote content like was always done before and watch Reddit suddenly stop sucking so much Hey Steve Are you thinking of introducing some of the features of RES to the vanilla website For example it would be great to be able to modify the top bar without needing an extension Ive got Alien Blue on my iOS I see that youve decided to fill every scrolling page with at least one Sponsored Ad post Have you provided a way for me to block these or am I required to pay for a different app to do this Fix the front page shit is mad stagnant Also WorldNews censorship was too much with that many subscribers a certain level of quality is expected This year will include even MORE CAT FACTS While many parts of Europe and North America consider the black cat a sign of bad luck in Britain and Australia black cats are considered lucky Wow how brave of you to come out against involuntary pornography  we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging And there it is Not the Reddit community not the Reddit platform the Reddit product Can we fire the rpolitics mods and get new ones It literally is rsandersforpresident Its a huge propaganda machine I want a subreddit that talks about POLITICS The good the bad The left the right and center Not just sanders is jesus sanders just saved a puppy DAE love Sanders Hi Steve are there any plans for guidelines for when moderators themselves become abusive Ive seen many examples like the recently resolved rxkcd debacle where nobody but the mod themselves benefited and the community suffered because of it Can you please make it so that OPs on self posts have their replies shown by default rather than being hid in load more comments Having to have the OPs that would be you here overview open just to see their comments is super annoying and its a quick change that would instantly improve things What kind of requests from law enforcement and governments Im not sure I know what youre referencing or if I should THIS JUST IN Over  random throwaways were hacked You want my reddit account Have it and keep the change you filthy animal I dont even remember my current password If you change it to NSAoptout the government legally cant read your comments If anyone stole my password can you please tell me what it is I forgot Thank you What if Heartbleed is a trick and really all the newly changed passwords are being captured And here comes the deluge of hunter jokes deleted Thanks I work as a SysAdmin elsewhere for those out there that want to check if a site may be affected you can use httpsfilippoioHeartbleed If a site you use is affected you shouldnt even use the website until they fix it PS this is looking like a comment graveyard already yeesh What should I change it to Im one step ahead of them I use a password for Reddit that has already been compromised on a number of other sites Take that hackers FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME Honestly the only reddit account worth stealing would be uunidan Question Why does it matter if someone finds out my reddit password Whats the worst thing that can happen Just posting as me No one reads what I say anyway its mostly for my own amusement Is there any evidence that anyone has used heartbleed to get information deleted httpxkcdcom Goodness knows I wouldnt want anyone to see all the subreddits I subscribe to deleted Well then again unless you explicitely use payredditcom Reddit doesnt even use https to begin with so a MITM attack to get credentials wouldnt be hard at all in anyways Im really hoping we get full SSL by default soon Im afraid someone who stole my login details might use my account to post cat pictures to reddit nahhh too lazy removed If we changed our passwords yesterday for example is that safe enough Or was the system declared completely safe only today Sorry if this is a really ignorant question Regarding that linked xkcd Is that actually true Is it only password lengthrandomness that matters I mean I have a password similar to that in the first frame of the xkcd its  random scrambled letters upper  lower  special characters and  numbers I have no difficulty remembering it Ive had it for years but it still concerns me that correcthorsebatterystaple might be safer Can some computer whiz ELI it for me I know basic terms such as rainbowtables bruteforce etc but other than that please keep it as layman as possible And when I do change my password I type in my new password click save and get a Page Not Found error Brilliant Id love to change my password deleted Finally my username is relevant I wont be changing my password I like living on the edge I dont even know my password because it fills itself in  Its cool I changed it as soon as I took control of this account I meanfuck Id just like thank Reddit for being good guys and not insisting I use a number an uppercase letter a lowercase letter a character from the katana and an emoji that doesnt resolve to a face but more importantly for not limiting the password field length Thanks for the heads up but given that Reddit operates in plaintext HTTP most of the time Im not really more worried now than I was before I am however worried about the technical competence of Reddit for taking Heartbleed seriously but otherwise using SSL in very nearly the least correct way possible Dear Reddit If you want us to care about our account security you should at least give us an option for SSL to begin with SSLatloginonly is a great way to expose all your users all the time to session hijacking Because of the way Reddit works customized homepage and all I suspect most Reddit users stay logged in which means were carrying around session cookies for a long time with long expiry times A password theft would be more dangerous except that by default Reddits loginsignup page is delivered over plaintext also Even if the password is theoretically submitted over SSL a MITM on the login form could steal passwords even before Heartbleed And this cant be purely accidental httpssslredditcom redirects to httpwwwredditcom which tells me that this insecure mode is very much intended Heartbleed is worse and I suppose its conceivable that someone grabbed all our passwords right out of RAM But should I really be caring when anyone on the same Starbucks wifi could just launch Firesheep and steal my sessionhttparvtardcomfiresheepprofileforreddit I dont even remember my password  maybe the hackers could hook me up with it hahaha How can I change my password if I dont know my password S Genuine question my email address isnt linked and I have noo clue what my password is deleted Phew Changing my password to hunter as we speak thanks Ill take the chance Successfully changed my password to unicorn Hope it is safe now Thanks for the warning  I wont HAVE AT ME HACKERS Changed password from password to  Thank you I am fairly confident my account is of no use to anyone even me but thanks for the heads up Oh no my useless karma The Karma Oh wont somebody think of the Karma  LastPasshttpwwwlastpasscom is a great site for password management You decrypt the info on your computer so all your stuff is safe on their site They even have a nifty little random password generatorhttpslastpasscomgeneratepasswordphp that anyone can use to make a super duper secure password I highly recommend using this to switch passwords and manage them once the sites you use roll out the openSSL patch  Who the hell gave the admin gold I cant Whenever I click save I get redirected to httpssslredditcompostupdate which says page not found Knowing my luck Im going to get hacked and someone else is going to get more karma than Id ever dream of getting I dont even know my password Ok password changed to password now Thanks for the advice what exatly happens if someone logs in as me they just make me like things I dont really like Ill take my chances good friend Thanks Obama Oh no all my sensitive data that I for some reason share with reddit is vulnerable How do i know youre not the hacker making this post Done Ive changed my password to thsmypssword  Ha Jokes on you guys I dont even know my reddit password Why dont we just all post our passwords in this thread so the community can judge if they are save  Ill start Mine is cookielover i think i speak for all of us when i say im too lazy to change my password im not going to change it unless you force me to I use reddit like the division wall of a bathroom stall and see no need to change its password Reddit gold and reddit points and reddit upvotes who needs it and I mean really this is the equivalent of the highschool popularity type of mentality YOURE NOT MY SUPERVISOR Can someone dumb down the Heartbleed bug down for me EDIT Yes I read the XKCD comic If these assholes hacked my Reddit they would post better Memes and get more Karma  Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Our most important

rSHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIITT For the sake of transparency I feel like it would be best to make the list of banned communities public With all of the concerns lately about the admins not being transparent enough banning subs without telling us who they are seems counterproductive deleted Will you be sharing information about the communities which are Quarantined Will moderators of those communities know if their subreddit has been affected Edit Just as its not immediately obvious rCoontown has been banned Edit  Heres what it looks like when you try to access a Quarantined subreddithttpsimgurcomBkUsoz Edit  And heres what private subs now look like Fancyhttpsimgurcomkfptkw If a user is subscribed to a Quarantined subreddit will it still appear on their front page deleted the average redditor Yikes Opting into offensive subs Do we opt into each offensive sub Or is there a opt into offensive subs button Like a NSFW filter only for offensive material  Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is the best place online to have truly authentic conversations If you do plan to ban subs Im sure reddit would enjoy an itemized list of ban reasonsoffenses by each sub This shouldnt necessarily include a link or something to an example of the offense but the list provided should be detailed enough for a reasonable person to say OK yeah thats clear enough to require the ban But the bans should definitely be released and reasons for them made clear Any plans to deal with moderator abuse in some of the larger subs like rnews or rpolitics  Certain mods will delete comments and hand out bans for advancing political opinions or posting stories they disagree with For example rnews is notorious for censoring stories related to the TPP Also what about plans to deal with mods who mod   or even more than  subs Clearly theyre simply in it for the power and cant even pretend to be able to actually moderate that many especially that many large or default subs These things make reddit worse as a space much more than some of the rather spurious claims people are making in the rest of this thread Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Will there be a clear list of banned subreddits From an information security standpoint How will you be storing the data about what quarantined subreddits Ive opted into In the event of a security breach how easily could this information be associated with my verified email This page httpswwwredditcomaboutalien says that  Remember reddit is always lowercase But your Content Policy spells it with a capital R has this branding changed deleted  Encourages or incites violence  Threatens harasses or bullies or encourages others to do so Are these going to be used against communities that are centered around the preexisting hatred or dislike of a group or person I realize this is nit picking but this is still fairly vague What constitutes encouragement or how will you decide what incites someone to action Im surprised reddit is okay with actual beastiality but lolicon goes too far LMFAO Can you add a permanent optin Im not really offended by anything so it seems silly to warn me about things that other people may find offensive Just add a setting or something to ignore the quarantine Holy crap that content policy is vague  A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor So a quarantine happens when you believe that at least  of reddit users would be extremely offended or upset by a community Seeing as how were a pretty liberal secular crowd Id like you to please quarantine subreddits relating to religion and conservative politics I and arguably  of reddit find them upsetting  Photographs videos or digital images of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct taken without your permission So revenge porn and rTheFappening is OK since the photos were taken with permission and only later used without permission  Do not post content that incites harm against people or groups of people What the hell is harm Only physical injury and illegal acts or does it also cover any negative impact such as loss of income or emotional distress Further when does somebody incite harm If I make a post in goodfaith that tends to increase the likelihood a person or group will be harmed have I violated this policy  Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic andor continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them Like harm this policy abuses the word safety What does it mean Only physical safety or the safety of my ideas a la safespaceshttpenwikipediaorgwikiSafespace As if that isnt enough youve apparently created an exception to the content policy within its first hour   we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Ridiculously this standard for banning is easier to meet than the standard for quarantining And it gets even worse when your later comments implicitly change the and to an or Reddits content policy now seems to ban any content or communities that generally make Reddit worse You cant get more vague than that I also take serious issue with how quarantines are implemented Its a generally good idea to keep certain welldefined categories of content isolated But requiring login and email confirmation isnt so much quarantining as it is imposing arbitrary standards to make it harder for the communities to exist Why not also start limiting their comments to  characters just for kicks You could achieve a quarantine using much more narrowly tailored meansjust require a NSFWlike confirmation per subreddit exclude them from rall and block search engines from indexing In short Im extremely disappointed Not so much because of the policy itself but because of how youve misled the community into thinking that Reddit was truly interested in community feedback and in creating clear standards Youve created a content policy with a bunch of words but an overriding exception that boils down to if we dont like it Is involuntary pornography How will this affect stuff like ramateur and rrealgirls and rSluttyHalloween  Create quarantine subs then turns around and bans subreddit Why bother creating quarantines in the first place How will this affect rhulkhogan brother Where is the proposed transparency I was not a supporter of coontown but I would like to know what policy rules they violated along with concrete examples shown to justify outright banning rather than quarantining To my knowledge it was a subreddit where likeminded individuals could discuss an issue they felt strongly on It certainly never showed up in my feed If I wanted to participate I would have had to look this subreddit up which is how most special interest subreddits work You have to look for them Sure the majority of people are not interested but you cant remove a discussion group because people who have never looked for it might be offended If the group discussed scenarios and issues amongst themselves without forcing their ideas on others or endangering anyone then this group should be allowed no matter how distasteful you find it If it violated these principles I want to be able to see that Tell me why explicitly Transparency Yeah its a lot of work but its important Give me examples on each and every banned subreddit so that I can better follow the rules rcoontown will be reclassified The content there is offensive to many but does not violate our current rules for banning SourcehttpsarchiveisqyOC You specifically said that it wont be banned I dont care for the subreddit myself but your constant lack of consistency doesnt encourage trust between the users and admins Regarding Quarantining Would you ever quarantine a large subreddit like rwtf  A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor One could argue that the very gorey types of pictures edit and videos like of people dying that appear on rwtf would be pretty upsetting I know Ive accidentally clicked on rwtf images when I temporarily disabled my own RES filters and honestly of all things on the site some of the stuff there is more troubling to me than discriminatory self text posts The purpose of quarantining is not to protect users from content Thats asinine people dont end up on rcoontown by accident Its to undermine their sense of security by forcing them to opt in to questionable content meaning if their email verified account is ever linked to their real identities they can be ided as racists pedophiles etc This limits the growth of those communities and makes it harder for sponsors to see them So many subreddits now have to be banned because of the new policy I wonder if all of them will actually be banned or if the admins are just nitpicking what they want to get rid of deleted  A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor or to ourselves Does this also mean that reddit is endorsing any subreddits they choose not to quarantine or ban since they are now individually censoring subreddits deleted deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk I am surprised nobody has mentioned that by collecting emails for quarentined subs you are essentially creating a database of users who read content you deem questionable What does verifying the email accomplish This seems overly broad and Orwellian I have left reddit for Voathttpsvoatco due to years of adminmod abuse and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views This account was over five years old and this site one of my favorites It has officially started bringing more negativity than positivity into my life As an act of protest I have chosen to redact all the comments Ive ever made on reddit overwriting them with

you are welcome to join me on Voathttpsvoatco So long and thanks for all the fish  truly authentic conversations Well if that isnt the biggest piece of shit corporate speak Ive ever heard Can you give us any examples of specific subreddits that will be quarantined What kind of world do you want where people are protected from uncomfortable ideas How do you expect one to grow and develop as a human Padding the walls of reality to spare those too comfortable in their small sphere on the internet a platform that was meant to expose everyone to the world I have to say though I think the quarantine idea is a good balance the ban policy looks a lot more like content censorship that anything else If thats the way the site will be run thats your prerogative but it seems like we keep sidestepping the issue while simultaneously getting closer to bans for content I know weve moved past the concept of reddit being a forum for free speech but lets go one step further and approach this honestly How do you reconcile a policy strictly against communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else with the subreddit bans from today If offensive ideas falls under this umbrella why not just say we are banning offensive ideas I feel like the language about harassment and annoyance is a thin veil that started as a narrow definition but is now expanding to just mean offensive I feel like I called this two months ago when this whole debacle started I guarantee this is what is happening Banning the blatantly racist subs etc would be too obviously based on disagreement with viewpoints  they are moving slowly and widening the meaning of harassing subreddits as they go I dont really disagree with this decision by the way  I just feel like the reasons put forth continue to be disingenuous deleted How do we opt in for EVERYTHING Not that I agree with everything but I come to reddit to get an uncensored exposure to all the web has to offer  I really would like to keep it that way How do it prevent you from babysitting me if I know Im a grown adult and accept all that comes with it tldr  how do I set my account to offend me please deleted Why is the TPP being heavily censored on reddit Please ban rvideos and rworldnews Both subs engaged in harassing behavior directed at the dentist who killed Cecil the lion Reddits policies define harassment as follows Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic andor continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them The Cecil story remained in the news long enough that the comment trends ought to be considered continued actions The comments directed at the dentist were meant to demean him The dentist could also reasonably believe that Reddit is not a safe platform for him to express his ideas or participate in the conversation The harassment rules include no exceptions for public figures or subjects of news stories They do not require direct contact with the victim Here is a sample of comments that have appeared on these subs Comments from the Jimmy Kimmel cliphttpsnpredditcomrvideoscommentsezwjpjimmykimmelhadaperfectandtouchingresponse on rvideos Poachers and people who support poachers should all be fucking

your annoying splash page with a click through link I shouldnt need to give you my email just because someone else is offended by the content We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor Who is this average redditor What are their demographics What are their political beliefs What are their religious backgrounds Does this mean if the average redditor becomes someone with racist views these will be allowed because theyre the average redditor Frankly this is horribly vague and lends itself to easy abuse in the interpretation Youve not defined at all who this magical redditor is uspez Youve just said that youll dictate the entire policy on their views What this should likely read is We will quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the moderator Theres no need to mix the message that you have any information whatsoever on the demographics of the average user of this site with any degree of confidence And I have to say that I have little to no faith that you and your buddies will shy from abusing your station to promote ideological purity and reddit as a safe space Sincerely a gay liberal social worker who thinks that this sounds incredibly totalitarian for a website that pretends to build itself on populism Christ this is so stupid You realize that by taking control of what can and cannot be posted on the site based on moral grounds you thereby imply approval of everything that ISNT removed right So because rcoontown was removed but rkiketown wasnt you are now taking a stand that rkiketown is Reddit approved A year ago none of these subreddits were in my life and now they ALL ARE because of this stupid fucking idea to police them They were already contained and quarantined Now they are not Now its spread everywhere and now Im even sympathetic to their rage at these utterly awful content policy changes So dumb Sooooooshadowbanning Do you shadow ban for violation of content policy violations At what point in the list of punishments would this fall Kojima warned ushttpikymcdncomphotosimagesoriginalbcjpg deleted Changing the conversation away from CT and SRS for a minute why were Loli subs banned They produce no illegal content or anything that violates the new Content Policy They do not harass threaten or worsen anyones Redditing experience I was fully expecting a quarantine and would have been fine with that I understand and respect that Loli is not everyones cup of tea I also get that its your show and we play by your rules but can we get the rule written down somewhere at least Im pretty sure rcirclejerk exists solely to annoy other redditorscmon manthats a really terrible and vague rule Dont we have a right to annoy other people Theres nothing wrong with annoying someone In fact being annoyed is the fault of the one being annoyed Im annoyed by people chewing with their mouths open and its generally unacceptable in the US but in some countries its perfectly acceptable and is encouraged to show respect for the cook You know what the best way to deal with annoying thingspeople is Just ignore them If its not harmful physically or psychologically then whats the harm If its merely annoying just stay away from it And whats the worst you feel from being annoyed UghIm just really bothered by thatIm not offended or upsetjust bothered oy that just really gets under my skin Right winged nuts annoy me can we ban their subreddits I cant stand rguns or rtrees can we ban them too All of their posts feel like they were made solely to annoy me Of course you cant do that So you know what I did I have RES installed and Ive hidden them from showing up on rall Thats it Super simple If its not actually harmful the users should have the choice as to whether or not they see or engage with content they find distasteful Banning something by proclaiming that it exists solely to annoy others is like claiming that youre banning NSFW subreddits that exist solely for inciting sinful sexual thoughts and behavior Sexual thoughts and behavior are basically not harmful and if you dont want to see it you dont have to Maybe instead of banning these types of subreddits they should just get flagged NSFW let the NSFW filter catch it Or create a new filter Im an intellectual property attorney and this Content is illegal if it is against the law for us to host it This includes but is not limited to copyright or trademark infringement illegal sexual content is a complete farce HAVE A LAWYER REVIEW YOUR CONTENT POLICY I cannot tell you what a disastrous definition that is I write these for a living and that is just bloody shameful and embarrassing It is  clear that author of this content policy has  idea what constitutes copyright infringement much less trademark infringement and quite frankly  of reddit relies on content that is arguably infringing but is also fair use By setting up the policy thusly reddit is opening the floodgates to be harassed constantly by completely bullshit DMCA claims that are designed to limit speech Honestly I know we are supposed to be constructive but this policy was written by someone with absolutely zero sophistication or knowledge of law Its pathetic If I were handed this by an associate at my firm I would have to take them aside and give them a lecture on what a piece of bullshit it was in order to prevent them from embarrassing themselves in front of the partners Total crap guys Super disappointed Why not simply announce the real content policy Calvinball Just straight up say fuck you I do what I want It would at least have the advantages of ringing true and never needing to update it again edit conjugation is fun Hm uyishan was right You and AlexishttpsnpredditcomrTheoryOfRedditcommentsdhvknthingsayshewasresponsibleforthechangectfsoicontext really are

beenhttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentscsiwhatsthebestlongconyoueverpulledcszjqg reddit management approves of rcrackertown though Can we get an updated list of the banned subs I dont understand the point of outright banning subs well I get that its for sponsorsimage I just disagree with it Half of the subs people are listing as offensive like rsexwithdogs that have been kept as far as I know right now werent even on my radar The best thing about reddit or Reddit was that you were able to choose from a fuckton of topics and essentially customize your own forum experience Im pretty sure rwatchpeopledie just heard of this one too would be offensive to the average redditorbut the average redditor will probably never fucking go there Id rather have people fucking around on their computers in harmless communities the majority of reddit will never even see than trying to find ways to see this stuff IRL Which brings up the lolicon debate who exactly will be rendered unsafe because of a drawing If anything its an outlet for people Lastly how does it not violate the spirit of Reddit to cater to the average redditor We are a cluster of niche communities some much more exclusive than others If youre only appealing to the average Redditor how will I have a truly authentic conversation if my views differ from those of a young white liberal man I dont mind censorship on Reddit after all it is your platform but it is the hypocrisy that bugs me Banning ideas while saying you only ban actions while certain subreddits actively engage in the actions you say you are preventing but are given free reign I would be so much happier with these decisions if you just straight up told us that you are banning things the board members dont like are rundelete and rModerationLog safe I guess what Im saying is do not under any circumstances let the default sub mods have any input at all into this policy or which subs are banned rworldnews  rnews  and rtechnology are basically trying to censor all of Reddit and they must be completely shut out of future policy decisions if Reddit is to remain the place that you and all of us want it to be It is absolutely not in the cards under any circumstances that those  would be shut down or quarantined right Until SRD and SRS is banned every one of these post is just bullshit PR used as justification for banning content the Admins dont like And im sure banning these subs has absolutely NOTHING to do with this huffington post blog that came out yesterday about contacting Reddits advertisers because of racist contenthttpsarchiveisEtkUN But your right its all about the subs actions and not the content It so fucking obvious to everyone here that Admins are banning things they dont like and thats it If they were actually following the PR bullshit they keep telling us then SRS and SRD would be gone I mean for fuck sake these people have a fucking custom CSS script that shows where people post and if its some where they dont like you get down voted because of it Stop trying to bullshit the people who made this place what it is I hate to defend it in any form but according to the spirit of this new policy update rcoontown should have been quarantined and subs like SRS should have been banned seeing as SRS targets specific redditors where as coontown is just a general racism forum Im sorry can you clarify how hentai and ficticious drawings is child porn unwelcome content  While Reddit generally provides a lot of leeway in what content is acceptable here are some guidelines for content that is not Please keep in mind the spirit in which these were written and know that looking for loopholes is a waste of time  Content is prohibited if it Is illegal Is involuntary pornography Encourages or incites violence Threatens harasses or bullies or encourages others to do so Is personal and confidential information Impersonates someone in a misleading or deceptive manner Is spam Does drawn pictures of underage fictitious characters really apply to the above Here is a definition of child porn that I found Child Pornography Child pornography is a form of child sexual exploitation Federal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor persons less than  years old Images of child pornography are also referred to as child sexual abuse images Source httpwwwjusticegovcriminalceoschildpornography Can you speak on how exactly minors or anybody is being exploited or hurt by the content in subs like rlolicons Can you own up to the fact that the subs you banned were not banned for breaking any of the new policys rules in fact the rules you updated in this new policy have been on the rules of subs like coontown for a while to avoid getting banned but because you believed they showed the negative side of reddit Clearly this is true because as hundreds have already pointed out subreddits that encourage brigading like SRS are still here And they actually broke the rules At least then people will realize you used your own morals to ban subs you didnt agree with which is pretty dumb on a website as huge as reddit Out of curiosity what constitutes the average redditor And if you dont have a working definition of that what steps will you be taking towards coming up with it Now Im really starting to worry that the reddit I love will die The subs youve banned Im sure are terrible but the amazing thing about reddit has always been the support of free speech I dont believe that you should ban ANY content thats legal Only behaviors like brigading and doxxing The two items that really bother me  Selective banning of embarrassing subs which leads many to believe and Im starting to think this that the admins are favoring certain ideologies  Requiring an email only for those subs deemed questionable WTF I was really hoping all this would blow over and wed be left with the old reddit but it seems clear now that the site is headed towards sanitized pablum or worse With the new push for transparency I would expect that the list of banned subreddits would be published I feel like there is a lot of talk about transparency and community involvement but not a lot of actual transparency and the community involvement seems more for posteritys sake Im going to play devils advocate for the loli subs that were banned For those who dont know loli is a sexual drawing of a minor which is completely legal in the US where the reddit HQ is located I personally dont view them but dont see too much of a problem with them existing either I understand it may have offended some people but if so why not add a quarantine label Looking though your content rules it says actual CP is banned but not drawing The reason these drawings are okay is the people depicted have no age You can draw a picture of a minor but say theyre  and thats where the legal grey area comes up To put it simply ITS FICTION Regarding you saying this will encourage sexual predator I think the opposite Would you rather have them look at real CP or fictional characters Youd want the latter of course It provides an outlet for people who are attracted to underaged people to express their views without causing real harm If this was actual CP you could say viewing it is harmful because it creates more demand and youd be absolutely right but demand for a fictional character with NO DEFINED AGE isnt hurting anyone Just my  cents on the matter You do realize you just told us you wouldnt ban rcoontownhttpsnpredditcomrannouncementscommentsdjjxwletstalkcontentamactrm right deleted This site gets worse by the week Why do I need to verify my email to visit quarantined subs Does this mean theres gonna be Geico ads on rSpacedicks  we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else This seems like a vague catch all rule that you can use to ban subreddits willy nilly Who decides what is making reddit worse for everyone else Why not quarantine the communities instead of banning them because then they will be closed off among themselves and will have no way of flouting those rules It seems like this rule is there to be applied anytime there is mounting political pressure on the company Any subreddit that is creating bad PR really This is reddits safety valve not a principle Irony here is that NOTHING has annoyed redditers as a whole more than the unprecedented level of censorship from the top imposed over the last few months Were not just talking fatpeoplehate either Who remembers the prochoice thread a month ago where they ordered every prolife comment to be deleted Disgusting how far you dun fell reddit We cant even have the most sophomoric of political discussions here yet spez claims reddit is the best place online to have truly authentic conversations The content guidelines refer to a harassment policyhttpsredditzendeskcomhcenusarticles which uses the words bully and then demean as a part of harassment Could we get some clarification on those terms For fucks sales I thought I was blessed when I found Reddit Loli community Ive spent far to much time on the darker parts of the web to find that stuff and far to often its thrown in with material that none of us a rlolicons or rpomf ever wanted the real disgusting vile shit it was safe here Had it been a quarantine I would have understood We get it out fetish is creepy as fuck But we were not hurting anyone I mean those were probably two of my favorite communities because we understood one another no one got harassed or attacked like on chan or chan were werent being flooded with referral links to actual CP by robot spammers it didnt feel like some dark alley where I had to do shady deals for a fix for once were safe and I didnt feel ashamed I didnt hate myself And you took it away because you dont like it Thats your only reason you clumped us together with a bunch of racist hate mongering assholes because you found our fetish morally objectionable And dont act like your doing some great deed by getting rid of it it still exists youve just forced us back to the places where were going to abused and harassed to find it youre helping no one your just hurting us me and my fellow lolis Youve left us to fend for ourselves against a horde of trolls Ill never leave reddit Ive invested to much but as a company Ive lost all faith in you your saving face not your community EDIT fixed auto correct mistake and added a sentence for clarification uspez are your promises actually workable I dont really see anyone talking about how Reddits chief engineer Bethanye Blount quit less than a month agohttprecodenetredditchiefengineerbethanyeblountquitsafterlessthantwomonthsonthejob Blount said she left because she did not think she could deliver on promises being made to the community I feel like there are going be some big bumps on the road ahead for Reddit Blount said Along the way there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community  in comments to mods quotes from board members  and theyre going to have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises Your content policy is so vague as to be meaningless make Reddit worse for everyone else How Is that its sole purpose Who gets to decide What is the reasoning process Its time to go after just all this shit I never know if what Im reading is what the community as its own entity has produced or if its been hacked away at by mods with communities banned etc to produce what the higherups personally believe is a more perfect website I dont want my experience here to be shaped by force by others moral persuasions or financial incentives Your use of the phrase everyone else is extremely troubling We are ALL everyone else All of us who dont get to control what is and isnt up on this website Goodbye Reddit Hello Voat Deleting this account and deleting my real account Just remember kids rsexwithdogs is ok but drawings arent deleted httpsvoatcovCoonTowncomments Not only that lets set up the raid posts now we dont have to worry about rcoontown getting banned any more time to start raiding their hugboxes This should be fun     ONE STEP CLOSER SOON ALL MODERATORS WILL BE LIZARDS AND WE WILL HAVE CONTROL its sad that the admin of the site cant even stick around and make more than a few posts on some of the most game changing stuff to their site fucking pitiful So when does SRS get banned for harassment deleted To be honest this is the first Ive ever heard of rCoonTown or anything related to it Im subscribed to subreddits that I am personally interested in Im unsubscribed from those that annoy me and anything with hurtful content has never crossed my radar I dont go out of my way to find people to be angry with Youre so full of shit uspez Just be honest that you want to turn Reddit into some shitty politically correct corporate advertising board If you actually gave a fuck about what annoys us as redditors you would ban the people who ACTUALLY brigade and doxx us rshitredditsays rsubredditdrama rcringe Sure rcoontown was a vile subreddit but they followed the rules They never left their sub to harass others By banning their sub you arent kicking them out youre letting them in Theyre going to spread their filth all over the rest of reddit now because their containment zone has been destroyed Great fucking job genius So Who is getting banned Nice try saying a handful of communities when what you meant to say was only rcoontownrelated subs to try and make it sound like you made some sweeping positive changes when you just banned one sub to appease your squad of yesmen  Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors You mean like that one that is brought up en masse by thousands of redditors every time this is discussed but will never be taken down due to admin favoritism Cool standards bro httpsvoatco deleted Then We arent deleting rcoontown because although the content on it is offensive it doesnt explicitly violate any rules specifically the content of rcoontown is Horrible actually but I dont think you can win an argument by simply silencing the opposition Now lol jk Translation Our new vague policies allow us to ban any subreddit or user for any reason at any time We didnt ban them because we disagree with them We banned them because this exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else HAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHA This was predicted to happen after Chairman Pao fell on her sword the New Boss would be hailed as the Savior and then swiftly take an axe to anything on reddit that might keep away advertising dollars Its about the money Its always about the money This is about monetizing the site which means a move to sanitization and less tolerance of any opinion not deemed safe What is accomplished by making quarantined communities only available to users with a registered email address Great marketing move Too bad people arent as thick as you think they are and cant be just fooled by repeating the phrase we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else ad infinitum Unfortunately it looks like SRS will continue to enjoy their harassment and downvote brigading Edit Come on guys I make a comment about downvote brigading and yall mass downvote uspez for actually responding when he didnt have to This is so bizarre you just made up a new rule and then banned subs without even giving them a chance to comply with it This is  Reddit literally any sub could be banned for violating a rule invented after the fact The average redditor Tell me more about how the front page of the internet can have an average user and how you came to decide what the criteria was for that Breaking Reddit or doing anything that interferes with normal use of Reddit Would you care to explain this Are you saying that the great blackout would have been prohibited under this rule Would mass subs going dark count as breaking Reddit If so why wound you ban the ONLY thing that got your prissy butts up and change policy we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else So whens SRS being banned You updated the content policy to make it very clear why a group gets banned Then you completely ignored it and banned a group for a reason you cannot point to in the new content policy Ive never been to rCoonTown I dont like rCoonTown but this isnt really acceptable People have been asking for clear rules and youve demonstrated that youre not able to provide them If they were doing offsite or message harassment just say so and Id be happy Id think that was an acceptable reason Please also ban rAMA political propaganda and advertisement is hardly authentic and makes Reddit worse for me Thanks Really upsetting Been on this site  years on many different accounts but this smells like F to me ggwp Thanks for the ggod times and the bad We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor Really You spent all that time rewriting the policy and just end up with a vague declaration that you can interpret however you feel like Who gets to decide what an average redditor is You Your mom The guy sitting in the desk next to you Actual studies and polls of redditors Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors Whatever that means Given that the ONLY subreddits that fall under this category so far are the coontown variants it also seems like you just interpret this one as banning whatever stuff you feel like using its whats say it is rather than any actual rules Whats the point of rewriting a policy if it all ends up being as vague as shit and subject to the interpretation of whatever the hell I feel like cause Im the boss Exist solely to annoy other redditors does anyone honestly buy this bullshit reason How did you come to that conclusion anyway uspez Maybe providing real data about reddits ins and outs with regards to communities and the traffic they generate as well as the violations they do and the brigading that they create could help us understand more why you think  are creating problems for the    update I know some of you are upset because we banned anything today but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities which prevents us from working on things for the other  literally of Reddit rCoonTown was just the lowest hanging fruit Youll still be spending a disproportionate amount of time itll just be with the next most controversial subs The same reason was used to ban jailbait then involuntary pornography and then harassing subs deleted So what about rcrackertown You guys really suck at this Yeah what about this craphttpsnpredditcomrShitRedditSayscommentsnwjhmetasubmittingnplinkstosrsisnowbanned Thats ACTIVELY TRYING TO MANIPULATE AND BRIGADE THREADSHoly shit how more blatant can a subreddit be Ban SRS already Why havent you banned SRS yet They are the WORST offenders of breaking the rules you have set up but you refuse to ban that subreddit Why Why do you continue to let SRS harrass people Why do you continue to let SRS doxx people Why do you continue to let SRS vote brigade What makes SRS any different from Coontown Or fatpeoplehate Or Watchniggersdie Is it a racial thing Are you only banning racists Do you not give a shit about anything else What is going on You keep on talking about being open with what youre doing but you dont tell us anything about what we want to know What is even the point Why are you even talking right now Just letting us simmer in the absent silence is basically the same as what youre having us do right now I believe this policies strike the right balance Also some people are exempt from them Apparently deleted Why is slimgur banned from reddit  As a Russian on the Internet I feel really offended by the existence of rRussiansOnTheInternet Can we ban it as well How bought you just stop updating policy Reddit was just fine before you started messing with it Guess what If I dont feel like being offended I dont go to places that offend me Yay another Front Page Shitfest I do not need you to be my parent Reddit and neither does anyone else on this site I am perfectly well capable of removing offending things from my eyes and not going back to them You know like an ADULT Im done thank god I was made aware of voat putting subs in quarantine and banning others is exactly what I was hoping would not happen Ive been lied to Welcome to the new reddit lads where censorship rules the day How soon we forget Do you plan to ban the Fempire as well uspez communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors  sounds like the mission statement of rshitredditsays to me rcoontown dindu nuffin rkillwhitey is still okay though I think you just banned all these subs for commercial reasons Also banning communities because having them around is inconvenient isnt really cool either deleted What a joke we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors Wow so its back to kindergarten rules is it Is there a forummessage board somewhere for adults who can handle intentionally going to a sub that they know might annoy them How is voat handling their bandwidth problems these days So as before you are banning communities for the sole reason that  you dont agree with them or  they threaten your advertising revenue because they simply exist And once again the reason given for the banning is because they exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Under that logic why is SRS still not banned They harass dox brigade comb the histories of users they dont like solely to downvote ancient comments and do nothing but talk about how much they hate Reddit yet they still use it And just recently a couple of SRS users THREATENED A WOMAN WITH RAPEhttpswwwredditcomrSRSsuckscommentsfcqgupdateimthegirlwhoreceivedrapethreats because she had the temerity to say something they didnt like When this was brought to the attention of the SRS mods they banned HER for reporting abusive messages and rape threats This is the EXACT type of behavior that you supposedly banned FPH and other subs for So I ask again WHY DOES SRS GET A FREE PASS You have been given numerous and REPEATED examples of SRS violating the VERY SAME RULES you use to censor other communities yet you do NOTHING to SRS SRS is consistently voted the most toxic communityhttpidiboncomtoxicityinredditcommunitiesajourneytothedarkestdepthsoftheinterwebs on the entire site They add nothing of value and they actively seek to make everyones experience worse And still you do nothing In doing nothing you are complicit in their behavior Your platitudes of banning behavior not ideas is rendered bunk You are actively seeking to silence not those who break rules but those who hurt your feelings Instead of banning them for the same reasons you supposedly banned other subs you merely develop tools to keep them from doing anything mean What dirt do they have on you uspez Ban SRS stop lying to the users about your motives and grow a goddamn spine Or soon enough they will turn on you as well and you will have nobody left to sympathize with you Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past The update to the policy we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Seems like a pretty dramatic change to me as it is effectively a whatever sticks clause to justify banning any sub you find undesirable When are you going to update the values page to erase all this free speech business that you seem to no longer care about  Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else I dont understand Why bother making this new tool quarantines if youre still going to ban subreddits Do you not trust the effectiveness of this tool Also is there a list of the subreddits being banned I thought you were going to provide a link with why a subreddit was banned rcoontown despite being reviled amongst some users didnt appear to violate any of the rules It also did well to enforce additional rules that places like SRS flaunt Why was rcoontown banned specifically We didnt ban them because we disagree with them We banned them because this exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Holy loophole Batman deleted Still murky as all hell TL DR Subs we like will stay SRS subs we dont like will go FPH variants coontown I can tolerate banning of subreddits since its your website and whatnot but dont try to say you support free speech without an asterisk the size of Hillary Duffs asshole that says only if its PC We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor And how are you going to determine what is extremely offensive to the average redditor rWTF or rSexWithDogs could easily qualify and they are still here who decides what is offensive The way you guys are managing redditcom is absolutely fucking hilarious Reddit is for truly authentic conversations except for the fact unpopular opinions get downvoted and what we dont agree with is banned Prohibited behavior Asking for votes or engaging in vote manipulation Phew Since we all know vote bridgading is a form of manipulation SRS and Bestof are going to get banned if they continue to brigade or in other words existyou know now that this new content policy update clearly mentions no vote manipulation Glad we got this cleared up Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is I think its pretty clear that SRS is a cancer on the community and needs to go It ABSOLUTELY prevents many people from being able to enjoy Reddit The brigade of downvotes they bring makes people afraid to say what they want Every day you allow that sub to exist youre showing how hypocritical you are That you are making arbitrary decisions on what subs get banned based on nothing more than your personal preference Quarantining is a good step from outright banning But banning more subreddits in addition to that isnt going to solve anything Banning subreddits that break the TOS like harassing users and such makes sense but you cant go and ban subreddits that dont no matter how much people dont like them rfatpeoplehate for example was annoying to people but could easily be ignored It didnt need to be banned initially But I totally understand that it was banned for the brigading it did I was subscribed to one of the subreddits that was being brigaded and its users harassed rcoontown for example is easily ignored and doesnt deserve to be banned even if they are racist as shit I hear rumors about brigading but I personally dont know enough about it If there is evidence that they are doing something like that then by all means ban them But just because you dont agree with them doesnt mean they should be banned You essentially run the site and can do whatever you want But remember what the users want deleted  we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Yeah you fucking sellout cocksucker rShitredditsays their troll communities aimed at harassing and doxxing users rSubredditdrama constantly harassing and brigading smaller subs and tons and tons of radfem communities which are meant JUST TO ANNOY AND HARASS other users Only difference your tongues up their butt Stop fucking sugar coating your words you selfrighteous asshole Reddit isnt doing this to protect the users theyre doing this to protect the advertisers so they feel more comfortable being associated with a website like this Its pretty simple Why explain to your advertiser who doesnt understand Reddit But those subreddits you choose to enter Its not all bad and give a huge explanation Wouldnt you rather just say Reddit is a great place and not have to worry about bad subreddits I hate the term slippery slope but soon more subs will be brought down Whats the deal with SRS Quarantine at the very least correct What happened to my little message board run by the people rabuseporn rstrugglefucking are still around lol Lol  how bad this place is getting uspez is a patsy sent here to finish what uekjp started The only way for any of us to show how serious we are is to stop providing content and stop gilding Otherwise keep using the site and dont complain does this mean that SRS is finally banned and when is SRS banned Hey how about you grow a pair and ban rshitredditsays too Reddit badly needs a compliance department If it already has one it needs to get rid of its compliance department I wish rTIL could be quarantined off the front page Given that coontown was banned what about its opposite crackertown Or SRS Surely the mods would address all these hateful subs otherwise it would be clear that there is a political agenda being pushed How is it the best place online to have truly authentic conversations if you get to pick and choose what gets shownsaid we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Sounds like you missed a certain community Your definition of spam is very very very unorthodox and seems to mostly discriminate against regular thoughtful interesting people who simply arent popular SPAM traditionally is simply advertisements for things for sale for money and nothing more What will be considered extremely offensive So were now just fucking tumblr No hurty peoples feefees or we ban your already quarantined subreddit Great Fuck reddit  handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else IMO this describes the drama subreddits Heres a quick list for you to check out rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays rshitredditsays we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors That is literally SRS and its a sub you refuse to even consider banning There it is reddit has started banning offensive subreddits How did they do it They decided to devalue the subreddit to nothing more than trolls Remember how they said they werent going to ban rcoontown like  weeks ago Well they waited for you to become complacent before taking their next step Little by little they will warp this site to their new vision In a year from now reddit will be nothing more than an echo chambercircle jerk where corporate interests control what we see There will still be cat pictures though Subs like rcoontown are banned in fact you banned only coontown related subs but SRS is still up and running While I didnt agree with their ideology or what they represented you uspez stated yourself on several occasions you did not support the beliefs of rcoontown but believed they had a place here on reddit SRS clearly violates reddits Content Policy yet remains unaffected whereas the former did not and were contained to their own communities Its the same shit as before just packaged with a ribbon Very disappointing Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past One new concept is Quarantining a community which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor Can you provide a list of Quarantined subreddits This is the equivalent of creating a black hole to throw out the trash It may start with removing the bad stuff but soon it destroys everything Its ok rcrackertown is still good Top cuck TIL reddit becomes a politically correct corporate shill Time to find another site BE CONSISTENT HOW HARD IS THIS TO COMPREHEND So which subs got banned Am I on Tumblr now Where does does rcrackertown fit into the new spirit rules This is pathetic Wingapo Mod of rIndianCountry here Brief Context  users rIndianCountry is the secondlargest general Native American subreddit We also scored some positive diversity publicity for Reddit in an Indian Country Today Media Network story httpindiancountrytodaymedianetworkcomcloudcommuningdirectestoniaapacheteensdigitalpowwowpodcastpageC this March ICTMN is basically the New York Times equivalent for Indian Country  Native Americans   Simple Question Is this policy update going to affect the nonban nonQuarantine status of rRedskins given the teams name controversy and court determinations that its a racial slur Thanks for your dedication to quality respect and civility Im not into lolicon but what the fuck did they do to deserve it Glad reddit is removing porn on the standard of I personally find this gross  adult comms hosted here should be very scared and looking at moving  update Im off for now thanks for your feedback RIP my inbox Love the new guy so far Sprinkle a little SJW logic over hereban a little free speech over there then run and hide when confronted by the community Did you not create reddit for us the users to enjoy I dont get why reddit is continuing to do one of the most unpopular thing it has ever done The vast majority of the people here disagree with the censorship thats going on here The core of this website is for the users to decide what the best content is and for the users to discuss that content Why not take that same approach to the rules of the websitewithin reason Its worked very well thus far deleted ShitRedditSays is by far the worst sub How is it still not banned Finally reddit is going the way of Digg rcoontown followed the rules so well that reddit had to change their content policy in order to ban it The only thing worse than the awful censorship policy being enacted here is how obviously dishonest uspez is being about it I would even put up with some bullshit like this if you guys just came out and said CT and FPH and Loli are content we dont like and dont want to see on the site so we banned it Reddit is a private outfit and doesnt have to guarantee first amendment rights to anyone But to fuckin parade around here saying these communities make reddit worse for everyone and make it hard for us to improve the site and exist just to torture others and then full blown ignore all the thousands of questions about Kiketown and Sexwithdogs and SRS its offensive on the face of it and an insult to our intelligence as a community as a whole Just say what you fuckin mean You are censoring content you find objectionable Stop being so political about it ALMOST EVERYONE sees it for exactly what it is and still you spin your nonsense and hock your bullshit like anyone is buying it Enough I held on for long enough But to both censor content and lie about why youre censoring content is spineless on top of being disrespectful and useless I held on for as long as I could and I am really really going to miss rmistyfront But I cant support this nonsense with my pageviews and clicks anymore One new concept is Quarantining a community which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in So how does one optout of this restriction In other words how do I optin to all such communities at once current and future Its ridiculous how you are constantly dodging the question of the list of the quarantined subreddits It proves how little the feedback matters we asked for more transparency and a list of banned subreddits isnt released I have no idea why you arent releasing it because if there is something there to hide Im sure it will eventually come out It is very apparent from this new policy that if enough butthurt redditors publicly or secretly declare a subreddit vaguely violating these rules that subreddit has the ability to get banned So rCrackerTown is ok Its not even quarantined deleted Ok As soon as voat opens user registrations Im leaving Hey spez I know this comment is a bit late but is there any chance you could tell us why reddit has been removing hundreds of posts about the TPP many with thousands of upvotes that arent breaking any rules Why not just say We are banning  quarantining subreddits that negatively impact Reddits image Nobody believes any other explanation By asking them to believe your mirror trick to try and apply a content policy to some subs and not others both of whom break the same policy as many have said already it looks sleezy It looks sly It looks exactly like the actions of every other big site You just lost your USP However distateful you I or the majority find it these distasteful subs absolutely MUST exist for as long as they represent peoples true opinions It really does not matter how much work that creates for you  that is your problem not your customers Deal with it I dont know about you but I really really like to know who the bigots the small minded and the ignorant are Maybe not in real life yes even they deserve the anonymity that everyone enjoyswell trys to MINSA etc but at least how they represent themselves on this site Please go back to where you started  being open and honest Allow ANYTHING legal Let your community decide what goes up and what goes down after all isnt that the entire point of this site EDITS  Me no typey much here Today in addition to applying Quarantines we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors prevent us from improving Reddit and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else Glad to see ragainstmensrights and rgamerghazi are still going strong Why dont you just ban SRS Seriously why do you keep defending them Half of this thread is saying your word is usless due to your blatant hypocrisy and they are not wrong I dont understand why you dont just follow suit they clearly break the rules youve just laid out but yet youd rather annoy your users and provide shelter for a bastion of hate then do what is not only expected but morally correct we are banning a handful of communities that  generally make Reddit worse for everyone else This is utter bullshit uSpez and you know it I never ever go to rCoonTown so their activity doesnt make Reddit worse for me I sub to the subs I want to No one is forcing me to look at those subs Looks like Pao was replace with another puppet to carry out this censorship crusade This is a sad day for Reddit What about shadow banning Still no definition on brigading thats some pretty shitty content policy Wow Writing that formal Content Policy must have taken minutes Literally minutes Quarantines Like Apartheid right Were going to do what you wanted us to do and simply quarantine controversial subs because of how badly we were reamed by the community over banning subs and flipflopping our position on free speech versus playing on the slippery slope of what lawful content to allow or prohibitoh by the way here is a list of controversial subs we just banned Welcome to the new reddit comrades Will there be a way to view a full list of all Quarantined subreddits for transparency The first new beta feature will be a dedicated spoiler button right guys Instead of using CSS tricks on the NSFW button Been here  years and am still waiting ahhhhhh I got so excited I thought rredditcom was being brought back How early do you guys really intend to use this Is rbeta going to be more of a soft launch for more experimental programs or are you going to use it for all kinds front end development How do you run your programsprojects anyway Ive always wondered It seems like every project has a different approach and I worry that rbeta is going to be used too inconsistently to make it worthwhile this ought to be fun for RES  is there a way we can detect that the current user is a beta user so that we can report it in tech support requests for example could you add a body class of betauser or some such I wonder what its like working at Reddit Meeting Hey guys everyone get seated Today were going to brainstorm about new features for the site We need to engage users and make sure they have plenty of input into the website What about a BETA program We used to have it and people liked it What about fixing the search capabilities Excuse mewhats your name Me Chris Chrisget the fuck out Anyone else want to bring up search What about site stability I got the site down page a few times last week and wasnt able to comment for a while DOES ANYONE WANT TO MAKE COOL THINGS OR TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS TODAY FUCK  End of meeting Will we be beta testing blog posts So what features are actually in beta Reddit is full of betas Translated We know that we royally fucked up with the last blog post about our core values which is no longer even listed on rblog nevermind see below comments So were dusting off a  year old cosmetic changes program and letting people beta test it We hope this will help distract you from the glaring issues of our mismanagement Are you going to bring back the ability to see how many votes there are At least on comments Nobody is going to forget the disastrous core values post reddit admins Here are some issues  Mobile doesnt stay logged in  When browsing mobile if someone has a picture as their submission it shows the whole picture and takes up your whole screen as a preview  this is particularly irritating  loading is waaaay longer if it loads at all bring back the updown counters deleted Bring back the ability to see votes  means a lot more than  bring back the vote counters I found a copy of the product backlog which will make up the next few iterations of reddit beta  Automatic playing of Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn videos using the power of HTML  JavaScript which uses machine learning to automatically ban anyone who posts anything about Chairman Pao  Special serverside support for suing your previous employers for bullshit gender discrimination claims for amounts of money that just happen to be the amount your husband is in the red lucky  A special SAFE SPACE button which puts a new div over the entire content area of the site and replaces all site content with a picture of a unicorn hugging Snoo Im sure theres more but Im too busy oppressing otherkin women and PoCs right now to finish the whole list Can we get numbers of upvotes and downvotes back I thought we were beta testing already  This will automatically subscribe you to rbeta Man TRP is gonna be piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissed I thought this was reserved for those users who have Gold Why dont you focus on making the existing site better instead of adding features we dont need I wrote a little guide if you are interested in reporting issues you find in the beta httpswwwredditcomrbetacommentsbfeedbackwanttobethebestbetatesterthereis Can you guys bring back upvote and downvote totals I would beta test for that in fact I already did when I first signed up It worked great please bring it back Some cool new features are being added but nothing as revolutionary as a new search engine for reddit So betaredditcomhttpsbetaredditcom and rbeta both exist and theyre different Weird usually the subdomain redirects to the subreddit of the same name Can you optin and out at will Where do I sign up for the reddit ALPHA program I get to be someone important now Take that Dad Can I opt out of the mobile beta Having to delete the m and type www every time I connect to reddit from google on my phone is annoying as shit guys fix the mobile website first it often asked me to sign in more than once I would be writing a long comment and then hit send and it would bring up the message to allow the reddit mobile app or whatever Losing my comment when I hit okay Ill beta test if you guys are bring back the downvote data Until then fuck you reddit Damn it I thought this meant rredditcom was coming back My mobile browser went into the new beta mode and quite frankly I hate it How do I go back to the original mobile version Is this part of the Gold refund program from the rthefappening Did we forget about that little issue too Havent you already been using this to debut the qa sort and other features Since youre using python is there a python framework for managing all the different switchesexperiments when AB testing features  Airbnb has something called terbuchet which launches features at users and you can do things like expose this feature to  of users I was wondering if there was something similar for django or maybe something more generic how are you guys building it  Will this get us a trophy Does this mean youll stop deploying betas to production urls I almost stopped visiting whenyou broke mredditcom Oh yeah it starts with betas Pretty soon we have  in dayone reddit DLC and an earlyaccess reddit Im on to you Admins always post their shit on the front page Some of just dont care Damn the admins have time to advertise all kinds of things but never find the time to answer my messages Fuck this Cool I like trying new things How will this work with RES and Mobile users Could someone eli for the benefit of this I also really hoped this was for redditcom Can we beta test your mission statement How do I get rid of reddit beta on my mobile phone I fucking hate it deleted Hi I work for  industries whats beta Well thanks for making go to my preferences for the first time Never realized I could view more than  links on a page and Ive been here for over  years whats the deal with the servers how are you going to fix the servers issues Optedin D Lets go bug hunting Hey nobody seemed to have asked this so out of curiosity if I use RES and want to continue to do so should I bother opting in Is there anything additional that should be considered when giving feedback Thanks Will this be a safer beta I thought that was the purpose of gold and one of the reasons to buy gold for yourself When will we get crossposting management What if the article is a recipe for beef yogurt I couldnt in good conscience mark that as kosher Im going to redditca to avoid the draft I will help you so long as I get discounted viagra as promised Downvoted clearly spam You can count on me Finally a draft I dont have to dodge I am a x Can I mark all Y as spam where x   y     rebublicandemocrat democratrepublican homophobehomosexual dogcat MartianVenitian Promartian venitianconfused Venusian MRA antiMRA Feministantifeminist Holy crap they make Viagra watches now And I can get a discount Oh hell yeah sign me up How will you stop spammers setting up shill accounts to label their spam as not spam I suggest only accounts older than  months can label spam From the size of your staff crowdsourcing is the way to go Change I can believe in Just dont tell me I have to cut my hair Awesome When do I get my gun Well probably enable users for this in order of seniority Or maybe descending karma Is there a way we can see this list of users sorted by descending karma Even if its just the top  or so Im karmacurious We just got voluntold Fuck you I wont do what you tell me Since this is an emergency all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated It is every robots duty to give his life for the good of humanity Aw crap I am deeply disturbed by the admins use of New Zealish Clearly they are just American and cant understand that the only way to refer to people from New Zealand is New Zealanders or kiwis P deleted ha so when are you guys going to roll out metamoderation then  Not sure if you are aware but another counter measure slashdot uses is to check if the person is using an anonymous proxy Basically if the system thinks you might be a spammer it will request oktxthttpslashdotorgoktxt from its own site using the IP address of the submitter as a proxy If it gets the file then the submitter is using an anonymous proxy and is blocked Sees picture of Viagra Pills Sees post indicating I am being drafted Sees Admin red lettering Doesnt see NSFW warning Clicks on link to see if an erection will be mandatory to read reddit in the future Awesome Really innovative solution to a unbelievably pervasive problem Thanks Reddit admins I WANTS ME A BADGE So Reddits moderation system is slowly turning in to slashdots huh Not that its necessarily a bad thing Please dont use the word Kosher for notspam It doesnt have a clear meaning that it is safe many of us dont live among large or active jewish populations so the term sounds very strange Please just say nospam clear or worthy I know it is not even a reality that filter but I am just voicing my opinion before it goes live What if a topic is clearly posted in the wrong subreddit It would then be classified as offtopic Is it a good idea to report this as offtopicspam or should I just downvote Will we see this if we have compress the link display enabled This seems like a extremely well thought out solution Thank you for not only keeping reddit spam free but giving us the power to solve our own problems  and has been in our dreams since forever reddit admins have weird dreams Speaking of dreams I had a weird one last night where I was driving my car from the backseat It was very scary as I couldnt see the road very well Im glad someone else is having weird dreams too Im sorry New Zealish Id never realized how difficult it is to fit our countrys name into a sentence like that deleted How about a different word than kosher That word is veryuhJewish Let the downvotes commence I like how the thumbnail for this post is a bunch of Viagra Yeah my watch says its almost erectionthirty Were going to deploy this change very slowly and carefully since it could kill the site in about seventythree different complex ways Think of it as the Large Hadron Collider of the internet One small calculation error could open a black hole The term is voluntold Service guarantees citizenship Anything but kosher unless this is some meat market With as much fucking time as I spend on Reddit Im in Id feel somewhat better about my slacking As a mod when I view the spam filter link on my subreddit will the spam include some sort of an indication as to what percentage of people have voted something as actually spam Or will the submitted link simply leave the spam filter once enough people say that its not spam Will the mod have the power to overrule a decision and still mark a certain link as spam AH HA Finally a use for Karma other than bragging rights COuld reddit give me their opinion about subreddits that exist for the sole purpose of publishing every article posted by some domains I mean site fakenewsandviagracom creating a rfakenewsandviagra for linking to all articles from that site I submit regularly to rreportthespammershttpwwwredditcomuserrolmossubmitted but dont know whether to report sites like those a few celebrity news sites come to mind Also can reddit ban entire domains from ever being linked to if a site uses the common technique of creating one account per article for a spammy site constantly I see this more and more often I know a competitor of a site could publish articles from the legit site in a spammy way to try to get them banned but maybe IP banning could help EDIT Also should I consider submitters like these spammers nsfwhttpwwwredditcomuseranoniguy This guy is only linking to a specific site probably his and only writes small comments for THOSE submissions No community participation either Im confused about this solution as it gives spammers more incentive to spam If I keep posting spam articles from my hundreds of accounts eventually one of them will hit prime placement at the top of the page where someone will look at it How is this different than creating a banner ad placement at the top of the page and letting anyone post a text ad for free Can we have a way to mark multiple posts about daily events that are just not needed The New channel gets downright useless the day any celebrity gets arrestedmarrieddiesetc surely the system should start throwing out all the power users who have thousands of submission karma and very little comment karma At first glance they look like useful redditors but surely the only reason anyone would submit more than they comment is because theyve got a vested interest in the submissions Anyone who has far greater submission karma than comment karma isnt really an active member of the community it probably means theyre SEOs Also anyone who has more than  of their posts from threads they submitted should be given a stern looking at I had to stop subscribing to report the spammers after a while spotting them wasnt tricky but too many of the same offenders kept on cropping up being reported and never being deleted This is a good idea in principle but What happens when someone posts a link to a scholarly research article on the physics of how an airplane really can cause a pancaking collapse of a large building but all the  conspiracy theorists out there start marking it as spam What about when someone posts a link to a procircumcision article and the anticirc crowd starts marking it as spam Theres enough people who use the down vote to say I dont like what you have to say How do we prevent this from being used in the same manner For an atheist website why use the term Kosher I think it should be a bit more neutral Please change the button so that it does not read Kosher Thank you Kosher is a neathttpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermkosher choice of words I approve of thishttpenwikipediaorgwikiKosherciterefPartridge However in the interest of interfaith relations I suggest that during the month of RamadanhttpenwikipediaorgwikiRamadan the buttons be labelled haraamhttpenwikipediaorgwikiEBAarCm and halalhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHalal respectively Im curious How does one define spam Kosher Cant it just be OK Do I have to be a rabbi to mark things as kosher I will fight spam till I die I am all yours So are we pretty much the Reddit militia now But what if we start a revolution What will you do than Who will police the police I see how reddit works now Conscription Forcing the everyday man to do the dirty work Pink instead of blue or orangered What I really hope there is some sort of override for moderators  Then traffic grew so much that the spam filters tiny false positive rate started accumulating into a constant stream of stories about poor souls who were unfairly blocked Tiny I guess Im an outlier then Im moving to Canada Me Drafted fuck it Im moving to Canada I dont see why you dont start using captchas for new submissions If I might suggest a simple measure to stop complaining about the spamfilter Reset submissions when you take them out of the spamfilter Currently the damage done by a false positive is unrepairable but if you simply pretend it is submitted the moment it is released from the spamfilter so it shows up in the new queue no harm is done edit When I think about how easy this idea is I cant be the only one who thought it up So then my question becomes why did you decide against implementing it ARE WE HELPING TRAIN SOME SORT OF NEURAL NET OR BAYESIAN NETWORK if so then cool D Is there any chance of drafting only established redditors  say those of more than  months active membership WTF Kosher  have the damn retards taken over reddit I smell possible abuse to get good threads deleted p Cheating New Zealic Is that really an adjective I can use to describe myself Time to run to canada then I will gladly serve Oh Captain My Captain Yay Were all Saydrahs This looks great How about a block user button Can we please NOT call it Kosher Srsly this may work like the downvote thing works on reddit people will start calling the things they dont like spam so do you have a plan for this raldi I am not liking the kosher button Please change to notspam or approved for redditing As an atheist reddit should be as secular as possible reporting in So is the automated filter dead or at least severely reined in Sweet this is a great move Id love to see it expanded to include duplicate submissions too Thank you Well shit I have to do work now I come on Reddit in order to NOT do work there shall be no mixing of milk and meat deleted Can I include this in my weekly PPP Last week Assisted in the eradication of  spam items on a popular social networking platform This is a miraculous idea You guys come up with some pretty decent stuff over there This leads me to believe you actually work and dont just play games all day like I have imagined I like this using the users that prove themselves worthy enough to help moderate the site Im looking forward to more updates about this new feature I had a dream about something like this Weird Dejavu Can I get off if Im gay or shot off my pinky or Im just generally against erm blocking spam One thing maybe make the headline of the spam less prominent Who knows what my coworkers will think Im browsing How often will we be seing these Will there be a way to if I was in a good mood request to see a pink box on every page Im assuming there would be a minimum frequency wed see them Will we have to enable the show me new links on the front page option in preferences in order to see this function once it is live Is this anything like when you guys made me an admin for a day sweet Great Though I wonder what will prevent spammers from using the moderation system to mark their own stuff as not spam using several accounts on different IPs OK I read elsewhere in this thread that you wont discuss countermeasures which makes sense Im sure youve thought of this in any case  Or maybe descending karma wait  karma has meaning Hands up if you had to visit sexdepartmentcom after reading the example Am I special or has everyone been drafted here Thanks for volunteering being volunteered When I was in Venturers senior boy scouts they used to say youve been voluntold link karma or comment karma The biggest issue I can see is if a subset of reddit users decide they dont like a particular submission and decide to suppress it by collectively marking it as spam The countermeasure to this would be to set a high threshold at which a submission is considered spam However this threshold number would have to vary from subreddit to subreddit depending upon the number of active members reported Sounds good to me Id be happy to judge the occasional alleged spam link I wonder just how high my karma is now in comparison to others though You all deserve a medal I knew thered be a draft under obama Mitch Hedberg would say this I find that Monty Pythons opinion of me is very much influenced by whether or not I like spamalot SIR YES SIR this concept can be used as a serach engine too D This is a really decent idea awesome cant wait to see how this plays out I think the thumbnail relates We are all insignificant rocks in a river of spam We must work together to prevent the spam from wearing us down into smooth versions of our former jagged unique selves Oh and a updown tally of over  Impressive Instead of going through all this what if you just asked the people doing the spam to stop How did this blogspam get to the top of the front page I cant downvote this enough Wheres the offtopicspam button This has NOTHING to do with the iPad or collateral murder War were declared Oh Captain my Captain its so funny that we call spam spam dont you think An interesting solution to the problem of not having any employees who can build a proper spam filter Everyone calm down Im a deputy While youve got the hood open allow us to add NSFW tags as well OffTopicSpamHamSafeHamNSFW So this will put up posts that people claimed was unfairly removed and give us a chance to save them If youre just putting up a random sampling of spam its like free advertising space for random spammers This smells of socialism Slashdot Very well then ME GUSTA Im doing my part Anyone care to guess how long it will take for the downvote bots to start marking everything Kosher So what are you going to do about a large group of people purposely miscatagorizing legitimate posts as spam The more you include the community the better it gets Nice move guys Sweet Ive always wanted a discount Viagra watch Give me a shotgun a keg of beer a car with half a tank of fuel a pack of cigarette and a list of IPs Ill solve your spam problem James Cole report for volunteer duty steps up Ready to serve my community I bet people begin bragging when this starts popping up on their pages based on the way the blog was worded Bunch of narcs lets see if reddit follows slashdots path next added will be metamoderation At least you are trying to solve the problem I think we are up to the task Its just been revokedhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvdrnDfUwQW Love it whats a viagra watch to keep track of how long your erection will last I just repliedhttpwwwredditcomrDoesAnybodyElsecommentsdyldaereallynotgiveashittaboutwhatsgoingoncyvuhcontext to a new user with some helpful info then saw this thread Hopefully some others find it helpful too Actually a lot of us redditors were originally diggers I started checking reddit in addition to digg maybe  and a half years back and eventually just stopped going to digg Its not that I suddenly decided one group of people were substantially dumber but rather that the potential for learning existed more here at reddit It wasnt all ice cream and posies either though After lurking for a while I registered an account so I could leave a poorly executed ad hominem comment I got downmodded to oblivion and I took it personally it hurt  Why dont these guys want to hear what I have to say I deleted the comment and continued to think about it I didnt actually have anything to add to the conversation As such the rest of the redditors were filtering out useless posts using their individual moderation powers as is encouraged by the reddiquettehttpwwwredditcomhelpreddiquette Other things Ive learned here  Correct usage of grammar punctuation spelling etc serves the primary purpose of avoiding invalidation of your message due to others perceiving you as being dumb Yes the function of written language is to get a message across and it can still get across if you spell things incorrectly or your sentences are phrased strangely but there are always corollary messages conveyed simultaneously An example would be the mistakes connotation i rite liek a idiot so take wut i say wit a grain of salt  Dont plagiarize If you appreciate something chances are others will too Honor it by crediting the source and it may even pay off by means of residual effects  increased traffic to a site thereby increasing ad impressions and revenue for example Also people here are from all backgrounds and many many levels of knowledge of many many subjects Theres also a good chance someone else will have seen whatever youre passing off as your own and they will call you out on it  In general just care Think before you write or post something This site and community are only as good as you make it That also being said make sure you adjust your subreddit subscriptionshttpwwwredditcomreddits to accommodate your personal interests A few highly recommended subreddits to get the most out the site are True reddithttpwwwredditcomrtruereddit tldrhttpwwwredditcomrtldr and best ofhttpwwwredditcomrbestof  Also be openminded Dont discount any particular political stances simply because of which side endorses them judge what you see and hear for what they are and if it is ludicrous blast it to hell but only do so after understanding it or trying to hardest to do so  Karma is worthless Dont worry about it Really Its not actually a measurement of your epenis or how much people like you and what you have to say etc Speak your mind if you have something pertinent to say or if want to show the rest of us something do it however best facilitates doing so For example dont post an image of text if the text is readily available It probably takes longer to load the image could be in a lossy format and be of an unreadable quality etc This is called karmawhoring it is looked upon with disapproval The Karma system is inherently plagued by certain circumstances like that those comments which have existed longer will generally be upvoted more and that a hivemind develops based on similar opinions so people will occasionally circle jerk by simply feeding this hivemind An example here would be hating on Nickelback  I dont think their particular music is any worse than a lot of the other stuff out there I wouldnt not watch porn because there was a track by them in the backgroundhttpwwwredditcomrvideoscommentsdyjloonsfwcywftcontext but the hivemind will do what it does  If you do want to accumulate more karma for whatever reason browse posts sorted by whats newhttpwwwredditcomnew andor see what is being posted outside your subreddit subscriptions by viewing all postshttpwwwredditcomrall Help the community by downvoting and if you really want reportinghttpwwwredditcomrreportthespammers the spammers upvote the decent material or that you think should gain more exposure and comment early on threads that have the potential to be popular To get the most out of everything you see here though dont forget to change how comments are sorted  by best new top etc to vary whats within reasonable scrolling distance One last thing heres another useful link  markdown guidehttpwwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsewgtredditmarkdownprimerorhowdoyoudoallthat If you have any other questions just ask somebody will probably be willing to help you out Oh

FAQshelpfaqs The ads on reddit are a lot less annoying than they are on most other sites And sometimes instead of an ad you get a game or a picture of a pretty girl If you use Firefox and AdBlock and youd like to make us an exception for a while to see for yourself instructions are herehelpadblock And if someone wants to write up instructions for browsers other than Firefox wed love to have them Here at reddit we like to complain We complain about republicans we complain about democrats we complain about how useless and pathetic we are as individuals we complain about all the people complaining all the time and we most certainly complain about rcirclejerk We like to fantasize and we like to tell each other how cool and funny we are And to be honest as long as we think we are cool and funny whos to say we arent But reddit can be serious Reddit is full of people who would quickly and happily extend a helping hand You have a question raskreddit will do their best to come up with an answer You need advice Steer clear of rshittyadvice Or go there Your call Reddit is full of people with feelings a sense of humor desires pride We have helped people with their small businesses we have helped people find solutions to homelessness I have seen more comments about people spraying their keyboards with coffee than any other single type of comment Reddit has moods reddit can be happy reddit can be sad Remember reddit is a bunch of individuals In a site like this the loudest minority is often the most heard until the masses get fed up with a particular type of annoyance and rear their mighty selfpost selfrighteousness Ultimately there are no absolutes here We try our best to be respectful and considerate but we are only human and we sometimes fail This is a friendly place though This is a community and we all try to contribute not to exploit We like eachother were friends Not good enough friends that we add everyone to our friends tab but buddies or something like that So have a good time Dont be afraid to post comment submit So the hivemind doesnt like your news article So what Move on So some eloquent speaker disagrees with your opinion Thank himher for sharing hishers and move on We make a big deal about Karma noone actually cares Granted there is a time and a place for every topic of conversation but its not hard to find that place and the time is early

best thing about Reddit  Reddiquettehttpwwwredditcomhelpreddiquette Please  Dont worry about Karma and dont worry about seeming like youre a noob No one really cares Upvote lots downvote sparingly Obviously you might have other ideas with how you vote but I find this the most effective Learn the formatting for commentsposts Its helpful Anyway the most important thing is to have fun Reddit takes pride in being classy ie we like reading posts and comments from people who type with literacy and good punctuation Redditors also like making fun of themselveseach other Dont feel bad if you get jabbed with a joke about you being single It happens to everyone There is a subreddit for everyone and everything delve deeper than the front page to find other areas with news you find enjoyable Dont overuse internet memes most of us find it annoying when were reading a thread in the comments and this pops up AND MY AXE Most of all though new Redditors karma does NOT matter Youve got a right to

for reddit Reddit has the least obtrusive ads I have ever seen on a website And for that they deserve the ad revenue What makes reddit special For video posts  the little box with the play button beneath them will actually play the video in the Reddit page Took me six months before I realized that Then again Im pretty dumb People may have a letter in brackets after their postscomments  S The

Edit this Reddit not exactly getting it Sorry for the noobness P lurked for a long while via twitter finally joined today Read the reddiquettehttpwwwredditcomhelpreddiquette The most important guideline that everyone tends to break is Please dont downvote opinions just because you disagree with them The down arrow is for comments that add nothing to the discussion Your saved links are stored in a tab at the top next to whats hot new and controversial This September huh Are you implying that it might be eternalhttpenwikipediaorgwikiEternalSeptember edit since  other people have made the same witty comment as I and earlier Im gonna give some advice When you submit a post you cannot include both a link and text You must choose between either one right this is for new people because they are going back to school it has nothing to do with digg Lets make a reddit glossary Ive found that Reddit Uppers and Downershttpuserscriptsorgscriptsshow and Reddit Comment Boxeshttpuserscriptsorgscriptsshow are very useful greasemonkey scripts Re upvotingdownvoting comments This is how the vast majority of people automatically assume upvotesdownvotes work  Upvote I AGREE  Downvote I DISAGREE And this is how Reddiquettehttpwwwredditcomhelpreddiquette please read it advises users to upvotedownvote  Upvote This was an interestinginformativefunny post whether I agreed with the overall content or not It added to the discussion  Downvote This post added absolutely nothing to the discussionwas spamwas racist or derogatory Its perfectly usual to upvote a comment even if you dont agree with any of it Reddit should be a place of enlightened discussion rather than simply an enforcing of the hivemind opinion Somebody posting something positive about Sarah Palin  whatever that could be  is not automatic grounds for mass downvotes However saying that anybody who doesnt realise what a shining example of humanity she is is a dumb ass hippie communist nigger muslim well thats obviously fair game On a related topic the upvotedownvote system is a more than adequate replacement for posts like LOL nice post and you suck So please dont make those posts because youre just clogging up Reddit with pointless crap However I dont think any of this will ever really catch on But the more of us that try the better the site will be Is there some sort of reddit history archive Reddit noob here I just thought Id stop in to say how awesome the community here is Ive lurked on Digg for years now and never once felt the desire to post I actually converted before the exodus Here just seems different though it feels more welcoming More positive Anyway dont change I like what I see   Proper spelling and grammar go a long way Reddit Enhancement

my tips I find that instead of ignoring sections of the community by selectively subscribing to things I choose to view discussions and links from all subreddits I do this with the following two links  httpwwwredditcomralltoptday  I visit this several times a day I really have a feel for this site by reading the daily happeningstrends I find that the best comment threads to read and comment in are  to  hours old I find that is my hotspot for  having enough discussions to read to be satisfied and  have a thread young enough that if I make a reply I am pretty sure people will see it and maybe even interact with it  httpwwwredditcomralltopthour  I look at this several times a day too Often just when I am bored with everything on the prior page I linked to Its usually only the top  to  links on this page that Im actually interested in I subscribe to reddits solely for supporting their growth and traffic I tend to switch reading sections of reddit using the URL bar in my browser I might want to go straight to the best IAmA posts of the week so ill just type in httpwwwredditcomriamatoptweek Why Well theres a lot of subreddits out there and different ways to sort each and I also tend to browse reddit on a variety of different devices so I cant count on things like bookmarks all the time Here are two handy javascript snippets that you might find handy some day and you should bookmark them You use them by pasting them into your URL bar while viewing a comment page and hitting enter Or just by clicking the bookmark  Show images

Theres a lot of different things that you can do with reddit comment syntax Either find a guide for it or just wait and learn it as you go It took me a long time to figure everything out Might come in handy one day to figure out how to get the json or rss from any page just add it to the end of a URL What else Be courteous Conciseness grammar and punctuation all stem from this Dont be afraid to stick your neck out with your opinion but respect everyone around you If you think someones a troll just ignore them They hate that the most  Moderators are not administrators and they cant do much in general You should ask them if things you comment or submit dont seem to show up for other people They can hide comments and submissions and they can also unhide ones that have been filtered by the spam algorithm Try to be nice when you message them  Read usernames This can be important and you may not be used to doing it They can make comments more entertaining or insightful to read You will also start noticing notable people The Administrators for instance Or novelty accounts like NonsensicalAnalogy or Lookofdisapproval As for the visual look of reddit I mademodified a greasemonkey script that colors comments based on what score they have It takes a bit longer to load comment pages but if you have a good connection and you like the novelty of it its worth that drawback Youll need the Firefox web browser the Greasemonkey addon and then you can download this scripthttpuserscriptsorgscriptsshow Enjoy your stay A few tips  Reddit is the front for chan If you wander into the wrong subreddits it is just as bad or good depending on how you look at it  If you have political views outside the norm feel free to join rlibertarian ranarchism rsocialism rconservative rronpaul or any of the other smaller subreddits  FOR THE LOVE OF THE ALMIGHTY FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER DONT SUBMIT BLOGSPAM  FOR THE LOVE OF CTHULHU DONT REPOST THINGS OR MrOhHai WILL KNOCK DOWN YOUR DOOR WITH AN AXE AND YELL AT YOU FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS  CAPSLOCK IS NOT CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL IT IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR DOUCHBAGGERY  Resistance is Futile You cannot resist the pull of the hivemind  We like to think of ourselves as pompous intellectuals If you burst our happy bubble we will put you into space and you will burst  Dont feed the trolls anything but trollbait we dont want them to grow any larger  You will be shunned if you dont correctly use their there theyre your youre and so on  The admins can see your IP Dont fuck with Reddit or they will backtrace you and call the cyberpolice EDIT Added a few more subreddits thanks to ZachRB If it is exists there is a subreddit for it  Its the community Other than slashdot I cant think of any other place where Id be more eager to read the comments than the story Most of the other places anything more than skimming through the comments becomes boring real quick Secondly because of certain themed reddits it provides an avenue for people to provide us with their life experiences Not that it makes me consider people in here to be better than people who flock to other communities it just helps you feel more in touch with the pulse of the crowd here People started becoming more than the stands they took on issues  For me the fact that you customize the shit out of this site is the killer feature Oh and admins that dont walk talk or censor like normal admins is a pretty nice feature too Before I forget Id like to thank the mods and staff members who put in way more effort than I can begin to imagine in the pursuit of combating spam In my  years of perusing reddit Ive only had like a handful of occasions when I ran into spammers I find that incredibly surprising when I think about it now I know that reddit has fought long and hard against spam and as a normal user of this site Id just like to say that your efforts have not gone in vain and is appreciated a lot  This one was easy raskscience rcoding rsoccer rscience  No Remember the time people used to throw around the word spartan to describe Reddits interface I like it to stay that way I am thankful that you guys havent planned as of yet to yank the Compress Link Display feature yet But heres one thing Id like to ask though Just how functional is the tailoring of front page to the users preferences on this site I get the feeling that my front page doesnt reflect my voting activity as much as Id like it to Or am I just being a whiny bitch The front page is entirely customizable to your likes wants and needs httpwwwredditcomreddits Has the collapse of Digg caused a spike in traffic I so desperately want more reddit friends Please read the FAQs in each subreddit if they have one Reddit is special because it exists Being able to discuss whatever is on your mind and relate to such a supportive and critic community is pure and simply just awesome For the first month of my membership at this lovely webplace I didnt bother to change my default subreddits Boy did I have egg on my face I have now have a custom subscription of subreddits so reddit is no longer a faceless internet page and instead is my reddit Click on the nifty EDIT  button on the top right or go to httpwwwredditcomreddits to change your reddits For the completely uninitiated subreddits are content specific mini reddits They often have custom stylesheets and a slightly different community atmosphere Dont worry if there isnt a whole lot of activity in a subreddit it will still show up on your home page each subreddit has a weighting factor so upvotes are relative   What makes reddit special Id have to say the ability to call ourselves out on our own bullshit is one of my favorite things Yeah were stupid as a community sometimes but were not above looking at ourselves and laughing MOST of the time Reddit is progressive and full of nice caring people But sometimes its filled with whiny little adultchildren who need to just be ignored because its not worth the headache Or call them out Your choice  What are some cool aspects of the site that might not be immediately obvious to new users Which of the default settings should be changed ASAP I dont care what the hivemind says try out the reddit siteframe I like it Go read up on your reddiquette too Its at the bottom of the page Every page  What are your favorite communities that arent in the default

install the Reddit Comment BoxeshttpsaddonsmozillaorgenUSfirefoxaddon and reddit Uppers and Downershttpuserscriptsorgscriptsshow user scripts for it Youll be glad you did Just a quick list of things  Please read the reddiquettehttpwwwredditcomhelpreddiquette  If theres one thing you should take from the reddiquette it is please dont downvote simply because you do not agree with the post  When submitting an article avoid sensationalizing the headline as much as possible  Dont worry too much about karma its not really worth anything Dont let downvotes deter you from posting your honest opinion  The admins are stellar If you have a problem with something make a post about it or contact them through feedbackhttpwwwredditcomfeedback They really do listen  The community is what makes this site great Give to it and itll give back to you  Subreddits are your friend If you find one you like be sure to subscribe to it This will make posts in them show up on your front page You can also unsubscribe from any of the default subreddits that dont appeal to you This has probably been said in this massive thread But Ill say it again Generally speaking people here are pretty nice and trustworthy We have rsnackexchangersnackexchange where you can trade local snacks with another Redditor for their local snacks We have rsecretsantarsecretsanta which has been used not only for a December Secret Santa but also a July Arbitrary Day with the same general rules We have a rfavorsrfavors where you can make a favor requestoffer Theres guy on there now offering some free figs Just yesterday on the frontpage a Redditor tipped another Redditor  for not getting a tip on a massive pizza delivery Those are the types of things that happen here Dont screw it up Also consider sorting by best instead of top Its right under any original post It sorts comments by an algorithm to help determine what comments are good rather than simply with the most points This helps comments get attention that werent posted immediately after the thread was started and thereby likely to have the most points deleted Perfect timing with the high number of new users coming from Digg If you wish to see all links go to httpwwwredditcomrall You can combine subreddits such as httpwwwredditcomrwtfgadgetswhalebait Alternatively you can type in subredditredditcom eg httpaustraliaredditcom  You can friend people And most importantly if you see someone posting someones personal details such as phone number andor address do not hesitate to message the moderators of that subreddit click the link above the moderators box to the left and inform them They will remove that commentpost ASAP  we dont like people doing that sort of stuff around here Hello Reddit pleased to meet you all Thank you for all the advice Clever logo Reddit hasnt hit eternal September yet Metareddithttpmetaredditcom is very useful in finding subreddits to personalize your homepage with Only the top subscribed subreddits are included on a new users frontpage Youll likely want to change it to your liking In the top right corner yo can see the word edit Click it You can now manage your frontpage content Unsubscribe from

guidehttpwwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsxahmohdiggyoutriedpiccaqcc I read somewhere that Digg is a website trying to be a community and reddit is a community trying to be a website Content is really important on reddit but just as important if not more is the community If you stick around before you know it reddit will start creeping into other parts of your life You might meet up with some fellow redditors you met on ryourcity or ryour school You might exchange giftshttpredditgiftscom with a redditor during the holidays or just receive a random act of kindnesshttpwwwredditcomtbdp which is pretty common Reddit might even inspire you to be a better personhttpwwwmediabistrocombaynewserbayareanewmediaredditraisesoverforhaitireliefasp Who knows The point is reddit is not just a news aggregator the same way chan is not just an image board Although were nothing like chan except for rchanhttpwwwredditcomrchan If you in any way intend to use Reddit for things with names like search engine optimization or new media marketing fuck off Be prepared to spend minutes thinking WTF are they downvoting this comment so heavily Are they fucking stupid or what To counteract just add some bacon to the end of every comment Bacon there is a white H in between the up and down arrows It looks as if kevin rose is personally responding to many of the rude comments made about him and the digg redesign on his twitter page httptwittercomkevinrose Hes saying this is the th revolt theyve experienced and that users will come back no matter what Hi Digg refugee here Ive been browsing reddit for awhile now but after seeing this post combined with the falling out of digg Ive finally tipped over to registering Im glad reddit is so warm towards new users I have one question though whats with the novelty accounts I find them very entertaining since they often quite witty and a very reddit specific phenomenon  it never happens on digg How did this become a trend My favorite subreddit so far is askreddit You guys are amazing when I read these stories I feel like Im around by a bunch of friends by a campfire spinning yarns and cracking jokes I love it I really hope Reddit continues to be our last refuge on the internet with this huge new influx of people It would suck if it was Eternal September all over again i remember when i migrated to Reddit AskReddit was what did it for me the forumlike interaction but with a very open and welcoming community and the general hilarity that came with most of the posts was awesome plus reddit has a crapload of links per page so it was more efficient than browsing Diggs pages and pages to see if you missed anything cool What about reddit do you find ugly or annoying or buggy Do you have workarounds Perhaps a GreaseMonkey script or Stylish module You see that envelope next to your name in the top right When its orangered that means there are unread replies to your posts When its gray there are not If you happen to play World of Warcraft there is a very active reddit guild located on the Sargeras realm We are currently the most populated guild on the server and the server is high pop You can find our subreddit herehttpwwwredditcomrredditguild get ready to handle puns and wordplay to a level even your high school english teacher would scorn at Please no blog spam and if you find something cool out in the real world take a picturewrite a story thats what makes reddit awesome a lot of the content is from you The reddit rrandomhttpwwwredditcomrrandom will send you to a random SFW reddit Randnsfwhttpwwwredditcomrrandnsfw will send you to a random NSFW reddit Its magical If youre submitting a picture use imgurhttpimgurcom Why is it so amazing  The interface is very simple and straightforward  It doesnt require an account  It doesnt have any bandwidth limitations  The uptime is light years beyond places like imageshack and photobucket  The person who created the site is an active Redditor  Using anything else almost universally results in being given The Face of Disapproval Exdigg user here with a questioncomment Comment first actually The content here is great Everything is new and fresh and having been terribly disappointed with every bit of news to hit the front page on digg in the last week this is a sight for sore eyes Question now I am finding the comment system to be the biggest thing to attempt to get used to here and was wondering if there were any tips on the subject I used to sort digg comment by most dugg and look at the top comments expanding the thread only if it seemed like it would provoke interesting discussion Sorting by most dugg would sort universally so no matter if a comment was a reply to a reply it would get sorted to the top if it had the most votes I could open the thread to see what spurred such a reply if it happen to be such or what replies it may have generated Here it appears that threads are maintained and replies stay nested under an original post The ranking of the original comment is all that gets sorted This is only frustrating because threads here seem to become very large before a new thread is started which keeps the second comment thread tucked way down below And even if the th comment within a thread has the highest votes and correct me if Im wrong here it can only be found  comments down under the original comment Perhaps this is just one of those things I must get used to but I feel like it increases the probability of missing highly rated comments simply because they are buried so deep This question became longer than I expected it to be Sorry I am bored at work  Please dont follow minimeme link sagas where every third link is about the same topic Past examples include peoples dogs in their cars and the like Honestly  of us dont care about how your dog sits in your car just because someone else has a dog that sits in their car in a really weird way that was worth posting a picture of doesnt mean you need to try to follow suit  Be thoughtful with your upvotes and downvotes Dont downvote stories or comments just because you disagree with them downvote them because they are of poor quality or detract from the subject at hand Upvote insightful comments too often the top  comments on a deep topic are oneliner puns  Please dont treat reddit as an extension of b Its a joke that reddit is the tamer version of b but I think that few of us actually want to be like b b isnt funny on the whole its immature  That said reddit aspires to be intelligent Dont observe that and then get caught up in the groupthink and assume because your opinion is popular then you are smart Groupthink is often wrong or at least incomplete Your opinions are not more valid just because a lot of a subreddit agrees with you  Please post in the appropriate subreddits  Please keep selfreddit submissions to a minimum Please do not use it as a way to talk to other users  Tag NSFW items as

it httpenwikipediaorgwikiEternalSeptember If you are trolling reddit at work take a break every  minutes and do  minutes of work Otherwise youll get nothing done Just because it looks like a page of HTML circa  doesnt mean it isnt better than digg My   this isnt Digg  your community isnt controlled in the same way and youre not spoon fed you what a handful of powerusers and admins think you should read and engage with Thanks to the way the site is developed and run you have a degree of power over how the community evolves and develops Those of us who have been here a while have generally made it a positive place to discover new ideas laugh our asses off and actually talk about subjects of substance If your contribution here engenders any one of those three youll get along great with the existing community One thing to remember is that each subreddit is its own community and operates by its own set of rules and has its own particular focus Read the right sidebar for any notes the mods of the reddit have put up for information to get a sense of how to best contribute And yes its insanely easy to create your own reddithttpwwwredditcomredditscreate If you dont mix well into some moderators particular fiefdom make your own TLDR Digg was closed Reddit is open and is what you make it As such the community here has developed a sense of ownership and pride in the quality of the site and we hope that you do as well And with great power comes great ehh fuck it Ahah I have contributed this Just ordered my Reddit Tshirt and told all the programmers about Reddit Reddit is confusing as hell I like it Im just not sure why I dont know what karma points are so I probably need more Somehow The new Digg is more confusing Makes this place look almost easy You should add a search feature from our pages And a search function that is by time I just looked for something and it was  months old and I couldnt comment I actually had something useful to say Link karma can be used to purchase powerful positions in the government of your native land This is why it is absolutely necessary to post a picture of a cat doing a silly thing wait  weeks and repost it in another completely unrelated subreddit i wish this was here when i started Has to be an upgoat as many diggers are here now and morphing into redditors I am new my girlfriend managed to get me lurking tips are appreciated on the settings front You seem to get a lot of former digg users which I am not but I lurk hard on boingboing and slashdot surge of new users Dont forget about Digg The first rule of Reddit search function is You DO NOT talk about the search function Herp derp do I love rcirclejerk Sure you dont want to just add rapocalympics Edit apparently this is now private and you can go to rApocalympicsrio instead This announcement gave me Zika Please dont add to default subs Every single one rapidly becomes a cesspool Let the current ones sit there and just let people know about other subs dont force the trash into them Could we get a live death toll in the sidebar deleted I vote for rapocalympics thanks now I can filter it in advance You guys should just get rid of defaults altogether Are you going to do this to every topical event Football world cup basketball world cup euro cups I hope there wont be too much backlash when you dont do the same with rparalympics later on   Because this is a topical event with a global audience weve added rolympics to the default communities set for the duration of the Olympics What does this have to do with the event being tropical Edit Im keeping it ok Would the sub be censored to remove negative articles regarding the conditions of the Rio Olympic New logohttpiimgurcomZmoVicjpg Credit to uBillyTheMagicToilet No thanks Wasnt there talk a while back of removing the concept of defaults Is temporary defaults a new concept for this Are you planning on doing that for any other events like this Its an interesting idea at least I wonder where it sits on the path to the goal of getting rid of default subs Thank you RES for your filtering capabilities how much did they pay you Hopefully that sub isnt as much of a trainwreck as the Olympics are already proving to be Another sub to avoid why rolympics has been a terrible sub for the past two olympics terrible content as well as not so good moderation during the sochi olympics the highest rated post was like  and it was about the olympic village terrible conditions This sub should not be set as a default because it has not earned it at all I am boycotting this sub and everything about it going into the olympics hoping a better one will come about deleted Given the daily problems in general dont you think it would be more appropriate to add rapocalympics no Can we ban the Russian subreddits for the set duration of the Olympics It only makes sense deleted How about adding rparalympics when it opens These guys need support too Who do we need to talk to in order to get them to change their banner to the updated biohazardhttpiimgurcomFApqkDjpg one Courtesy of unephelus herehttpswwwredditcomrfunnycommentsvqrjduetoallthehealthhazardssurroundingtherio rapocalympics deleted Yay a new shitshow default Cant wait the way these Olympics are turning out so far before theyve even started lol this sub should be more fun than rarrow Filtering rolympics from my reddit Thanks for the heads up can you please add rcumdumpsters to default our poor little community is trying to get off the ground and we could use a little boost deleted what about rOhlympics Your default communities set link is broken and doesnt work How much is NBC paying you to do this deleted There goes the neighborhood rolympics will just become another sub filled with endless offtopic jokes memes and puns I really wish the comment quality was better because having a interesting informative and serious discussion is almost impossible here the same goes for the comments in this Announcement thread Not gonna lie why dont you just have sports hub bar on reddit People like sports what a shocker ITT Hilarious and original MAKE rAPOCALYMPICS A DEFAULT joke here deleted GO CHLOE DYGERT My Niece is on the Olympic Cycling Team I hope all of you will wish them luck But why Im sure a lot of us dont give  shits about the Olympics People who do care already know where to look They dont need it automatically on reddit Edit Im just saying that casual users interested in the Olympics could just turn on almost any TV in the world and find Olympic info Or hell you can just Google olympics resultshttplmgtfycomqolympicsresults and get literally evertyhing Reddit doesnt need to hand hold Fitting that even though there is nothing wrong with this it is already a disaster Yeah guys we get it rapocalympics exists You can stop with the hilarious jokes now Your link to redditblogcom gives me a nice big  Something something rapocalympics I will be unsubscribing immediately  Can we not Please dont At least tell us how much NBC paid you Cmon This year Olympics are more like the Hunger Games How many athletes can survive the deadly traps of Rio  These idiots had terrible timing Why in hell would you host your crappy little event the same time as the Dota  Internationalhttpwwwdotacominternationaloverview  I mean they are definetly going to lose thousands of viewers I hope somone got fired over that decision Terrible terrible idea The Olympics are a money making sham since U is a global sensation and are surely still topical were going to shove their new album onto every unsuspecting iTunes user we talked to U about this and they are happy to share their music with everyone Thanks one more shitshow I have to manually unsubscribe from Go ahead and ban me while youre at it mods God the comments on all the rannouncements threads are so ridiculous How on earth can you be upset about this Its a really obvious move WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK REDDIT IF I WANTED A SOFTCORE SCAT PORN AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS GLORIFYING SUBREDDIT ON MY FRONT PAGE ID HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO SPACEDICKS TWICE STOP THIS RETARDED MONEYGRABBING SHIT Fuck you How about we dont do it due to the conditions of the olympics Or rapocalympics Im curious to see how reddit figures out a way to negatively overreact to this like they do with every admin announcement Hey just to let you know I dont see a problem with this Thumbs up deleted Will it be readded every two years or how will it be handled dope I loved when rworldcup was in the default set because it meant that I got to share my love of soccer with people who maybe werent going to otherwise actively seek it out Adding rapocalympics next That seal looks awfully clean Why isnt rsports as a default good enough Im sure notable things that happen in the Olympics will end up there Never been to that sub before but pretty sure itll turn into dog shit now Well For everyone except Russia I can just uncheck it so I dont mind much I dont find the Olympics entertaining in the slightest I cant wait to see all the posts about the open water swimmers having fresh dookies floating into their mouths midrace I think you should hire a better marketing director If reddits revenues are low but your visits are up then you are doing something wrong You cant expect folks to pour out their resources to you while you arent actively soliciting companies that you feel would serve us well PennyArcade found a market for themselves with the help of Mr Robert Khoo Reddit needs its own Robert Khoo Put some resources towards that Engineers are horrible salesman  edit  Im not the first to say it so go through upvote those who did say it but reddit has some very marketable subreddits that advertisers would love Selling ads for Valve Blizzard Bethesda Softworks etc via rgaming rwow rXBOX etc Sell ads for hulu Netflix Amazon on rentertainment rscifi rFringe rLOST etc Sell adds for Bangbros RealityKings Daredorm etc on rNSFW rGONEWILD etc this seems really obvious to me Find ways to categorize subreddits so they can be sold in bulk and give advertisers the option to stay out of reddits that arent in their demographic or go against their corporate philosophy You have the markets You just dont have the marketing I want an email redditcom Im a bit torn I love reddit and would gladly pay a bit now and then for it and probably will But youre not a couple of college guys anymore You are owned by a corporate entity and a big one at that If people donate its winwin for CN hey look we dont have to put any money into reddit the users are doing it for us I want to buy Reddit Ive tried to contact someone before but I suppose my message wasnt taken seriously I am interested in understanding who I can talk to over at Conde Nast about buying Reddit The fact that your team has remained exactly the same size for the past two years seems fairly indicative that the parent company isnt seeing the future returns for which to invest now I have the necessary funds to invest in Reddit to ensure that you can ride your growth to success Sites with far less presence are very profitable there is no reason why Reddit cant be the same But you cant do it with just  guys constantly firefighting code You need a few million dollars of upfront investment in a bigger team and better resources I can provide this Who do I contact at Conde Nast to see if they are interested EDIT Im just a reddit lurker in my midtwenties with access to funds I am only posting this to see a if there is a specific person or team to initiate contact with privately than for me to just reach out with a message to the generic contact info that Conde Nast has which I will try eventually and b if there are others that would also be interested in joining a bid Discussing if Im legit or not is really pointless since Im not asking anything from any of you deleted Here ill post a sad story about me trying to support reddit I tried to advertise my game on reddit  times I would pay  and have reddit display my ad The first time I tried it I couldnt really count the amount of sales I got because of another promotion The second time I was really excited to see what kind of a difference reddit makes It turns out I had  sales that day Apparently users didnt like me advertising the game so they bought one and returned it so I would loose  of the sale That was the first time I lost a sale Ooh well Would Bing or Google give you any money for using a branded search The existing search isnt very useful and MS is trying to drum up business I would definitely pay for more vanity features like sorting my own commentssubmissions by karma a graph of karma over time richer API access assigning colors to friends custom sidewide CSS automated message on my birthday ability to vote on new features protection against Candlejack etc However in the course of writing this comment I had a sudden flashback to the dot com days Id definitely buy your service if you added XYZ And then the customer doesnt even  a button you could press to smack someone in the face over the Internet Glad to see you guys have been reading my emails I will certainly pay  for this button Reddit Gold bitch smack How about leave it as is and do a yearly donation drive like NPR deleted Your sponsored links have grown my business substantially in the last year and seriously changed my life for the better So it is with sincere gratitude that I donated to reddit gold Thanks guys keep up the excellent work Ahhh the freemium model The very reason I lost an elevator pitch competition Im not even kidding you should make the names of subscribers a different color or a different font or something  People pay for even the slightest inkling of extra individuality  You should be asking yourselves what you can do so some redditors feel more special than others then sell them on that EDIT Or there could be trophies for donations Redditors seem to love donating to good causes so it doesnt seem like too much to ask for them to donate to the place that allows them to make all those donations to good causes Ive scattered a few replies here and there but I want to address my biggest concern with this Slashdot implemented a subscriber feature many years ago and I became a subscriber right off the bat I could disable ads add one point to my post score that didnt add to my karma a good idea for reddit potentially and had a few more features I dont remember This was great for about a year until Slashdot realized not enough money was coming in from subscriptions Thus marketingfriendly Slashdot was born Fake news stories that were merely advertising in disguise disruptive advertising and more all came to the site Now I rarely visit and I havent paid my subscription since the first adbased story hit the front page Please dont let reddit become another Slashdot by putting all of your hopes on a subscription model and realizing too late that it isnt working I love this community and I dont want to see it wither  This post is only available to reddit gold subscribers Reddit has provided me at least  worth of entertainment over the past  years I would happily pay a few  I would prefer to pay a one off fee  having to pay monthly would be a huge turnoff Also no PayPal or any system that requires me to make an account please Hi there First thank you for the amazing work that you do for all of us I well understand your point about Conde Nast Youre right that the way corporate work What bothers me its that if one day reddit start to make benefits Conde Nast will be here to heard it Trust me I will be glad to give some bucks to keep you guys working on this great place If it were a nonprofit you will already have receive something from me BUT this is a forprofit So if us the users start to put some money in this business lets call a cat a cat what will guarantee us that our money will be well use in the long term My point is that in some countries like my france yep I sure you already got it from my bad english there is something we call society of readers and sometimes society of writters If we by putting money on the table will allow reddit to continues running why cant we as a group also have a kind of power in exchange of our investment It could be shares or anything else Just something that guarentee us to have a voice about the futur of reddit I dont have a lot to spare but Im about to send  your way cause well I only spend money in increments of pi Makes getting gas a bitch EDIT oooh yeahhttpiimgurcomqhONbjpg Heres a thought for a Reddit Gold feature How about the ability to monitor all your noveltythrowaway accounts from one page Seems like people whove been here a while are A more likely to have a couple of accounts and B more likely to want to join Reddit Gold Also Reddit Gold How about Reddit Unobtainium or Reddit Jedi or something Give them the ability to search The rest of us are used to not having this feature Absolutely no monthly program But I have no problem donating what I can when I can How much is Reddit worth Id pay  for a share D I know its kinda utopic but it would be awsome if Reddit was owned by its readers  While reddit is admittedly short on engineers it also seems to be short on businesssavvy leaders I already mentionedhttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentscnecanyoneelsethinkredditsjobboardneedstobe the job board needs revamping and could be a source of revenue for the site Theres a bunch of other opportunities as well ie starting a specialized market research group and conducting pollsrunning surveys adding to the community feel by integrating a gifts model  la Facebook or even recruiting Redditors to help with the work in exchange a snazzy orange username title All these are ideas off the top of my head Im sure youd be able to think up some much better ones It doesnt seem like Reddit has a real business plan and thats why Conde Nast is content keeping you guys on the back burner Personally Im not willing to pay for online content and no matter how cool the donation benefit is Ill always pass On that note I also wont be happy if I learn that Reddit is offering improved service to members who donated Reddit should consistently help its community rather than have the community help the company PS If you downvote please leave a comment P TLDR Donations are for suckers You lot need to think of new revenue streams As long as the gold members dont have access to certain goldonly posts or youre at a great disadvantage being a basic member Im fine with this I fear that itll come to a point where you have to donate to get anything out of reddit though  or itll turn into a bragging contest I would happily donate  I just dont have the funds right now nor will I in the foreseeable future unfortunately Donated Not sure how I feel about exclusive features for subscribers I say keep it open with no bonus features for now and see how it goes do a kind of a early roll outbeta program for new features regular users will be mad if power users start flaunting screen shots but everyone likes to have the inside scoop on stuff i know there is some of this already based somewhat I think on seniority but maybe making it an official roll out scheme for new features would be kind of cool I work  jobs One of my jobs that I do in my spare time is create websites My websites using nothing more than Adsense pull in almost enough every month to pay my rent this is after costs My websites combined pull in less than half a million page views a month I dont even have hard working contributors writing my content for me I do it all alone Im not sure what you guys are doing wrong but I have never asked for a cent from a single visitor or had to beg them for money I figure one of three things either I am doing something right you guys are doing something terrible wrong or you guys are actually pretty well off and trying to capitalize on a bunch of suckers who already write  of your content for you  a month is far more annoying than  or even  dollars a year So what are you going to do when powertripping moderators like neoronin on rindia ban paying customers as part of personal grudges Do you refund our money for failing to provide the service we pay for Reddit clearly doesnt care about abusive moderators now Why dont you try removing ads for Gold Members Id bet  of the people techsavvy enough to want to pay for Reddit already have adblock so its mostly symbolic but its a nice symbol and should still be cashflow positive Making the blog post on a payday Well played admins well played You win I gave money So basically the multi billion dollar media conglomerate Conde Nast will own a social media site where the users generate all the content AND pay to view it as well as view banner ads Fucking A dude For all you suckers thinking of donating Ive got a bridge in Brooklyn you might be interested in too Alright Im at about comment  and I doubt anyone shall read this but who knows Ill put a bit of time into it because I care Seriously Very quickly I came from Diggcom to Reddit not too long ago This place is amazing The variety and the community make this place So heres a few thoughts that deserve feedback if you have the time I am interested in keeping this place alive  You are open source Have you reached out to the talented thousands that could help you out They are there they are willing Have you requested The community here helps each other why not Mother Reddit  You have a limited staff you say you fall behind your promising fixes because of maintenance This is odd for me It connects a little with  laterally I think that if you said hold on shut the site down for a month to investigate repair and so on and had a separate location for things such as donating then you could gain your footing again Check this out You have that decoy page if you will filled with ads and equipped with a donate button Guess how many people would either set that as their homepage donate a few bucks or both I would I just got here and I can appreciate this place  Im sure weve all seen it but what is this digg vs reddit google search graphhttpwwwgooglecomtrendsqredditdigg  Reddit is on the rise Digg is doing it wrong Cant you seriously put together an incredible proposal to those with money and spell out your problem This is the future of the internet This type of aggregationbehemoth which brings me to    If youre on the rise and you can manage a few additional ads a subscriber system an easily accessible donation system or even a subscription system that is simply a monthly donation where no additional privileges are given example  cents a month and become more efficient with use of the power of open source I dont see where you couldnt turn a profit without ruining your site Just my input Dear  people that will read this Where do you agree Where am I wrong asl Reddit is owned by Conde Nast a billiondollar corporation like Time Warner or Cobra and if they wanted to they could hire a thousand engineers and purchase a million dollars worth of heavy iron I have only one suggestion Please do not incentivize payments ie only Gold members can view this post OR a Gold member thread can only be viewed by other Gold members kinda thing It just does not work Instead have a targeted funding drive of some kind Start a one month drive for raising money by selling reddit alien shirts or mugs OR sell redditcom email accounts for  a year I wish I had any constructive ideas except selling one product a daywoot style or selling a reddit alien lollipop for  But in any case please do not give special benefits to Gold members that in my opinion is a destructive tactic So then from a commercial standpoint why would someone want to be a Gold Member Oh and removing ads for Gold members is a good idea but if I was a Gold member I would feel cheated cos reddits one of the very few sites where ads are this unobstructive I really suspect this will get downvoted into infinity thats assuming anyone even gets down this far to read this comment but  Good grief NO Are you HIGH ABSOLUTELY categorically NOT You sold the site to Conde Nast for Gods sake As users were supposed to deal with all the negatives of corporate ownership such as the attempted Sears censorship for example without the one possibly singular positive adequate site funding to reach the heights you aspire to And how the hell are you guys as a team putting up with the idiocy of having a corporate owner that gives you no pros but already has given you a ton of cons I mean seriously You guys need to grow a set of cojones walk up to whomever your next step in the ownership chain with Conde Nast is and tell them to cough up the dough or else what the hell did they buy the site for No sorry Half of America is unemployed at this point and the other half that have jobs are holding onto them for dear life Your request that we suddenly start funding the site when you guys are already monetizing this thing out the wazoo with advertisements and corporate ownership is an insane request to make at this point in the worlds current economic climate Were this a boom time when people would be flush with more money itd be slightly less stupid To make this nowadays is an idiotic request to make and if you have anyone who youre paying money to give you marketing or development advice and they signed off on this idea you need to seriously consider laying them off You made your educatedguess bets on funding when you sold the entire site kit and kaboodle to Conde Nast If youre having problems with it now you dont get to have your cake and eat it too You want to grow a pair and give us something PROACTIVE to get behind then yes damn it you have a loyal userbase which will rally behind you because there is a community of people here who like it here And yes you deserve the credit for that But not this weaksister crap youve dished out with this very poorly thoughtout request Listen you want to come to the userbase with a plan to buy Reddit back from Conde Nast and have it be a userowned website Thats something users will get behind Or even to a lesser degree you want to offer Reddit Gold memberships that have solid concrete membership benefits now as a product Well that kind of sucks and I agree with those who say itd fuck up the existing egalitarianism of the site but at least its a fucking plan here folks we will give you this in exchange for this You want to say Errrrrrr um give us whatever youd like to give us and youll have  uh  well for now our appreciation and a nice PNG to display in your web browser Yeah sorry thats a reaaaaaaaaalllly halfassed idea to go public with But when you have a corporate owner no you dont get to do the hat in hand begging thing with your users Its an insult to your users and its a stupidasallhell and culturally insensitive move to make to boot tldr Reddit Userbase to You NO If your corporate owners are being skinflints its your job to handle funding problems and its asinine to ask us to make up for that shortcoming especially when we have to deal with a heavy corporate hand poking into site policies  Minimum of  donation  Allow gold members to select colors for their usernames  Vuvzuela button Thats all I can think of for now Please papa raldi tell us is Reddit going to be able to survive through the winter Recurring payments despite maybe not being hugely popular are the way to do this One off payments or a pledge drive style system to raise money arent going to be predictable will take a lot of your time to organise and will generally piss people off every time they happen On the other hand if you give people the option to pitch in say mo automatically charged you get some significant benefits  Predictable stream of revenue each month  Small amount so most people wont even think about it  Once its set up its almost completely automated Personally Id be happy to sign up to something like this mo is not a big deal to me but if you can get  people doing it youll really be onto something I dont get why Reddit doesnt just run Google Adsense Seriously it would do all of the targeting for you and with Reddits traffic it would easily bring in tens of thousands of dollars a month if not more Sponsored search could also rake in millions if you were to sign a several year contract with either Google or Microsofts Bing Your search sucks anyways I currently help run a network of websites that traffic  million pageviews a month and our demographics and content suck compared to Reddit and we make bank its mainly video so we go through more bandwidth then Reddit probably even does Between Adsense TribalFusion and a few other ad networks and perhaps AdultFriendFinder on the adult subreddits you could easily make  a day if not more Asking for donations from your users when youre a part of a company who has a network of websites that constantly have ads running on them seems completely illogical Ask them for an advertising  sales person so you can increase revenue Im sure they will gladly assist you in making them more money You should sell name changes I bet theyll go like hotcakes I want to change my username retain all my activity and karma I am willing to pay  one time charge for that I am sure there are NovelyAccount holders that would want the same and want to pay you  per account per year for linking it to their main account Personally m is a reasonable amount Also the ability to access a persons full comments with subscription it should pass over to the API too would be awesome So yeah while Ill get reddit gold regardless of the features offered I would love if it would give more extensive access to user information via the API oh and a super important feature would be gifting reddit gold to other users Enter their username and gift it optional anonymity oh oh oh and I dont think youd ever do this but please dont make it so we can make posts or subreddits only accessible to gold members oh oh oh oh oh and how about the ability for gold members to subscribe to domains Id love notifications when one of my sites gets submitted thatd be pretty damn awesome For features Id like to see the ability to increase the limit on comments per page so I dont have to click load more comments a bunch just to read everything aaaaaand paypal makes another  for doing nothing A website that gets  million hits per month needs the people that helped make it popular to pay money to continue operating As Raldi said Conde Nast is a business one that wants to make money They dont see anything in Reddit that tells them it is a good investment why would I argue otherwise Honestly if Reddit cannot continue asis then it needs to be made a public company and money can be raised through stocks Again if Conde Nast does not see the benefit in this then what is the benefit in giving money directly I love Reddit but as someone who posts often for the last  years or so it is a little troublesome to be asked to pay money so all the new users dont crash the system To me this would be like taking private donations to clean the BP oil off a beach when there is already someone responsible for that money BP Make it yearly make is  like flickr and make it giftable Easypeasy Reddit Gold Parties IRL Open bar deleted As long as my money goes DIRECTLY to KeyserSosa jedberg ketralnis raldi and for hosting oh wait THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN As soon as you start asking readers for cash the TOILET at the HUMONGOUS Cond Nast Building will need to be k Thats how these things go Sooner or later the corporations that buy sites like reddit will stop They will realize the readersuserscustomers really dont want their money to be used to buy k GOLD SHITTERS Good luck with rattling a tin cup for a company that posted  BILLION in revenue Suggested Feature Gold members can doubleupvote one post per day deleted If I ever meet you Im going to buy you multiple beers This goes for the rest of the admins as well Thanks Oh and is that question monthly I used to pay month for TotalFark Id give that here Just give me an option other than GayPal Rupert Murdoch wants users to pay for online content reddit reacts with LOL GOOD FUCKING LUCK SUCK MY DICK Reddit wants users to pay for online content reddit reacts with THANK YOU SIR MAY I HAVE ANOTHER Whats with you people I just dont understand the mentality This isnt some indie company its Conde Nast Some of you are making a point of donating money Does this not seem strange to you Reddits parent company is seeing how far it can stretch reddits resources and you react by giving Conde Nast money Id buy a gold account if my name could be changed from blue to gold EDIT  Id pay up to  CAN I think people are OK with the idea of paying for things they like in an a la carte fashion This sort of public radio approach to fund raising is used in Wikipedia as well where it seems to work quite well Just have regular fund drives Youll get donations I guarantee it If I donate money will I no longer get ninjabanned whenever I post something that goes against the hive mind This blog post would be borderline pathetic if it wasnt tragic Somebody in Conde Nest PLEASE fire one of the engineers and hire a business developer marketer PR mogul to end this situation and make my fucking pass time profitable once and for all they can hire the engineer back in two months Its ridiculous that they cant turn a hefty profit with this many page views I have  left on an AmEx Gift Card work gives out bonuses on these cards so I was going to donate  to bring the card to an even  But alas Paypal cant authorize it for some reason  Edit Was getting denied because there was no contact info associated with the card to validate against name address phone Had to call AmEx to add this information  donatedhttpimgurcomhXxpng Youre creating a class segregation raldi Dividing the redditsilver havenots with the redditgold haveyeses I kid I kid But it will be interesting to add incentives for people to pay for the site while at the same time making sure that those who dont dont end up feeling bummed or left out like some second class citizens The elitist attitude on this site is already something to marvel One man  one vote must obviously remain But I love this site I mean I really love this site much like most of its users and I will support you guys no matter what you do Just out of curiosity though what does Digg do differently than reddit that it can manage to hire like  people and still like not resort to some form of Digg Gold Edit the like digg gold members can like be called Gold Diggers tm  But thats neither here nor there Just something I thought up of for my personal amusement I would prefer the site remaining free to all If you need to hire additional staff I think you should lease out more ad space Personally I think I would discontinue using reddit if I needed to pay for the privilege Why arent you working on a business case for Conde Nast that says this is why you should gives us more funding  Seems odd asking for donations for a site whose owner is a big publisher Wow  million page views and you cant keep  engineers hired full time or more Yikes You should be clocking down north of K a month just on advertising Ive advertised several times for various products and I didnt get any value from it But Im sure there are many companies that could get value from your readers demographic Just make it cheap enough for companies to not think twice about the money spent And stop the splitting of views up equally based on how much someone puts in Just sell per thousand impressions Advertisers like to know what theyre getting and not have to guess at it And you could really sell your impressions much cheaper than other outfits and youd have to since your viewers do NOT spend money as much as the demographics of other sites But even if you charged  cents per thousand impressions and sold that to  advertisers youd be raking it in Humble opinion Why not implement flattrbuttons onto reddit httpsflattrcom Some newspapers earned nearly k last month from readers who simply wanted to show their love Why not make reddit purely opensource and keep the  paid developers as the overseers who manage the codebase That way you dont take our money but our skillswhich is what you really need anyway What is your financial target Or if you prefer What is the salary of a reddit admin I am choosing a book for reading Just put in  bucks  Ill donate more if theres some worthwhile features Reddit has probably robbed my employer of at LEAST  of productivity If I were to donate now and later you added some sort of reward feature not just the awesome badge would you retroaward it to all existing donors or will we have to donate again Donated anyway just wondering what the future holds How is reddit supposed to make money except by displaying ads targeted at a demographic largely afflicted by ad blindness I know theres a store but there arent many things to buy and the stuff doesnt change too often Maybe you could organize something like Techdirt did for journalism which aims at finding ideas about how to monetize an industry Reddit Christmas song where all the top users get together and sing I dont know about monthly fees but a time donation of certain amounts should be able to get people certain things Im probably alone in this but I think you could add more ads to your page without bothering me at all  bucks PLUS my ex girlfriend Having voluntary subscribers is not a viable business model for a forprofit company And I wouldnt consider being a subscriber The main point is Conde Nast is comfortable with you at your current state I am pointing this out because I would like you guys to find a real solution to your problems Bestcase You get a lot of subscribers and your budget  subscription fees increases Conde Nast will drop your budget to the point you are currently at Profits goes back to the company Only thing that happens is some goodwilled people will be giving money to a large corporation that is not alright Unfortunately I think the problem comes down to adult content and your tolerance of it Lets do some math to see why this is the case You guys have M page views Thats  CPM units the unit advertising is purchased in You have  engineers Engineers fully loaded cost about K so at top end were looking at K  another K for server expense Kmonth seems pretty reasonable for outsourced hosting So were looking at K per year or less than Kmonth You have K units to sell every month to make a little more than K so you have to just sell your ads for  cent CPM and youd be profitable This seems incredibly doable Better yet you currently only have ONE ad slot per page most publisher sites have at least  and often  Add another x below the fold then add a x at the footer No one will notice or complain and even if you make abysmal CPMs you will make it to profitability But you guys arent doing that and youre smart guys Heres what I think is really happening and what youre really struggling with most of the growth and the bulk of the new PVs must not be monetizable Youre drawing an enormous amount of adult traffic jailbait NSFW gonewild FUUUUUUU etc you dont really want that cant have ads on it without resorting to friend finderporn ads which Conde probably doesnt want Not to mention top tier advertisers are afraid of a site whose number one search term is jailbait So these adult reddits are now a core part of the community and you cant kill them off without tanking traffic and severely undermining the community but businesswise they are only a cost center that makes your traffic look good but doesnt let you scale revenue with growth Beyond that your audience disproportionately uses AdBlock so your PVs and your ad impressions are wildly disproportionate And finally each user must probably churn PVsday which from an ad perspective is actually a really bad thing much better to have  people see an ad once per day then one person see the same ad x This is a tough situation guys you either kill off the adult stuff or split it off to another entity and increase your ad units or you make a payasyougosubscription model that actually works If you keep the adult stuff you MUST find a way to make them pay disproportionately more for their upkeep The final recommendation Id have is that Conde  Reddit has never been a logical match Conde should spin you guys back out to a Silicon Valley based investor that wants a top tier website with radical growth in its portfolio See StumbleUpon for reference For those curious this is the One more thing that was quoted in the previous blog post This is where the rbetateam folk can finally spill the beans  Thank you guys so much for not blabbing about it before it was ready Its made for some oddlooking threadshttpwwwredditcomrfffffffuuuuuuuuuuuucommentscrxdwsomemonthsyoujustcantseemtodoanythingcuszlacontext though  Edit to those asking how the rbetateam members were invited there were three avenues  I made a sponsored link to a blog posthttpblogredditcomlookingforsecretbetastriketeamhtml that I left live for about an hour where I told people to go subscribe to it about  people did  Then after the first gold announcement I offered to let gold members invite themselves about  people did  I invited anyone that PMd me a search complaint or suggestion on how to fix search for the last few weeks which was about  people Edit  Please stop PMing me for an invite to rbetateam we dont have any active betas right now and the next one we hold will have the same optin model as this one Good job on the new feature guys but when are you going to fix search For once i saw the internet keep a secret Congrats Boolean operators are a go AND OR and NOT Note that combining AND and OR requires you to use parenthesis to fix order of operations So far these are the filters you can use  redditsubreddit  filters by subreddit  authorusername  filters by author  urldomain  include only results from specified domain  selftexttext  searches for text in text post contents  isselfyesno  filters by self posts only  overyesno  include NSFW subreddits only in results Try them out One of my favorites is username NOT authorusername This shows you posts that have your username but not made by you So check if people were talking about you Edit FAQ here  httpwwwredditcomhelpsearch deleted WTF My search actually returned results THIS REDDIT IS NOT MY REDDIT seriously good job with the new search I searched for search and this thread was the top result II really dont know how to react to a search that works First they took our jokes about Reddit GoldhttpiimgurcomZUOUMjpg Now we cant complain anymore about the searchhttpiimgurcomIqrjpg Guys you are ruining Reddit by taking away all its imperfectionshttpiimgurcomSpVZjpg Fantastic This feature is solid gold Mother of godhttpimgurcomYNw is the world ending Im scared Makes sense I did a search yesterday and i found exactly what i wanted Amazing and nice outsourcing work P I wonder what people will find about this to bitch about now This is an amazing update though You guys at the reddit HQ are awesome I cant believe the search finally works haha When I get home from work I think I will be buying a subscription to reddit gold  rsearchhttpredditcomrsearch seams to be forbidden right now But its not even  yet deleted Glad to be a part of the rbetateam Hope that you like the new search it has been hard to keep it a secret when all of Reddit is bitching about Reddit Gold and non functional search Big props to the admins for implementing this betateam for testing and props to reddit gold for helping fund this Google is still better because it can search within the comments Also it seems like there is a bug when you search a second time with a different search string the results stay the same deleted And thus dawns a new era Yeah but when will you finally fix the search function Reddits search is fixed What will I complain about now Works great btw deleted Wait What just like that But but No we cant complain anymore  THIS SEARCH IS SLOWhttpiimgurcomvMPxvpng Would you have been able to fix the search without Reddit gold money You should set rbetateam to public so the public can see us laughing at people complaining about search Tomorrows top submission the search works too well FIX IT Pop the champagne What will the hivemind complain about now Hivemind explodes Missed opportunity maybe Outsource the search to Google in exchange for Google Ads How much are Flaptor charging And all because of Reddit Gold Im a big guy named Vinnie and I would gladly destroy anyone who makes search sucks posts for you for free Reddit Though an enforcer trophy would be pretty badass I am a reddit user and what is this SEARCH SUCKS No but seriously the difference in results between the beta search trials and the standard reddit search were phenomenal Good work Thethe search Fixed Something    something strange has happened Im afraid Lucene is awesome Good choice HELL HATH FROZEN OVER Is Reddit paying Flaptor for this search product If so how much Are you still open to other search solutions if it means you can get it for free or even make money from it assuming that the search is of the same quality as what Flaptor is offering and that you dont have to spend additional resources developingtesting it From the old Search FAQhttpwwwredditcomhelpsearch  If you work at Google or a Google competitor convince your superiors that our data is worth having and that they should host our search for free If they do well give them a realtime feed of our data so they can see what topics are trending right now When the Lamb broke the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and seven trumpets were given to them Another angel came and stood at the altar holding a golden censer and much incense was given to him so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints went up before God out of the angels hand Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and threw it to the earth and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them you guys should just have an advanced search section so I can do all the complex searches without knowing all the codes I just have to say in light of the negativity lately and then the deliverance of an awesome search tool  Thank you Reddit All I have to say is THANK YOU I did a search for Ladybugs and got  links within  seconds Sweet Wow excellent Id given up on the old search engine Thanks guys  I want to beta test Thanks for giving us Reddit Gold at least we still have something to whine about I searched for something this morning and the results didnt suck I thought I just got really lucky or something THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING The important question now is Will it blend omfg its the apocalypse The code was really kinky snicker I am not twelve years old May I suggest a link to the search lucene search syntax below the search box kind of like the formating help link beneath the comment box Hate to rain on the parade here but while the search is better it still needs work I took  front page stories and searched for them as if I had seen them a couple days ago and wanted to find them again Reddit search failed to include the right results or any results Google turned up the news story at the top of the list each time using the exact same search I used here     Its so fun searching and having things actually come up Made possible by your generous donations heheh It is the end of an era wow  I think I can actually get rid of the greasemonkey script that makes the search reddit bar a google search for siteredditcom Your reddit gold tax dollars at work This has convinced me to get reddit gold Yet you only have paypal as a payment option Grr Flaptor Sounds like fapping raptor I dont trust raptors let alone fapping raptors Im as giddy as a  lb man set loose in a Hostess twinkie factory This search is NOW DIAMONDS No seriously though you should have done this  years ago p Better late than never I guess Subsequent search sucks selfposts will just become about comments not getting indexed lack of stemming and the need for all the searched terms to be present in the title Will all the gold haters finally shut up now this  gold is a brilliantlycalculated move removing the primary source of redditangst and replacing it with something else maybe the admins are not so out of touch with their user base WHy doe sit still not work i searched test post and got nothing Im still not paying Oh my god this MUST be a Reddit Gold feature RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE sarcasm And thus ends the days of darkness  points  like it Well god damn I guess that  percent thing is just an urban legend thanks assholes now what am I going to complain about I know this will never be read by anyone other than myself But YES Consequences will truly never be the same I found a submission I have been trying to find for over a year Thank you Reddit This is a perfect example of why Reddit cant afford to pay for additional engineers Waste money on a new search engine when you could just use Google Youre as bad as the US government So at what point will all the people who have been screaming bloody murder that reddit and the admins are orchestrating an evil plot to destroy reddit and never give any features to the Great Unwashed Masses that arent goldmembers retract any part of their hysterical rants Search was THE most requested fix on reddit as far as I can tell Thanks for improving it Didnt it always support Lucene syntax AFAIK in most antiredditsearch threads some calm voice of reason will always mention Did you try Lucene syntax Thanks The search for furries returned  results  I liked it better when search was broken Good I still have something to complain about No way I must be dreaming Searched for chan nothing came up In other news hell has finally frozen over and the four horsemen of the apocalypse have just broken through international airspace OMG It workshttpwwwredditcomrannouncementssearchqnewsearch And of course now that its working I have nothing to search for Wait so now if I search for something Ill actually find it You broke reddit I hope this will happen someday BREAKING Google buys reddit I know a lot of you folks will disagree and we will have more ads but no more slow server problems and no more search problems if this is successful there are going to be a lot of people that have to pay up something they owed when the search function works Awesome  Its working great Im just relieved this isnt a Reddit Gold feature  satisfied click yes I think this post could break the record for percentage of people who like it Yup its working  httpwwwredditcomsearchqbuttseckshttpwwwredditcomsearchqbuttsecks But the real question is will this post be liked by  of reddit Me  trying the search  actually working  speechless Can someone answer why reddit search and reddit in general works perfectly when you are not logged in All my search results work instantly and pages load very fast logged out but logged in it is standstill Hm thats oddhttpwwwredditcomrannouncementssearchqsearchsucks At first I read the labels and thought it was part of the post I thought  Labels can it find my pants was some bizarre sales pitch for it I guess reddit search will never be able to find my pants it still sucks  it gives no result for minimal pokemon only minimalist pokemon why cant it read part of words  Theres no way this will work better than the old search Would you ever consider extending this to work with comments Im getting uneasy Whats next Duke Nukem Forever tomorrow Finally Took them long enough Sometimes I think Im the only person who knew how to hax the old search Maybe its just the things I was looking for but I have never failed to find what I wanted using it Specifically search the subreddit usually fiarly easy to rememberguess if youre looking for something you saw previously and sort by new Well improved search can only be better though well have to see how this turns out when I next need to search for something state of the art AND OR NOT searches MY TIME MACHINE FINALLY WORKED ITS  Jk problem You mad Okay troll Can we look forward to a technical post about some of the details of how this works or is that complicated it being outsourced to IndexTank Figure out not to use python on AWS yet  Holy crap reddit just helped me find a lot of information in relation with something Ive been researching I love you bear hug I cant believe it actually works Thought it said Faptor Fool me seven times shame on you Fool me eight or more times shame on me Holy shit I just searched suicide and the top hit was the relevant recentlyfrontpage link My willys up Omg just an hour ago I was searching for Charles the cat who never had a bad day in his life The page I wanted was the top result And I was like whoa its all so clear to me now What about search suggestions First thing I did was go to IAmA and search for brother OR sister Works as advertised Im curious whether GSAhttpwwwgooglecomenterprisesearchgsahtml was considered before the decision to use Flaptor was ultimately made I told you all I wasnt going to be useless my whole life You didnt believe in me I now wait for your apologies Awesome now maybe you could help them out a bit by implementing tags  While Im sure the new search engine is great I sure hope SearchRedditcom stays live for those search puzzles that only some wellhoned googlefu can solve Can one of our greasemonkeys make a script to take advantage of the various operators I wish it searched comments though Guess ill stick to google for that so I might as well use google for all my searching Perhaps reddit should use a custom google search minus googles ads When will there be an ability to search pms and comments in threads Ive participated in I want to find a comment someone left me about a year ago and dont fancy clicking through my comment history to find it Its about fucking time I love the speed That shit works a shit ton better than that other shitty shit Right on This feels like when your parents get you an awesome present for your birthday after keeping it a secret for so long Is this the end for TOMT Stay tuned to find out on next weeks episode of Reddit well this would have saved me one frustrating hour last night why not just wire up google to search using siteredditcom term Why dont they just integrate Google search A lot of sites do it Holy crap This is the first time search has ever worked for me Do you think Flaptor is paying reddit Also why didnt reddit outsource the search to Google Turning the fight against these bills into another social media phenomenon sounds like a good idea to me Well here we are again We knew it was coming but most of did not suspect it would come so soon It hasnt even been five months since the worldwide PIPA  SOPA protests and Congress is back to playing its standard game of slashing and burning what we hold most important for the sake of their personal agendas The bills of PIPA  SOPA are effectively dead but their text is being broken up into pieces and has been put into other bills and what they represent lives on I do not want to alarm you the person reading thing but you should starring long and hard at what is going on right now We are on the precipice of something horrible happening and if we do not fight again we will lose horribly and our personal freedoms will be maimed and impacted far beyond what we can see as the initial impact As of today this is where we stand  SOPA The Stop Online Piracy Act is effectively dead

 EFF Four Unanswered Questions About the Cybersecurity Billshttpswwwefforgdeeplinksfourunansweredquestionsaboutcybersecuritybills  Comparing the Senate Cybersecurity Liability Provisionshttpwwwlawfareblogcomcomparingthesenatecybersecurityliabilityprovisions As it stands now days after the House of Representatives passed CISPA we are poised with the questions of Who what where and why While many of the answers to those questions can be found in the links posted above the biggest reason as to why major companies like Google Facebook and even reddit have not spoken out vehemently against these bills is simple They actually stand to benefit from them in some ways CISPA was crafted from the ground up with the help of some of these very major tech companies and the NSA so the debacle of SOPA  PIPA wouldnt happen again Instead of having to fight against companies and their users they now just have to worry about your average joe getting upset Doing this paints a much smaller target on the bill and makes it that much more challenging for us to prevent the abuses that are poised to come from CISPA and the additional cybersecurity bills Many are calling for blackouts again but unfortunately Congress is trying a new and incredibly effective strategy this time They are dividing us from the companies that assisted us last time In the language of CISPA it has been found cut and dry that most companies will be given immunity from what goes on within their enterprises so long as they hand over your information en mass This means that your user profile your personal information your comment history the websites you link to and even possibly what you like of Facebook and similar websites will be handed over to the government To make matters even worse the government will essentially bribe these companies by paying them to hand over the data Congress did something cunningly smart they made it so the only allies the common user has are themselves Reddit INC as a company has no good reason to speak up loudly in support like they did with PIPA  SOPA The reason is that they actually come to benefit from CISPA rExplainItLikeImFive puts it nicely Basically it allows companies to provide the federal government with data concerning cybersecurity threats without liability Currently most large websites have a Privacy Policy which normally states that companies will not voluntarily share your data If they did share your data then you could likely successfully sue them CISPA protects companies from lawsuits if they share data concerning cybersecurity threats with the federal government So companies like Facebook and Google tend to like the bill because it shields them from liabilityhttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentssujsuwhatiscispa We must not we cannot allow these companies to ever believe that that selling out the user and throwing them under the bus can be part of their business model It must be a concrete inseparable fact that our interests are the companies interest You and I stood up and fought in the ways that we could to protect these companies like Google Facebook even Reddit INC from PIPA  SOPA They need to do their damnedest to do the same for us The ridiculously overused saying by pastor Martin Niemller best fits here First they came for the communists and I didnt speak out because I wasnt a communist Then they came for the trade unionists and I didnt speak out because I wasnt a trade unionist Then they came for the Jews and I didnt speak out because I wasnt a Jew Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me There is a part two to this There wont be anymore inspiring quotes eitherhttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentssxdxvaquicknoteoncispaandrelatedbillschsv Black outs will not continue to work guys They continually lose their effectiveness every time you do them There are  fucking bills being considered right now for internet censorship do you really think that Google and Wikipedia are going to shut down their shit that many times and who knows how many in the future Or are we naive enough to think that just blacking out Reddit will make a difference We need these people out of office and need to spread awareness that this is not ok There are initiatives all across the board for doing so and supporting them and getting involved is our best shot EDIT some awesome information on CISPA and the upcoming bills and what you can do to help in addition to AlexanderXBlakes information HERE IT IS Infohttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentssxdxvaquicknoteoncispaandrelatedbillschse What if we created a Reddit Super PAC with the sole purpose being to combat these internet security bills Theres a lot of us I bet we can get some big donations and make some good TV campaigns And since we cant all agree on just about any other political issue well put it in the organizations founding documents that this is the only thing it can spend funds on Thoughts  CALL YOUR SENATORS let them know that you will not vote for them again if they support this if they get enough callsemails they wont vote for it  GET THE INFORMATION OUT THERE get to the papers talk to your friends post shit on facebook get StopCISPA trending whatever the main reason the blackout was so effective was because all of the attention that googlewikipedia brought to it caused people to become aware of the issue if the public knows this shit will not go down  BOYCOTT COMPANIES THAT SUPPORT IT httpwwwdigitaltrendscomwebcispasupporterslistcompaniesthatcouldhelpunclesamsnagyourdata heres a list this ones a lot harder but if we all do it we can change everything im not saying you need to change your cable company or cell phone plan but tackle things that can be attacked easily for example dont go on google or yahoo if you can avoid it use another search engine like ask for a while dont use your visa card dont go to walmart or target dont drink coke or pepsi let these companies know we dont support their stances by hitting their wallets like i said it wont be easy but it will work guaranteed I DISAGREE  Regarding not Blacking out Here is why A They keep coming with the same attacks just written differently every time we must do the same The blackout brings a gigantic black open enrollment form for all of the internet who has no idea regarding CISPA or related bills very effective Although I will agree they lose their effectiveness over time this method is still and has been in the past an amazing attribute that we have created within B We need to gather as a community outside of these wires and circuits We need to hit the streets Remember that retarded KONY  Thing DO you realize how effective that was We need to revamp the idea and start a creation of our own vimeo videos a day to repeal meetings and hit the fucking streets C News Who are reddits allies Websites Talk Show Hosts The Huff Post or Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert NO matter what it is we need to either have the admins contact them and work something out or we need to continue to multiply emails to these people and have them work with us This costs us nothing but our time the time we are choosing how to live it Lets not stop D Can we form Donations Billboards commercials whatever we have to do to gain exposure Erfiarfia Free Internet Activism  Everyone should at the minimum glance this page F AdminsSomeone ImportantPotatoinmyanus Please create an askreddit topic to figure out where and how we should start first and make this hit the front page If I were to create it I feel as if It would not get proper exposure we are the most powerful internet group out their let us know how we can agree to come together Adding on to this list or critiques are encouraged This is where we need to start moving and if youre waiting you need to realize quickly we have no time to wait or spare the time to act is now EDITS  Grammar  DOSKO  Pointed out Reddit has a PAC  Wormy and OLawD has pointed to rFIArFIA Which we need to all educate on  KEEP ADDING This list needs to be severely populated with our intelligent witty creative and effective ideas let us display and implement them It seems like we should have a rbillReview subreddit that actually automatically posts each bill that is up for voting and have a group of people who are able to summarize it Are all bills that are up for a vote automatically posted on a gov web site Is there an API that would allow us to automate posting a new topic when a new bill comes up with a copy of the bill for reference Ok so what are you going to do This sounds like a lot of verbiage with no real meaning but your voice is the one that matters here Very much sounds like youre saying youre on your own for this one You made it your own mission to get the word out about SOPA making the announcement that you did and doing the blackout saying it was all about protecting freedoms but now youre letting this one slide It sounds like youre just trying to placate uspoorly EDIT Admittedly CISPA has only just been hitting the frontpage in the past week and brainstorming with the community is a good idea But I am wary of the tone of this post which is too vague and almost makes it sound like Reddit is trying to shirk responsibility Arent these billslegislation like cispasopa etc just going to be never ending in the future until the big lobbying companies get there own way Cynical but realistic attitude until major changes are made with the leaders of this world Im afraid doing the exact same thing again will seem kind of lame in comparison E E E Everyone grab a pitchfork Here goes The community as a whole is framing this argument wrong CISPA is simultaneously undermining your right to control information about yourself while increasing corporations and governments ability to control information about their operations The concepts of intellectual property and privacy are entangled and by being reactive instead of proactive were sacrificing liberty so that corporations thrive The primary purpose behind the design and implementation of the internet was to increase the efficiency of scientific research and development It is built around the value of collaboration allowing individuals access to facts and theories so that they can advance the rate of human creativity We should be writing legislation demanding more transparency of the corporations who are utilizing a government project to increase their profits instead of focusing on hitting back when they try to undermine our liberties Human beings have a right to privacy Corporations have no such right Intellectual property rights choke off creativity and productivity for the sake of constricting the number of people who profit from an idea Yes creators deserve to be rewarded fro the production of content but hiding the scientific principles surrounding a new technology or burying studies that call into question the value of a product are both slowing the rate of human advancement Im not saying to stop defending the right to control your personal information but we need to create a threat to the powerbase of the people attacking us or its just going to keep happening over and over Intellectual property protection that extends beyond the lifetime the inventor is insane We need to stop thinking in the paradigm of the old guard and start breaking new ground otherwise we WILL lose the war We did so well on SOPA lets not fall short this time Here are my thoughts   Until they do go away has anyone written an application for smart phones that can alert someone about this sort of thing The last thing it needs to do is spam me with messages but I feel that if people could receive a warning when this shit was about to go down we could mobilize faster  I barely knew a damn thing about CISPA Has anyone or can anyone put together a concise explanation of what CISPA is and can someone perhaps make an animation of it I literally do not know how to do any of these things but the hivemind does and I think thats what makes us strong as a community Im honestly not sure what to do offensively for the time being But one thing has been clear and its that these attacks are not going away After we defeat CISPA we need to have a serious conversation about what kind of legislation we need to pass to go on the offensive Heres an idea Lets all email howard stern about CISPA Sirius just fucked him out of  million dollars So even if they support CISPA he wont give a shit If enough of us email him I am sure he will mention it on air Thats MILLION newly informed people instantly You know how much Howard hates the FCC because they monitored every word he said How is this different Here is the link to email him on his site We can do this httpwwwhowardsterncomcontacths I for one want to say thank you for this post Although it is short it is good to know that the momentum is building over the weekend and I look forward to increased discussion and activity of this going into next week Reddit can be a powerful force when it is focused and I want to prove everyone wrong who says that we could only be tapped once to stop SOPA Nice one Reddit Im gonna try and do something Maybe Ill make a protest pizza Does this mean the protest is off  puts pitchfork down I hope Stop CISPA catches on like Kony  did then something might actually happen I think the SOPA blackouts worked well to inform people who would otherwise be ignorant to the situation as well as encourage people to contact their senatorsrepresentatives Id like to try and organize something similar to raise awareness for CISPA Dudes I need likeone sentence that sums up your views Aka a teal dear Im drunk Most of us are higher than kites Cmon now It wont be a free private open internet with CISPA With the threat of there being no internet anonymity some might argue that free discussions on places such as reddit would no longer exist I certainly wouldnt feel comfortable posting many things on here in askreddit iama or even some of more nsfw threads knowing someday it could be pulled up and pointed to by the government as proof of who knows what I understand how that might help in some cases but really Reddit really needs to realize this Maybe Im just not that addicted to Reddit but if CISPA truly passes I will have to quit this site among others and Im sure I cant be the only one Maybe Im just paranoid but whatever Plenty of generations before us lived with just books and later TV and it might be a nice return to actually going outdoors and a real break from the internet The solution ultimately is complete civil disobedience Congress does not have the best interests of even a small majority of Americans at heart They are betraying us in every way possible and will continue to build newer more invasive control mechanisms no matter what we do Until we rebel and tell them to go to hell NOVEMBERhttpmediatumblrcomtumblrmRBXRreojpg Remember this in November  dont stand idly by while they pillage our rights Its not that hard  MAKE them know that we wont take their shit any longer Sorry guys but to be blunt I really cared about SOPA and PIPA I was very vocal about it CISPA has made it obvious our elected officials dont give a flying fuck about us The best way to fight this one is just vote them out of office Theres no way to win with this individual bill But write and call your congressmen and Senators and explain why you will not be voting for them My local congressman walks through my town every year right past my front door during our parade Theyll be getting some boos from me and my friends this year Help an elected official that DOES care about our rights run for office Donate to their campaign Help raise awareness about them This is the only way we can actually stop this Because its been made obvious that what we did to SOPA was just a roadblock Once they see the whole highway is down only then will things change Am I the only one who read this and found it to be a series of meaningless platitudes without out taking any sort of stance Thishttpwwwredditcomrfia To send a signal to Congress that these kinds of legislative initiatives must stop there are two ways  that will help prevent this from happening  vote the people who vote for this kind of legislation out of office and vote for people who wont vote for that kind of legislation by far the much preferred way  destroy the people who vote for this kind of legislation If nothing else works Make sure you stop by rCISPArCISPA for more info and to ask any questions We could use more readers As a non American my first reaction is Why should I care Then I remembered an argument made by a fellow countrymen regarding etolling in my province If it works there the USA it will start to appear closer to home wherever you live Bad ideas should be stopped before they are spread by bad people In South Africas most economic active province Gauteng the government decided to upgrade the intercity and urban highways the province is about km x km in size This is a good thing but later on with terrible communication to the public they decided to errect drive through toll gantries To the public the documents and information were either censored or jumbled But the information it did give was that the average worker will pay a lot more to get to work The cost of of living would also increase significantly harming the poor The tolling system would be extremely innefecient at about  admin cost but it also came to light that a lot of backers and investors in the system will coin it big time So a cheaper alternitive to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrade would be to increase the fuel levy People in other provinces and cities said this is unfair since they would have to pay The argument against this was twofold First if the system is succesfull it would start popping up in other urban centres within a couple of years And second the Gautng province only keeps  of the money it generates in the province The rest is used to fund other provinces either by taxes or by profits from external companies or by workers sending money to their outer province families So the argument is weak My point being if a bad idea works there it is a matter of time before it wil raise its ugly head here CISPA is harmless I completely believe every single breath coming out of Michael Rogers We dont REALLY need privacy on the internet what we need is for the government to take copies of everything we do on the internet Americans and scrutinize it Then they need to prosecute all people who chews Laffy Taffy jerks with there LEFT hand shaves only half their balls to surprise the girlfriend scratches their balls and sniffs it puts mayo on hash browns and accidentally visiting a jihad website There comes a point when you realize fighting this one bill isnt the issue when there or  similar bills waiting to take its place if this one isnt passed and that the bigger problem is a Congress that has a  approval rating and no longer gives a shit about their ratings or the people The real problem is a Congress making decisions based not on the needs of the people but on what corporations want and what would best line up their pockets So in other words the real problem is a fundamental flaw in the way this government is being chosen and run I think I realized that the US Congress was a joke when they spent millions of tax payers money on investigating steroid use in baseball during a failing economy failing wars in Iraq failing health care and a host of other real problems Everyone always says vote the bums out just not our bum Well our bum is the only one we have a vote on To fix this and several other problems it may be necessary for a few babies to go out with the bathwater though not many for Washington to realize that we can have a voice in the elections Who are your representatives and how did they vote on this and other bills When are they up for reelection Do YOU know can I just point out that having a blackout isnt going to solve anything look at SOPA for example it just killed SOPA and they made a bigger bill we need to take out the root of the problem This is a classic nonanswer answer It attempts to paint a picture like we care and your voice is important by responding in a timely fashion but without substance in fact it even begins to couch the inevitable answer which you will receive by using terms like anger and confusion about CISPA so when they say it really isnt that bad you might believe them Ive said it for months The internet went full retard on SOPA and now privacy will be destroyed Tech corporations had wildly divergent interests in countering SOPA but none of them were the reasons people in general cared about they were all acting in their own self interest with profit in mind except Wikipedia they were pretty good Anyway now youre all fucked and the costs will be offloaded to the consumer Have fun

battle considering the corporate support behind CISPA If anything we need more involvement from the community this time around to compensate We must fight if we roll over and let this go all our fighting we did against SOPAACTA will be for nothing We could all support the opponents of the people who voted for it in the next election With such a large and devoted following Reddit could be a very good interest group for the protection of internet freedom Reddit admins at our backs makes me feel pretty good We need to be proactive Gather legal experts and the common knowledge of redditors to draft legislation that protects the Internets freedom anonymity and neutrality and submit it to our legislators Callingwriting legislators to let them know we will not stand for this shit also helps Thats the reddit that were proud to be a part of and its our responsibility as citizens and a community to identify rally against and take action against legislation that impacts our internet freedoms Thats a good idea i think we need to put signs up and spread the word through social networking sites Support the EFF Best advice I can give at this moment  without turning into a crappy unprepared rant whilst on an iPhone how about funding a lobby that would work fulltime in DC and educate the legislators about these cyber issues  it could be staffed with individuals who have experience in IT and a passion for activism Reddit has shown some deep pockets in the past I bet we could make something work I am happy to do an IAMA I think the blackouts were powerful before but didnt really negatively influence everyday people enough to make them consider the future under what is being short sightedly considered Reddit doesnt just have an Opportunity we have a Responsibility A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history Mahatma Gandhi Are there any bills that open the internet rather than close it so that we can affirm a free and private internet rather than constantly fighting off closures I would much rather be for something than continually fending off an unending stream of noxious bills Turning it into a media phenomenon is the best idea for the time being However we need to make it EASIER for everyone to KNOW who to VOTE for and HOW to vote If we made it possible for everyone to vote from their computer even the laziest redditor will have hisher voice heard I believe that the problem really stems from the lack of voting participation and general knowledge about the political field I think there needs to be an act for internet freedom I believe there was a post about it before and I believe it is completely necessary Because the United Staes have passed a bill it will affect the word I live in Australia and it will definitely affect me as well Its just not fair You know what I think we should do I think we should write our own bill that will attempt to please both parties Or send a proposal that would meet in the middle of both views My concern was when everyone came together to fight SOPA was that the internet excuse this expression shot its collective wad I was afraid that all they have to do is keep coming up with Bills like it and people would eventually get tired of fighting them Im worried that this is whats happening now CISPA is worse than SOPA in its own way but its not getting the publicity that SOPA  PIPA got I wish I was wrong about this but people have short attention spans We won the battle but will eventually lose the war I hate to be a pessimist but all its going take is for them to just keep writing these kinds of Bills and eventually people wont care enough to even speak out at least in the numbers its going to take to stop it Im not going to give up but we wont have internet blackout protests every time one of the Bills comes along The only thing that will slow them down is if we dont vote for the makers of such Bills and they lose their seats in government This might serve as a warning Maybe we could make up some kind of list of the supporters and show how many have lost their seats after an election Make it public enough that the politicians see people them losing votes because of their support Forgive my ignorance but how likely is CISPA to actually pass through in the Senate Crazystupid legislation is passed by the House all the time only to die a messy death in the Senateand Obama has publicly said hed veto the shit outta CISPA if it makes his desk So we stop SOPA then we stop CISPA then we stop the next thing its so futile Those who dont get the Internet just dont get it and feel threatened by it They react by trying to control it  and the best we can do to react is to keep living free  All we need to do is make CISPA famous and coordinate a secret postering night I say we call itCISPA Thoughts YEAH IMPACT Lets pull a KONY Agree on a date elect a graphic artist to create an image and well all print it out and glue it to buildings Fight fire with fire Or is this mayhaps water Im talking about Is there anything akin to something like a EFF subreddit where just things of this nature get discussed The Online Primary Caucus TOPC Reddit is comprised of liberals freethinkers libertarians pro science agenda caffeinated media influencers So on a date near the primaries   get the online privacy redditors create IRCsvote mechanismmessage boards with some mechanism for controlling bots One site per congressional district   People attend the IRC chat site and vote they select a district leader a Coalition member to act as point person and a candidate to represent them in the fall Vote on a list of agenda items   These winners  the district leaders and their agenda percolate up and we have an online vote perhaps a week later to allow people to digest   Everyone vows to vote for the Coalition on election day Year One goals  SOPA CISPA supporters at risk Year Three goals Congress realizes they must address the Coalition every election EDIT modified to IRCsVote MechanismMessage boards with some mechanism for controlling bots Email your senators and let them know how serious this is This bill is not a joke and the repercussions of it passing would be devastating Dont WAIT to do this Write them now Dont let this kind of crap come to Canada kill it now before it spreads The only hope we have is to slam through bills forbidding prospective candidates from accepting money from corporate sources If a candidate can be found to have accepted so much as a stick of gum or a light for his cigarette from a corporate lobbyist theyre immediately disqualified If a sitting congressman is found to have done so theyre expelled Until then the corporations are eventually going to win every fight like thisthey can make themselves much more of a threat to a congressmans reelection than we can The only problem is that at this point most of our congressmen would sooner resign than vote yes on such a bill Its the mentality that underlies all of SOPA PIPA and CISPA that needs to be fought These bills cant be entirely dealt with one at a time  theyll continue to be rehashed again and again We need a much broader discussion about internet privacy and rights So basically your position is one where Reddit Inc does nothing Great DO THE SAME THING YOU DID FOR SOPA SHUT DOWN REDDIT THIS IS A NO BRAINER AND YOU SHOULDNT BE CONSULTING US JUST DO IT Boycott all of thesehttpintelligencehousegovhrletterssupport companies if you can They will keep coming back unless we can hit them where it hurts As someone who has done very little research on CISPA and whatever other scary proposed legislation is currently threatening our internet freedom I can say that it will be difficult to get people to care about it like we did with SOPA I was well informed during that debacle SOPAPIPA and I spread the information to everyone I could but that almost makes CISPA seem even more insurmountable I know this probably isnt the case but to the average internet user it almost feels hopeless Like no matter what we oppose the government will just come up with a new scarier bill with a new name I guess Im saying its going to be hard to get people to rally against CISPA like we did with SOPA because it feels like we already fought so hard against it to no avail Whos behind it Do we know Lets find out and vote them out of office Seriously who the fuck brings these bills always up for legislation We need to point out who are the legislators and label them as peeping toms As soon as we make the connection that these people are essentially perverts the tide will turn against them People are more concerned with uploading pics and checking in to FB I try to explain why this bill is so fucking important and cue blank stares Americans dont give a damn until its too late in this country and then roll over and whimper I certainly appreciate hearing this from Reddit and I think its pretty awesome However there is something that has bothered me for quite some time and I feel its relevant to get out here on this thread SOPA PIPA ACTA and now CISPA are all bills well worthy of rallying against However there are so many things passed over the past year that shouldve been aggressively opposed as much so as these cyber security bills and probably more so My issue why is that sites like Reddit and Google will chomp at the bit to trash these kind of bills that could affect our freedom on the internet but I never see them rally support against things like NDAA and NDRP The internet is certainly a worthy cause but the assault on our liberty and freedom is coming from all angles now We should be taking a stand against these things as well We have proven how powerful the internet really is so why dont we use it to protect freedoms outside the internet and fight government on betrayal of ALL of our liberties and rights not just the internet Or could it be that even those that we feel are fighting along side us have no interest unless directly threatens their livelihood and revenue I strongly feel this is the case Our power is in numbers and we access the greatest numbers via the internet NDAA and NDRP were pretty much in a spotlight on Reddit but no action was taken Lets change that and restore America now not rebuild it after its too late I think this is Reddit telling us that were alone on this one guys perhaps we should purpose laws that protect internet liberties instead of fighting laws that try to take such liberties from us What other online comumities are opposing It would be interesting to find a way to network on these issues what can we do reddit Lets form a Reddit lobby REDDIT BANNER HAVE YOU CALLED YOUR SENATOR YET What about servers located in countries more interested in privacy and the commnuity runs a notforprofit VPN service so your ISP doesnt know shit Google your state senators and state representatives and tell them you dont want the government to be a cyberbully or big bother Fucking Wikibill man Lets wiki up a bill to protect the internet Just need to think of an overly long acronym first Like HIVEMIND We dont need a quick note we need anger and action seeing as how CISPA went through the house on the th this response may just be too little too late as i said before the USA is becoming a police state or rather a state like big brother from  first they will flout the laws of your land then comes freedom of speech soon there will be drones going around cameras everywhere and in the end a police force who will raid anyone without a warrent check back in  to  years if you are lucky enough to be on the net and say what has happened with new tech quantum computers and nano robots you can spy on anyone you wish and save everyones email anything good luck from Britain we will see it sooner theyve already shown us theyre more than willing to go through the bureaucracy and order a few pages to draw up the paperwork as many times as they need to we have to show them were willing to protest it each and every time theyre assuming well lose interest or give up sooner than they will and judging by the lack of sufficient outrage it seems we have already Things like this should have internet lovers anywhere concerned Distributed peer to peer networks with free and open software should be made and used Im not US citizen and  I hate to be cynical but reddit puts this little letter up after all the outpouring against this Yet they have ignored everything posted so far and just seem to be trying to water down the situation and make sure not too many people participate in the boycott And you know the worst part It will work This bill will pass Obama wont veto and the corporations will win again So have fun with your glimmer of hope that this admin posted I for one will be realistic Besides resisting legislation the most important thing Reddit could do is innovate technology to make it hard for something like CISPA to stick Make Reddit  Decentralized  Encrypted This may sound like a throwback to NNTP and IRC but why not rebuild Reddit as a network of independent servers distributed throughout the world These days corporate software can have a substantial open source component with feet in both worlds Why cant a corporate social networking site have one foot firmly planted in technologies that radically protect the privacy of its users The only thing that will stop these laws are technologies that make enforcement so costly as to be nearly impossible what if we all signed a letter to Pres Obama letting him know that OKing CISPA would be an inexcusable offense and we would not vote him back into office this seems like a fairly direct solution no That doesnt answer the question about why SOPA it was such anassertive response from reddit whereas CISPA is we got your back guys The land of the free sure does seem to like censoring things I know its been said in here multiple times but we are many in numbers We can all contact our senators and let them know this is a horrible act If ten or twenty do it fine If  do it they begin to notice  They begin to sweat  you get the idea Whether they listen to us is another thing but what they need to realize is that we arent going to give up on this Free open communication and the use of this powerful tool is much more than a room full of out of touch wealthy people that were elected to listen to our requests to make a better society and ultimately a better world Our next step and this is where I may lose some of you is electoral reform This cannot continue and if you wish to improve this joke of a political system that was once so great you must get involved The internet reddit particularly is famous for activism that takes a couple clicks You want change Fight for it Im not talking about violence it should never come to that Work to change your political system get involved on a local level with the candidates running for Senate positions Ive informed one of my Senators McCain RAZ that due to his work on the NDAA I will no longer to continue to support him and I will spread the word Most people dont even know that NDAA passed let alone the verbage of this constitutionallyraping bill of rightsshitting on piece of garbage That brings us to Mr Puppet himself The presidential elections The third phase must bring back the vote to the majority not the minorty The USAs electoral college is a sham and a travesty to something that most people would jump run swim sign sell their souls to be a part of Democracy and the Freedom that goes along with it Immigrants both legal and illegal come to our country to experience the freedoms America has to offer and yet we cant control our own political system Its not that this is something new its been happening for a long time we just know more about it thanks towait for ityou guessed it the INTERNET All of this is rooted in fear Fear of power of information Fear of a bunch of people banding together to fight back as is welcomed and understood in the American Constitution written by our forefathers This fear is visible by those who are elected by their constitutency They receive handouts from lobbyists and can reword a need to tighten watch over piracy in the name of job loss I know this is from SOPA but its still true with CISPA Look at the Occupy Movement In its infancy the movement was hard to track plans were hard to follow if you werent in the know This was because TPTB couldnt figure out how information was being passed Much like the tactics of the Arab Spring the people could stand and pass information looking as innocent as checking a sports score or reading the news Thenthey caught on As they started to crack down on Twitter Facebook Youtube getting sites to censor pull down or delete material completely theyve begun to learn Clever girl They realize that the delay comes from them and have learned our weaknessCSPAN Not many of us watch it and Id be curious to find out how many American redditors understand the actual passing of a bill into law in the USA Immigrants who pass our citizenship test know more about our processes than we do We have been lulled into a sense of security by products and our lazy way of life We cannot allow generation after generation to slip into ignorance of this If there are any high school redditors on here Im curious as to how much time is spent on the structure of government its process and current affairs To sum up knowledge is key and for the love of dog contact your senators Jam the phones write emails write letters send postcards with the Mr Yuk facesomething anything with the whole kony back lash it seems as though the internet has lost faith in it self people should be much louder about this bill then we have been I dont buy this announcement Its great to see a unified front Keep spreading the word everybody Lets win again Time to elect some young officials fellas Someone with the requisite skills could probably whip up a website that lists all the congressman that support the bill those of whom formerly decried the SOPA legislation and their financial contributors by industry and also explains the new legislation Why doesnt reddit make a PAC Butbut Go daddy Wouldnt it be awesome if the word reddit became synonymous with the crowdsourcing of online freedom in addition to a place where animals give advice Theres an Android app called simply Congress It gives you all the information about who represents you how they vote and bills that are before the House and Senate I have no affiliation with whoever makes it but its a great information tool IMHO What does increased velocity for the frontpage algorithm mean Could you guys fix how Google puts mredditcom links in desktop results Not sure if its something that can be fixed but its annoying nonetheless uspez Yesterday rAskHistorians was approached about being part of the AB testing for this new subreddit suggestion system you are planning for mobile and told that it might drive some new traffic to your subreddit We also were told to let us know if you have any questions or see any problems Well to be frank we do have questions and we do see problems but when we responded stressing rAskHistorians wellknown opposition to default status and asking for more information about what this new system looked like we were told Im trying to get the right answers for you but havent tracked anyone down yet However I do know that this is a topic that uspez will be covering in his AMA in rannouncements tomorrow morning at least in regards to the way defaults work currently and what were looking at for the future Unfortunately this answer leaves us without any further information So uspez could you please provide us with more information about what inclusion in the AB test entails what the long term plan is and whether subreddits will be able to opt out or otherwise control how they are included Regards Zhukov and the AH Mod Team From what I understand reddit lost its primary API developer about a year ago and since then it seems like all API improvements and work has been very minimal I understand that you guys are shifting priority to your own mobile app and mobile site but can you please look into making sure that the API isnt let to go stale For example with the new modmail system thats coming down the road please please give us new modmail endpoints to reflect these new capabilities Not only is this important to thirdparty app developers but its also really important to all of those running reddit bots and apps to aid with subreddit moderation and operation Additionally the new mobile subreddit appearance and styling stuff which the official reddit app uses mind you like mobile color and mobile bannericon still isnt accessible via the API It would also be great if thirdparties could also use the wonderful new ireddit image uploadinghosting server so we can all move away from the rapidly declining experience of using Imgur on a mobile device So I beg of you please dont just put the API into maintainbutdontimproveupon mode Please for the love of fuck stop defaulting back to the mobile version every time even though I click show me the desktop version EVERY FUCKING TIME Any extra detailssuspicions on the algorithm changes Less dependence on the new tab seems interesting but I have no clue how it would be done deleted Regarding sponsored postings Since they wont be able to downvote off the page it would be nice if we could see the current vote count on them anyway when they go into negative numbers It shows the community that while we still need to be shown ads we dont have to like their content it would also show products that dont fit they dont have to keep wasting their money on advertising that the audience wouldnt embrace I dont know where else to ask this but what happened to rapocalympics Why is it private now  The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system Its hacks all the way down Is this a secret way to say BuzzFeed is working with Reddit now What the hell is an AntiEvil team Can you guys add an adult tag so I dont get drowned in porn when I go to rall A way to filter out all the porn would make rall actually usable If you can let me only use the desktop version of reddit on my iPhone that would be great What is this  thing uspez Are you going to do anything about the buying and selling of reddit accounts at Removed Heres what Reddits Terms of Service says  You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account  You may not license transfer sell or assign Your Account without our written approval If this is done with approval then it just proves  that Reddit is controlled Most likely this isnt done with approval How would people know that there has been a change of accounts Why would anyone notify someone that they wish to sell their account Edit First off goldhttpsmediagiphycommediaMfmoWAFVKgiphygif Second i wasnt expecting this to get as popular as it did or for uspez to even answer Ive Removed the site Not giving them anymore traffic Also some have been asking why this is an issue This goes beyond CTR buying accounts and polluting rpolitics This can jeopardize and affect the entire the site ueSsEnCeOfEcLiPsE had a good take on it herehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentsxaclicktohearaboutsomeofthethingsthathavedcjf hey uSpez Im a mod for rWatches and a decent chunk of our mod team uses reddit on mobile specifically iPhones What is the time table for moderator tools even just a measly removeapprove function coming to the mobile app It would be phenomenal to get other things such as a separate button for mod mail but I imagine that is not coming any time soon Im currently working on a shocking  myself if the bran muffin I ate last night has any say This title gave me cancer Buzzfeed I also cant remember the last time Reddit ed on me Yay Hello Any update on the iPad app Im actually enjoying the official reddit app for iOS Took a while but its growing on me My biggest criticism can we have an option to make the buttons on comments bigger or easier to tap Usually its simple Click on comment vote buttons appear pick my vote But then theres the comments with only one or two words Or pun threads Click on comment Somehow missed and collapsed comments below it Tap to uncollapse Oops tapped on commenters username Back out of user page Try again til it works Good morning  days ago I posted thishttpswwwredditcomrdefaultmodscommentswptkhacoversationonthetopicofsuspendingusers about a user who doxxed someone who submitted to rtifu They were suspended but came back about a half hour later Can reddit PLEASE make doxxing a one and done offense Ive been doxxed and it was one of the worst things Ive ever been through Thank you for any help you can provide on this topic Purely out of curiosity is there in any sort of works the possibility of changing the subreddit moderator system from the strict seniority that it is to some kind of democratic form The most common complaint for many users and mods about Reddit is the arbitrary nature of leadership for many forums sometimes to great detriment I also want to mention that I have been talking with some friends who are new to reddit they LOVE the mobile web interface Im old and salty but it does seem to be a good design direction uspez improved personalization Please make this optout Reddit is one of the few mainstream sites that still has the ability to show the exact same content to everyone I understand voting systems arent the best way to rank content but youre making a terrible mistake by replacing it with personalization I really hope that you guys will make the effort to improve the ranking algorithms so that conflicting world views arent drowned out You guys have all the data in the world to determine my personal opinions and could block out things I disagree with a flick of a switch but this is just not the right thing to do Personalization could be used to expand peoples views of the world not shrink it like facebook does What would be great is if the data used for personalization was viewable and controllable by users Im sure many users will be okay with personalization as long as you can view the data and disable tracking for certain subreddits or domain names Also something really needs to be done about shills I probably wouldnt have used that word a few years ago but now there are literally shills on reddit Major subreddits are turning into propaganda for American political parties Theyre buying and selling accounts and engaging in vote manipulation You cant trust reddit as a news source when this kind of behavior is allowed Oh and please make it possible to disable outredditcom tracking when youre logged out I have that domain blocked via etchosts and its incredibly annoying not being able to use reddit logged out Edit A lot of people have voiced their concerns about this An admin response would be appreciated Reddit users hate him  we tested adding affiliate tags to ecommerce links which we ended up turning off Ladies and gentlemen may I present to you a company that actually listened to us deleted Will the android and iOS app ever go open source like most of reddit I think it would be a great way to allow people to add the improvements they want like they already did with RES on PC uspez this thread has been on my front page all day yet the trump AMA disappeared within hours Why did a less trafficked post with a naked picture of trump stay on the front page yet the AMA was off of it within hours Hey uspez  I was wondering if I could ask what improvements are being made towards mredditcom Wonderful work by the way  Have a wonderful day Something something clickbait headlines Can you give the people a guarantee that reddits front page algorithm wont be manipulated for political reasons the way Twitters trending hashtags sometimes is Hi uspez I have a question regarding your selfserve and managed advertising platforms Will you be expanding their capabilities in the near future adding customizable and exportable reports for instance or easier creative and campaign management tools If we had the ability to fund a bucket that we could spend from for campaigns that would be a ton of help also when it comes to split testing things like landers and creatives without having to lock in a charge percampaign Thank you in advance for your time Edit thinks to things Stop forcing me into the mobile version and suggesting the app just because Im on mobile I far prefer desktop and seem to have reset at least once a week including when i google search for something on reddit Let me tick the box permanently on my settings so if i am logged in i never have to see mredditcom ever again TIL Reddit admin duties are outsourced to Buzzfeed Are you guys working on a better way to censor people we disagree with Are we going to have a feature where we can set reddit to a mobile site version or desktop version permanently It is a real hassle while I am in Safari to continuous switch from mobile Reddit to desktop version Why was the affiliate tag thing turned off Didnt see why in that thread you linked Can you please do something about the astrofuring rpolitics is unreadable and is being constantly brigaded by Correct The Record  In the last quarter weve reduced harassment reports by  spam reports by  and moderator spam removals by  Weve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially dropping our average response time from  hours to  in the process This seems odd since the majority of time we still get no response at all when trying to get help with problems relating to subs I moderate However the new mod mail seems to be a step in the right direction well done on that Could we please not have blatant scamrip off websites as ads on the mobile website Theyre all the same type of scheme and market and Im sure its the same business at the top but theyre everywhere Advertisements that say pretty verbatim Hey reddit I just opened by new dog collarwatchsunglasses business and am looking for some people to get the word out If you type in REDDIT WATCH in the checkout youll get my  watch for free All I need you guys to do is pay the shipping on it And it links to what seems like a real website for some nice looking product However the website is actually just buying cheap intentionally poorly made watches or similar from Kazakhstan for  each and charging  for shipping and handling Its just stupid that this is one of the most major websites online and our ads are entirely scams and shady marketing Like holy shit chans banner ads are just for dildos and hentai but at least I believe them Hi uspez I actually have no issue with the proposed ad structures but thanks for the continued updates Could you please provide some clarity on when comment saving is coming to the mobile apps This has been a feature for years and has yet to make its way over to mobile I beg of you please please help us out At least let us view our saved comments on mobilewhen we ask in rredditmobile all they say is soon but they refuse to elaborate further When are you going to have an app for HarambeOS Edit Guilded Thank you kind Redditor I never knew this day would come Id like to thank my lawyers and that kid who fell in the pit  Are all the poop jokes getting gilded Shit Want me to spend money as an advertiser Let me target ads to people who have upvoted or commented certain posts So if Im selling product X online and there is a post about  reasons why X is great it would be valuable to reach people who have upvotedcommented on that post Being able to target based on countries visited in the past would also be cool because Im interested in reaching people who have visited Japan but Im not sure if thats just me deleted I tried out the mobile app but Im still not satisfied with them Honestly I like the the compact web versionhttpredditcomcompact over the app and even the new mobile site Can we expect for the compact version to stay or will it be eliminated after the current mobile site is up and running Im a much bigger fan of compact than mreddit Unfortunately recently it hasnt been saving states Will compact be deprecated or retained when are you going to work on the layout of rCannibals and when are you going to win a round in rpicturegame A solid  will blow your colon not your mind I run a support team and while your reduction is pretty impressive its still almost a full working day I was able to get my teams response time down to under  hours and maintain a  customer satisfaction rate Im interested in the number of requests as well We get anywhere from  cases a week and can handle it with a team of four agents Hi spez question about defaults I know I am a super evil default mod that wants my status more than anything But I am really happy that reddit is working on onboarding instead of the default system  My question with onboarding is do you think there will still be at least some kind of default set Is it going to be more like Twitter where we HAVE to make it our own Or do we not know yet Guess my question is where do we stand when it comes to Reddit onboarding What can we expect Or is it too early to expect anything Please tell me you dont take all the hate you get personally Everyone talking about the clickbait and Im all like Neat new front page algorithms Hi uspez When you rolled out the selfpost karma changehttpswwwredditcomrannouncementscommentstmbkarmafortextpostsakaselfposts there was lots of critique to which the answer was basically lets wait and see Weve waited Do you have any plans to act on the negative response from communities and many mods and revert the change or well just forget it Excited for a new algorithm seeing things on my frontpage that have been there since yesterday is getting a bit old  AntiEvil Trust  Safety and Community teams You could have just named it MiniTru and called it a day Hey uspez Its been about a year since the reddit blackout of last year occurred When that happened there was a number of backend improvements that were promised by the development team eg to better support moderating a subreddit Have those been delivered Can any of the moderators of said subreddits comment as well uspez can you pls improve the keyboard navigation on reddit how cool would it be if i could just move from post to post while pressing the down key and upvotedownvote with the U and D buttons and if i could skip to the next page with pressing the right arrowkey i know that you can already navigate with the tab button but its really not nice and easy pls let us use the arrow keys How will these changes affect my shilling payments from you guys Its not easy keeping the community from knowing that the admins are lizards from Mars Not really a fan of mmobile Its really hard to read comment chains or differentiate posts as the borders are non existent Where does the first comment chain end The green little circle is not enough Why is the upvote button so small Everything seems fadedmeshed together I need my borders I like the way compact looks Also its just harder to browse reddit in general The loading times are slighty slower but the biggest deal is it cutsthe contet in half On compact mode i see  posts on my screen at once On m I see  Why is it so big I personally liked browsing reddit on desktop mode better than mreddit deleted deleted When will the tackling of power hungry mods commence Props to the mobile reddit webpage It looks fantastic and works really well Is it still true that the best way to delete a comment from reddit is to edit it to  or similar Youve said before that you dont save the revision history but you do save but dont display deleted comments deleted Why keep the IP address that was used to create the account What did you edit We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances Can you expand on exigent If you get a request for my IP because a government thinks Im a terrorist based on my post history what goes down What do you mean by pixel data And would you have an opt out feature for users who dont want things like that Does Reddit respect DNT Do Not Track Also can you provide technical information on how your pixel data is handled eg frequency time headers data sent data returned etc How do ads improve user experience I fully understand that there are revenue goals to meet but I find that equating ad delivery with user experience to be completely in opposition deleted deleted As someone on mobile I strongly disagree We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have a better user experience What better user experience would be the result of sharing information Better targeted advertising I use the app that requires the least permissions read and modify usb and full network access No ads are on my screen What feature am I missing that sharing my information would facilitate Ive used most of the android apps I dont find any of the user interface changes worth the my screen space reducing due to advertising I understand reddit has to have income to keep the site around Im just less willing to have adds on mobile When we see an official reddit app for Android if there are ads I wouldnt know what would draw me towards it I do appreciate the open forum and I apologize if it comes across as ponted Thank you Could you clarify your stand on the DMCA For instance what kind of material would you have removed from the website Just dont sell my data and Ill be happy Have you considered dropping PayPal completely and using a different service that doesnt claim the right to freeze andor seize any and all money in my account for literally whatever reason they want How does this change how moderators of subreddits can see their user data Can they see the IP address etc or just have normal view of the user with the public profile If spammers or trolls get out of control in a subreddit how can moderators stop them without messaging the admins about it This is going to probably be a stupid question to some but I use Alien Blue free version on iOS I was always under the impression that this is not the official app but I thought I read somewhere recently that Reddit purchased it from the original developer Is this true If not true what ISARE the official reddit apps where these mobile privacy policy changes will be going into effect As a moderator of one of the more contentious subs does this mean that multiaccounts can only be identified by originating IP address We have a problem with people circumventing bans with multiple accounts We have had some admin help in shadowbanning whole clusters of accounts but is this change going to change or make that more difficult  we also plan to publish a transparency report to let you know when we disclosed or removed user information in response to external requests in  This report covers government information requests for user information and copyright removal requests and it summarizes how we responded Does the government request user information from reddit often Im guessing this will be answered in the transparency report but I figured Id just ask now Many women have stalker problems from reddit It could help if you gave people the ability to turn off their history being available andor being available to particular people Im a mostlymobile user and Im not willing to give up my privacy I dont want you to have my location and I dont want your app accessing anything info on my phone except the model and operating system Just sayin  We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances What are other exigent circumstances and for how long will notice be delayed Youve changed this   IP addresses  will be deleted from our servers after  days to  Except for the IP address you use to create the account all IP addresses will be deleted from our servers after  days Looks like I wont be creating accounts after this change goes into affect  Oh and it doesnt specify what the difference between log data and activity information or for that matter what exactly is not considered personally identifiable data  Theres now a clause to In  exigent circumstances we reserve the right to delay notice to users Might as well not provide notice to users at all  because exigent circumstances is never defined   We also use pixel trackers which are images embedded in a webpage for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity Oh And now youre using pixel trackers Great   To make our ads relevant to you Adzerk receives information about the page the ad will appear on This information includes the subreddits used to generate that page which may include your subscriptions And passing the subreddits one is subscribed to to advertisers Because that cant be abused at all  Looks like Ill be gone after this takes effect  Clarify that we limit employee access to user data So can you clarify what this means Admins can see everything that a user does including reading their private messages and anything else they do with their account How is access to this limited in any way With this said Im also a bit uncomfortable with what happens when reddit fires employees or when employees leave reddit There was an issue last year with an administrator who acted at times as a community manager who had the power to ban the accounts of any user that he wanted He was either fired or resigned from reddit last year yet he had total clearance to any users account on this site and during his tenure as an admin he was abrasive with a number of users and openly alluded to things that some users had said in their private messages and made these allusions in public comments on this site That didnt sit well with me at all and I found it to be a clear violation of your sites rules and it was a clear violation ethically if not legally of conduct He no longer is employed by reddit yet he could have very well taken down all sorts of private information exchanged in private messages from users that he did not like and then walked away with it once he left reddit as an employee This type of scenario really does not sit well with me at all How about an update and clarity around the use of the shadow ban We have seen it being massively abused by some of the reddit admins especially during the early days of Gamergate It shouldnt be allowed that people are quietly banned without being notified I had an account banned and wasnt aware until notified by a mod I understand that something like the shadowban needs to exist to combat spammers but it is clearly being abused at present I definitely dont have the IP address anymore that was used to create this account Directly what will some of the data be used for Like what possible improvements Will certain data be available to users for stuff like rdataiabeautiful or rtheoryofreddit Whats up Where do I need to post the declaration about me owning whatever I put on reddit  You may not purposefully negate any users actions to delete or edit their content on reddit This is intended to respect the privacy of reddit users who delete or edit their content and is not intended to abridge the fair use or the expressive rights shared by us all Am I not allowed to archive or recordsave user comments anymore I have a incredibly important question It could very well dictate the very future of the internet itself You are the CEO of Reddit you can choose literally any username You could be God The Internet King of the Narwhals you could probably even lock your programmers in the basement until theyre able to make your username jump off the screen and punch people in the face But you choose ekjp Wtf dude We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances What do you consider other exigent circumstances I dont really have a question but I just wanted to say thank you for being so transparent with the userbase Seems like thats becoming less and less common these days from other websites and companies Will you ever surrender information to governments on demand Although I can see some possible benefits on very few occasions posts such as this httpiimgurcombpkLqojpg would be very dangerous What is a better advertising experience exactly Can we get some clarification on consistent enforcement of subreddit rules Us at rkotakuinaction and rtumblrinaction feel that many Reddit policies are enforced arbitrarilyinconsistently There sure are a lot of people in this thread concerned about the things theyve written in a public forum Im a  year old man I dont post anything on the internet that could doxx me or come back to bite me in the ass later Dont they teach you kids that when youre little these days Unrelatedish question but when will we be getting more mod tools if ever I want to own anything I post some subreddits like rocpoetry allow you to post your own creations Reddit currently claims ownership of everything its users post there should be a clause that any original content remains the intellectual property of whomever created it in the first place not reddit Is reddit turning a profit yet I heard a while ago that you were operating at a loss Slightly relevant why is there no privacy setting to prevent people from going through all of your comment and post history  We dont sell data and dont plan to But then  We are experimenting with some ad partners to see if we can provide better advertising experiences in our mobile apps Isnt that basically selling data Even if its not selling collated data directly youre selling a big bag of information to the advertisers at a premium price who then collate it and use it to target market to individual users right Im not begrudging you the basic business model  you have to make money from this website and Reddit has always seemed to be good with this stuff but the two statements seem incongruous Are diffs of the Privacy Policy and User Agreement against the old versions available We will never change our policies in a way that affects your rights without giving you time to read the policy and give us feedback Send a message to each user regarding the policy changes Maybe users will not visit the sitelogin on a day you decide to publish these Why cant reddit organize as a nonprofit Guys a block user function would be nice Can that happen some day  This report covers government information requests for user information and copyright removal requests and it summarizes how we responded If you responded with data  If it was anything from an organised rletsSuicideBombTheAmericanArmy to rtipsForDruggingPreschoolersAsAnOutsider or the likes Fake subreddits  Just examples youre walking a VERY fine line and restricting satirical subreddits and comments based off what you deem as fine  rbdsm  rwatchpeopledie  rnecrophilia  Who deems whats right or not Something as simple as rbeastiality is likely illegal where the server is hosted Im pretty sure there are PLENTY of subreddits I know about that are blatantly illegal in the US and piles more that are private They are there for those who share a common interest in things that might be illegal in one location and not another or are simply considered too taboo to express in modern society Be aware that any submission of userdata to a third party for tracking purposes for any reason would instantly deem this site as unsafe A question that I read a lot before joining Reddit Why dont people get notified if their profile banned for any reason and why dont the Mods mention the reason I understand Reddit has a very strict policy and that is good though but on the other hand i think it would be good to tell them about the ban and reason too Alien Blue sucks ass why why would you choose it over Reddit is Fun Instead of just having a written privacy policy can you have uyoungluck do an animated short of Snoo explaining the user agreement to I dont know a crow or something Exigent circumstances Can you give an example or is it up to your own interpretation Because if so dons tinfoil it doesnt seem unreasonable to foresee this being abused  So I took that survey a while back and entered my username and never got my gold Whats up with that And to stay on topic why keep IP for  days EDIT Also who the fuck downvotes questions in an Admin AMA I read both the updated Privacy Policy and the updated User Agreement and agree to them both Since we are on the subject on mobile apps I have a few questions related to the reddit IAmA app  the reddit IAmA app could use some updates to help functionality by triggering threads with a tap Or does this feature already exist and I just havent found it In losing the threaded appearance of what makes reddit reddit the functionality of the app is greatly diminished For example when there are two IAmA Hosts in the same thread eg two guys in a band the app wont recognize the other one as OP If the other OP replies to a question first it will show his answer as the question So only both answers are shown Also sometimes when the questions are already answered by another user and the OP chimes in to say yes thats exactly it as a response to the user response I dont actually get to see the original question and have to guess at it Terribly annoying  is there a subreddit for the official IAmA app where I could post these and further concerns like ralienblue is for alienblue In alien blue the subreddit feedback channel is clearly visible on the sidebar I am not sure of the origins of the devs for the IAmA app but it sure would be nice to have it be consistent throughout the apps  paid version to get rid of apps for IAmA As with alien blue now I assume this update means that we will be seeing ads on the mobile IAmA app in weeks to come Or am I wrong about that Is there going to be a onetime IAP to get rid of said ads then Tldr consistency and functionality of reddit IAmA app Lastly thank you for your efforts to remain transparent with your users It would be useful to be able to have terms of recognition of deeper user rights Please account terms or term accounts a right to our own database info so we can query our own reading and writing with equal power to any admin over our own account Being able to reddit is as important as querrit Terms of Logs could help readers and writers account for their terms Can we incorporate a rule expressing Not for use by buzzfeed Lauren Im a great admirer of yours but was surprised to see that you  or anyone with your stellar credentials and privacyconscious mindset really  would be selected by DHS to develop policy for TSA If the TSA is getting such highquality adviceare they just ignoring it This is like discovering that Tim Wu is an adviser to Comcast Dont get me wrong  Im not criticizing you Just stunned that an organization which does so much so wrong has had the benefit of such fantastic expertise then continued to develop policy that seems antitheticalantagonistic to whatever you a BerkmanEFF alum would presumably have advised them Kinda offtopic but do you plan on telling the community what reddit is going to do with the money it got from the recent funding Have you read and agreed to the terms and conditions So many people on here are so paranoid Not sure Im keen on other exigent circumstances mainly because its so broad Id rather see something outlining that a warrant or other legal process is required something more than just a request and or a phone call before data will be handed over external requests can mean anything as well Id assume the alphabet agencies but it could also include parties like the MPAA Not that this isnt a common clause but Id like to see more sites being a little less broad and giving with user data We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances Gross So if cops spin the right tail you wont notify a user that they are demanding info Could there be a ban user option Are there any plans to use google wallet for gold purchases I would buy gold much more often if it was an option Could you clarify the doublestandard you hold rKotakuInAction up to whats the deal with supporting the boycotting of companies in the name of fighting SOPAPIPA yet taking down submissions of people doing the same for companies running ads on clickbaitcorruptantigg websites Its nice that youre thinking about our privacy Itd be great if you could consider the privacy of dead people and their families rcutefemalecorpses NSFL breaches privacy in a BIG way Most humane people would consider a dead persons naked body as sensitive personal information quoting your privacy policy They deserve privacy too BRING BACK VOTE COUNTERS Transparency  marketing capabilities of the platform  Ask Us Anything Any chance of official public moderation log support from reddit Any insight on why mobile users are so quick to give up their information over browser users Wait youre the CEO Quit Chairman Paoyou SUCK  One of the first challenges for this group was how we manage and use data via our official mobile apps since mobile platforms and advertising work differently than on the web No they dont They both involve pushing obnoxious ads at users while simultaneously siphoning as much information as possible about the user The only difference is that the Web user has a far easier time keeping themselves from becoming victim to such scummy practices  We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences Of course if you gave them any choice in the matter most of them would say no The Internet is an extremely scary place particularly if that someone has problems dealing with paranoia Clearly state what you will do to protect your customers and DO NOT go back on the policies in place unless the situation requires human intervention Ask anything huh  OK  i joined a few days ago and posted quite a bit got comments sent to me thanking me for the great feedback  I will be leaving Reddit however  i know who cares just one person i get it because of this your doing this too much garbage  Its the most ridiculous and annoying thing i have ever experienced anywhere  people should be able to post freely and not be penalized  Anyway  i know others enjoy it and im happy for them  definitely not for me though Now i will try to delete all my info but if a mod could do it for me i would very much appreciate it Thank you What does your trademark takedown policy mean for users Will trademark complaints be treated like a DMCA complaint You guys are awesome keeping us in the loop well done and thanks What falls under other exigent circumstances Thats a hell of a variety of information to withhold Also when you say plan to publish documents do you mean you might will publish them or its a definite upcoming  Why is your content section of the User Agreement so draconian relative to other social media sites At least with Facebook Imgur etc deleting content revokes the license with Reddit however the license granted is perpetual and irrevocable with no deletion clause  By submitting user content to reddit you grant us a royaltyfree perpetual irrevocable nonexclusive unrestricted worldwide license to reproduce prepare derivative works distribute copies perform or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose including commercial purposes and to authorize others to do so Why Does that include content I link to if I created said content Hi thanks for everything you do for the community You should add a subclause somewhere stating that if a reddit user ever discovers time travel theyll be required to go back in time and strategically hide hard to open safes for redditors to find in the future Can you tell us in detail what this exigent circumstances are Any way to encrypt IPs from your view so they cannot be seized without a court order  Id like to see some method of abuse mitigation from the perspective of a user who is being abused Instead of just banning the abuser who can make many new throwaway accounts and go after the person again since they would obviously know the username of the person they are abusing allow a user to change their account name but retain their years active awards etc Maybe even just simply allow as an option a user to lock views of their history I find downvote brigades are also a growing problem eg userX dislikes userY and userX is a member of rsomething damn it its real just an example so userX rallies the troops to torment userY Option to change user name If reddit sells the company what assurances do users have that stored data and other info will be respected in the same way that you guys have laid out here Is this something that you would be willing to put into your corporate bylaws Ie In the event of a sale or change of ownership or significant change to this privacy policy users will be given  days notice and the option to delete all stored data  I confirm that this is the case We specifically looked through our records to see if wed ever been issued a FISA request ie before I joined the company and we have never been issued one This is an interesting situation because the companies who have been issued one cannot say they have but if you havent been issued one you are free to say that you havent You know what to look for to see if that ever changes Were letting you know now in case something happens in the future  Former CEO uyishanhttpwwwredditcomrblogcommentsjtsjredditmythbusterscbiav Has reddit been issued a FISA request or something similar deleted does this policy change includeeffect rd party reddit apps also why is there no official reddit app Id be interested in knowing how many government subpoenas youve complied with and from which governments Whats your spirit animal We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances Question Why doesnt reddit make this information publicly available for its users I am curious as to how many warrants reddit is served with each month by LE and various government agencies Has Reddit ever fielded an external request for information involving accountless activity That is anything related to logs of browsing activity by people who were not logged in From what height would I have to drop a steak thicklb for it to be cooked medium when it reaches the ground Can you fix half of my subreddits not appearing on the dropdown  We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances oh  and other exigent circumstances wait that could mean anything andor everything  We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences I wonder if thats wishful thinking I never want to give anybody any more info about me that they can use to better manipulate me I dont like them having it and I dont like when they inevitably share it They always say they wont yet it frequently gets out anyway somehow Im sure there are various opinions on this but if this is something you believe and that belief is the justification for something youre going to do you may want to verify that belief with factual data if you havent already Is there a plan to release hashed IPs to mods to who have to deal with recurring trolls Its useful knowing the person you banned before is indeed the person in the new account How about the ability to block trolls Is there a way to change a username I feel that my NSFW one is too revealing but would hate to delete it all entirely I didnt read it It would be more user friendly to create a simpler way to delete previous posts Sounds like Google How much wood can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood You did say anything  Clarify that we limit employee access to user data Since when When are you going to fire Chairman Pao define giving away data under an emergency what kind of emergency So now I can meet hot and horny singles in my your home town hereareayour hometown here hot damn Will the moose still be there to thank me for not using AdBlock Keep in mind that when you comment and interact with a sponsored headline others who view that same ad may be able to infer basic information about the location of your computer since some ads  like for a music venue in San Francisco  are only seen in some geographies Good to know I hope being welsh that the location specific ads get me some high quality sheep Wait so Im now going to get popup ads trying to sell me girls in yogapants bicycle pornography and sandwiches on the mobile app In all seriousness will there ever beor is there advertisement focusing based on subreddit subscriptions This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this useraposs privacy If you would like to do the same add the browser extension GreaseMonkeyhttpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddongreasemonkey to Firefox and add this open source scripthttpsgreasyforkorgenscriptsredditoverwrite Then simply click on your username on Reddit go to the comments tab and hit the new OVERWRITE button at the top  reddit has allowed ad buyers to tailor ads to your computers general location your country or metropolitan area as signaled by your computers IP address We think this is a privacy friendly way to provide you with more relevant ads A privacy friendly way would be to allow us to opt out of location tracking in Settings I first came to use and admire the internet because it didnt matter where in the world you are Now it feels as if the whole web is obsessed with where I am Just to piggyback on this announcement and the current discusion I have to say so far Ive been impressed with the nonannoyingness of your ads overall Reddit is the ONLY site that I have whitelisted in AdBlock Plus and have disabled Ghostery from blocking AdZerk on only this site Ive trusted you guys to not serve flash ads and ads with malicious content and you have yet to show anything that remotely makes me think you have any intention of ever sinking that low Bravo to you guys Youve proved that its possible to have ads on a site without malicious content and once you earn peoples trust theyll jump through hoops to allow ads to help the site out I just hope its helping a little bit That said sorry Im still blocking Google Analytics in Ghostery though because Google already knows way more about me than I care to admit and Im slowly losing trust in them Keep up the awesome work Define emergency Like would a family be able to ask Reddit for an account password or information if there was a suicide risk or something to look through PMs or see into a private subreddit I guess I dont know what an emergency that requires access to someones Reddit account would be Im not attacking the admins here I would just like some clarification Will there be an Android version of the app So Id prefer if you allowed the location based ads to let me override them  I often browse through a masking proxy which appears to come from a very different location than where I am  I travel but the travel is busy and generally highly regimented and so ads would be generally irrelevant so Id prefer to see ads as if I was at home base I hope the ads in the mobile app are blended well into its design Also I want to be able to purchase no ads with Reddit gold Will this be implemented  The app uses Google Analytics so we can learn how groups of users interact with it Ive been thinking about adding this to RES  solely to learn what features people are turning off finding useful or not useful etc but have been afraid of backlash since reddit can be so finicky about things I would allow an optout of course but still Looking forward to finding out how people react to this Its entirely possible to want to use analytics for completely useful and nonnefarious reasons and in fact thats how analytics are usually used You hired a company called BlurryEdge Strategies to craft your privacy policy How blurry should we be expecting Will the Reddit app be open source Will there be an optout option for location based advertising I understand the Silicon Valley status quo is that your IP location is not PII but I strongly disagree with that and would like the choice to not be tracked that way or have any personalization in the advertising I see I remember someone mentioning that Reddit will never create a mobile version of their website in the form of an app so people will continue to innovate products that enhance the Reddit experience Perhaps they were wrong but it does raise a question With this app will third party Reddit applications be negatively affected in anyway or is this app going to be released as the official app while allowing us to use third party apps I personally continue to use the desktop version of the website on my phone because  I never looked into third party mobile apps laziness could be a factor and  I didnt see the incentive to use the mobile version in the first place I felt like they were missing many key features that make the browsing posting experience worthwhile Will this official application work just as well or even better than the desktop version of reddit EDIT And a follow up question Is it possible to look into incorporate the use of other cryptocurrencies to purchase things like Reddit Gold such as Dogecoin or Reddcoin The posts and comments  are not deleted from our servers  ever  and will still be accessible after your account is deleted However we only save the most recent version of comments and posts so your previous edits once overwritten are no longer available Do you have any plans on enabling users maybe for a fee or as a gold feature to access more than previous k items Because practically once theyre over that number it becomes impossible to removeedit the information from your servers by editing it I know it has to do with caching and the way it works But maybe offer export feature that uses spare server time to serve those requests or limit it to  export per month of gold where you get links to all your comments which you can then editdelete if you want to Just promise me something Please allow the Android version of this app to be installed to SD card I use Reddit Is Fun and its really good but it plays havoc with my Galaxy Ace because it refuses to install anywhere other than the tiddly little internal memory So you will be finding me some hot singles in my area I dont mind the concept of advertising  hell reddit gots ta get paid son  but fuck me can we not act like ads are some sort of massive favour to users If you like is all you would give us our upvotesdownvotes back Great that you let people know  When is HTTPS reddit going to be implemented One visit to rgonewild and now all the Facebook ads are about whores and if a summer squash can be pushed out of a vagina Oh look a Mr Hands ad If you are using Google Analytics can you confirm if signing out of the app on your mobile device will unlink the activity from your profile in Universal Analytics Im in the online marketingweb analytics world and my understanding is that once a given device is initially associated with a userID it maintains that association unless you push a new userID to it such as when a new user logs in So if you simply log out it has enough of a device footprint to continue associating your behavior with the profile you previously logged in as Would really appreciate a technical answer on this one ideally backedup by Universal Analytics official documentation Also are you passing in a personally identifiable userID Google explicitly prohibits this You must provide your own unique persistent and nonpersonally identifiable string ID to represent each signedin user This ID is most often provided by an authentication systemhttpsdevelopersgooglecomanalyticsdevguidescollectionanalyticsjsuserid If you are using another mobile analytics platform like Flurry or something would also like clarification on how that works in there Is your privacy policy compatible with the EU privacy laws and if not how are you deficient Those rules arent sufficient but they do form a minimum level of privacy protection for the user If you dont meet them it fairly certain that you are doing something wrong You might also like to consider that the EU generally is having a sense of humour failure with regard to US government and commercial spying  and regulations may be on the cards in future for services with international reach that dont meet the minimum standards Better to meet them now Thank you for keeping a log of your previous privacy policies and for datestamping them for when they change A lot of sites dont do that and I think its important Additionally I personally find it nice to be able to easily see what changed from policy to policy without having to manually reread the whole document again As a software engineer its easy for me to use tools like diffhttpenwikipediaorgwikiDiff to compare documents but I think users would benefit if you provided these diffs yourself directly Eg Google includes comparison pages for their privacy policies sample changes from December   to March  httpwwwgooglecompoliciesprivacyarchive This all seems pretty reasonable to me I love that you guys always take the time to make sure as many people as possible are aware of the changes that youre making  an upcoming mobile app made by reddit Please for the love of god tell me it has sidebars Every moderator on the site will love you forever if it does TLDR  The posts and comments you make on reddit are not private even if made to a subreddit not readily accessible to the public This means that by default they are not deleted from our servers  ever  and will still be accessible after your account is deleted However we only save the most recent version of comments and posts so your previous edits once overwritten are no longer available Interesting How do you manage to back up the system including all posts then once edits are made go into the backups and update all the posts that have been edited and doing this to all past backups and all relevant posts reddit has allowed ad buyers to tailor ads to your computers general location your country or metropolitan area as signaled by your computers IP address Does this mean you will be supplying ad buyers with our IP addresses or that you will interpret the IP on your own servers and only supply the ad buyers with our general location Im not sure if you are aware of this but  geotargeted ads wont work with me I live in Australia in the middle of Queensland and in a rural area My ISP uses a Melbournebased node to route me to the rest of the world Geolocation puts me in Melbourne Victoria not Bogansville Queensland and not even Brisbane Queensland If Im using mobile data my provider uses a Sydneybased node thereby geolocating me some km from where I actually live Apart from the fact that I never deliberately click ads it is absolutely pointless showing me ads from Melbourne or Sydney Do you imagine the usual reddit experience goes something like  Ahhh  a few hours to indulge in browsing rearthpo no wait An ad Must click Whenever stuff like this gets posted I picture everyone just like at a high school assembly Everyones crackin jokes and trying to be the class clown Can I still use Reddit is Fun or will you guys be dissapointed Does the Navdata collected by the App also include the IMSI information of the user Why would I use Reddits app over other apps clients that allow me to browse Reddit such as Karma or Alien Blue Just wondering Might as well ask a question here When will we be able to buy reddit stock It would be awesome to have the ability to disallow these Thanks for being so transparent  Okay going to reactivate AdBlock Plus for Reddit to avoid localisation Will an iPad version of the app be available eventually I know this isnt exactly related but I havent found any great reddit apps for the Ipad yet and Im stuck using a mobilesized version of the app since it works best Transparency gives me an erection Are there plans on using any other user data to target ads in future Things like age karma etc deleted  we only use information collected via the app to provide our service Shouldnt this be  we use information collected via the app only to provide our service The way its written at the moment it sounds like its restricting the source of the information not how you use it unless required by law you sold us out to the NSA can you go on record saying you will never give our data unwillingly to third parties also please define by law when would you be handing over said data and what would it take to release that info I hate when companies say to provide you with ads as if we want them So will this finally sync browsing between mobile and desktop accounts No more blue links when I get home Its beautiful deleted Can you make the mobile app make a ring tone when a Reddit person is near the vicinity with their handle Possibly with face recognition and maybe a credit score and dating background screen Looking great Just please promise me you will not go all Google Plus on us when people dont adopt new features as fast as you want Nobody likes to have cool stuff forced upon them Keep being Reddit please I was to applaud Reddit for going through such lengths to be this transparent about their policy change even going as far as hiring a consulting agency to help out with it ukemitche Id buy you Reddit Gold but you dont need it as an admin so Ill buy a year for myself Greed or WinWin Any sort of opt out for locations Ill accept the Ads only if they are personalized for Reddit Via whoever does the Silly Moose portrait I wish the government would announce laws this way Where the peasants can ask questions and the lawmakers are involved in a real discussion Is this going to be the general direction for reddit as time goes on and you need to monetize Or will you be focusing on alternative streams of revenue For instance should we expect you to roll back your privacy policy further to include more and more targeted ads as the site grows Obviously this is not a huge change in policy but it is definitely a concern among many of your savvy users Thanks for letting us participate in the discussion surrounding your policies Cool Im going to keep using AlienBlue ad free as my primary reddit browser Will I still be able to use my old app Reddit Is Fun in my case or will you do pressure to be the only app on the stores What guarantee do we have that this isnt just the first step towards profiling us like Google or Facebook So that app that Im using to surf reddit isnt from reddit So will there be a paid version of the App where we get no adds AND Google has nothing at all to do with our activity If not then I am quite disappointed in this announcement What about this great paid app Im using now  has awesome privacy terms  involves Google Thanks for staying so well connected to the community Sorry if Im hijacking the thread here but when will you be able to share more information on this mobile app Or have you already Thanks to all the team for running this great company Does reddit hand over my ip address to advertisers Is there any way to opt out of this In one of Gary Johnsons IAmAs the mods asked you to check whether certain commenters were coming from the same location and you confirmed that the commenters were coming from other places Why was that not a privacy violation  While advertisers may target their ads to the topic of a given subreddit or based on your IP address we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party Where I dont live is information about me even if its not as useful  we only use information collected via the app to provide our service and we never disclose it unless required by law or in an emergency If its not required by law then what is an emergency That could be literally anything to help improve your experience Those words are never reassuring They sound like the standard corporate obfuspeak We like you all When a stranger talks to me like this I automatically assume that theyre a liar The only thing I wish AlienBlue had was like a mobile RES so I wouldnt have to click through all the links to see photos But AlienBlue doesnt have ads IIRC so unless a new app is strikingly better Im not sure I understand the benefit of switching tldr you have zero privacy here Is that linked

and Im already covered Thanks MS From Microsofts Malware Protection CenterhttpwwwmicrosoftcomsecurityportalThreatEncyclopediaEntryaspxNameBackdoorWinCycbotBThreatID BackdoorWinCycbotB is a backdoor trojan that allows attackers unauthorized access and control of an affected computer After a computer is infected the trojan connects to a specific IRC server and joins a specific channel to receive commands from attackers Commands can instruct the trojan to spread to other computers by scanning for network shares with weak passwords exploiting Windows vulnerabilities or possibly spreading through backdoor ports opened by other families of malicious software The trojan may also allow attackers to perform other backdoor functions such as launching denial of service DoS attacks and retrieving system information from infected computers The following system changes may indicate the presence of this malware The presence of the following files  cdocuments and settingsadministratorapplication datamicrosoftstorcfg  cdocuments and settingsadministratorapplication datamicrosoftsvchostexe  cdocuments and settingsadministratorapplication datamicrosoftwindowsshellexe  cdocuments and settingsadministratorlocal settingstempdwmexe The presence of the following registry modifications  Adds svchost value to  HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with  cdocuments and settingsadministratorapplication datamicrosoftsvchostexe So your best bet is to check your directories for the objects listed Next step open up your task manager CTRLALTDEL and locate the svchostexe file that has been run under your username rather than System Just open up the task manager and click the User Name tab to sort by username Look for whatever username you are logged into probably Owner or something along those lines and shut down the svchostexe program Next delete the file from the directory and remove the registry key NOTE You shouldnt be doing this if youre not very familiar with computers If this doesnt solve it try using a Malware scanner that is available on a boot CD like

have a virus Wonder how long it will take till all the computers infected downvote this post deleted I wanted to be a nice guy so I had disabled adblocker on reddit Yeah sorry but its back on I noticed Firefox complained about a missing plugin on the reddit frontpage about  hours earlier When I clicked Install missing plugin there was nothing suggested I heard my hard drive churn a bit while opening reddit frontpage and noticed Java was now running when it hadnt been before Will a quick scan in MSE do the trick or should I go for the full scan Weve got some bad acid going around Everybody sit tight and if you see someone tripping badly bring them to the hospital tent thank god for linux editfor those who dont know linux is also FREE I removed this from a coworkers pc a couple weeks ago Windows Security Essentials detected it but could not remove it successfully for some reason kept coming back and getting detected again Had to do it manually which was surprisingly easy If you do get it and remove it make sure to check your internet proxy settings The virus changed the system proxy settings and Firefoxs proxy settings to use a proxy on localhost If you end up removing the virus this may not be reset correctly and youll be left wondering why your browser doesnt work I work in the IT industry and this virus is spreading like wild fire its very common I use adblock plus addon for firefox never even load these According to the link in the title the affected directory isnt for Windows  so not even sure if it affects Windows  Probably doesnt affect Vista either Would have eased a lot of peoples tensions Second unless your using IE its very unlikely a program just installed itself while you were casually browsing Most likely a popup or bar showed up asking you to install additional software If you didnt then no worries if you did then lesson learned If you need software find out what it is flash java acrobat or whatever and go to the website to get the latest update Better than that set the software up to autoupdate itself then you know the popups are a scam Third if you are using Vista or  leave UAC on and a little box will pop up in the middle of your screen asking if you want to install software There is no point in time you should need to install software when casually surfing the web if you do need to install software then see my second point above And finally quoted directly off the Microsoft webpage  Limit user privileges on the computer Dont surf the web with administrator privileges In XP if you need to install software do it all at once while logged into an administrator account then log back into your other account In Vista the UAC thing will pop up asking you to put in your admin password before you install any software which makes it very easy to install software under an administrative account while using your computer with limited privileges in day to day use PS A hardware and software firewall are a good idea as well Windows has a built in software firewall so just get a basic router with a hardware firewall and youre set Note that at no point did I suggest installing antivirus bloatware on your computer If it worked then nobody would have gotten a virus today I havent used it in  years and I didnt get a virus today Just something to think about Where do I go to virus scan my linux Edit Reddits internet sarcasm detector seems to be broken i hate to say it but adblocking ftw SOAFB I got it around pm est after I made an Ask reddit Malwarebytes tracked down three instances of it and removed seemed to just shut down my internet connection Reddit you dirty little whore where were you I think its related to minecraft Whats the name of the advertisement vendor who did this to us Is it Doubleclick Also  days ago I submitted TIL that perfectly legitimate and reputable websites can inadvertently give you malware through their banner ads even if you dont click on or interact with the adshttpwwwredditcomrtodayilearnedcommentsdzktilthatperfectlylegitimateandreputable I work in IT for the state department and this hit us before We discovered its related to Java and if AV doesnt catch it I found out that if you boot your machine into safe mode browse to your documents and settings folder look under hidden folder local settings application data and then just search for any folders that have a combination of numbers and letters and delete that and then empty recycle bin So far with this method we havent had any reoccurnces Hope that helps for anyone with it I use

browsing reddit I dont think its Reddit related My Dad and a coworker both who I know do not browse Reddit were both infected with the virus I was able to successfully remove it using Combofix which is a free download available  httpwwwbleepingcomputercomdownloadantiviruscombofix A while ago I got a prompt that told me I needed a plugin to view reddit I ignored it but maybe that was the virus An add I think said I was missing the java plugin Thats when I got the virus because I fell for it thinking it was a Java Update The virus was half caught by by MS security Essentials but left traces that Malwarebytes cleaned up Then I was still not able to get back online because the worm changed my Auto Detect internet settings to proxy Reddit should implement some kind of dangerous link checking system to protect this awesome community CONDOMS PEOPLE THATS WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR Amazing seeing this here And here I was about to yell at my son for playing on game sites with this computer cycbotb may be the initial payload but I was hit with three others The bitch set proxys on ie and chrome so when I killed the process handling the proxy calls I had to figure out why those were not working The proxy seemed to redirect soap logins for turbine as well so if you have a turbine account and tried logging in you may want to change your password They also loaded up two modem

solution Avasthttpwwwavastcomindex has worked well for me for years So wait dont you actually need Java installed to get the exploit Im slightly confused I would love some explantion and info on it I was surfing Reddit all day yesterday  home on my Windows machine and everything seems to be fine Like many I pride myself on not being infected by any malicious softwarein years I always felt bad for using AdBlockPlus on reddit but maybe it was my saving grace I havent seen any of the symptoms people are describing my internet was working fine as of this morning Im currently at work right now but when I get home I think Im actually going to install MSE and do a full scan to make sure  Pulled this virus off  machines here in the office in last  hours Nonredditors so Id say this is just proliferating on the interweb Its pretty nasty and was riding with a rootkit usu so watch out Will I be affect if I have adblock plus on Timeline on when these infections started being reported Nod fo

there Link below but caution of course httpwwwredditcomtbeq Im on OS X and I did get a weird request for a plugin that went nowhere This cycbot is getting out of control Im seeing a ton of infections in the wild Avast Way better at finding viruses than MSE and lighter on resources too Avast popped up a couple hours ago blocking something from the JVM when I clicked a reddit post I noticed the JVM was in my notifications for some reason even though I had no other sites open Thankfully Avast kept blocking it every  seconds as it kept trying to hit me I closed my browser Chrome and the JVM closed Nothing since then Oh and those who are saying MSE  I have MSE open too and it sat there like a lame duck But thats why I have Avast and MSE running  sometimes one catches stuff the other one misses My system  Windows  bit and I was running Chrome  It was at PM EST and my definitions for Avast was last updated at around noon today This is now the fifth time in the past  weeks that my JVM has been hit I havent had any sort of hits or attacks from websites that dont require me to manually runinstall anything for years up until recently with the JVM I seriously hope Java and the use of the JVM goes the way of ActiveX and the dodo Its shit like this Oracle Running Kubuntu  KlamAV Nothing to see here move along MalwareBytes By far the best spyware cleaner Adblock for everyone SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING I guess this has something to do with why Chrome said I needed to install additional plugins when I went to Reddit a few hours ago I clicked Install just to see what plugin it was and noticed it was Java I then contemplated making a post on Reddit asking what the hell on Reddit required the use of Java but I was too lazy to do it Guess that solves that mystery Anyone else find it odd that Microsoft released an update to cycbotb definitions today The temtation to troll is strong in this one I didnt notice that program on the recent Steam report Microsofts entry on the virus Note the date its antimalware definition was updated httpwwwmicrosoftcomsecurityportalThreatEncyclopediaEntryaspxNameBackdoorAWinFCycbotBThreatID I dont know how to embed a hyperlink in a word also if you dont trust my link you can google search cycbotb and go to your preferred trusted source of info Thanks for the heads up Dude I got this virus a couple weeks ago and it was a bitch to remove If you have a Windows system the easiest way to remove it is to use a Linux LiveCD antivirus program because it fucks with your boot record and will bluescreen any safemode virus scans Furthermore MSSE and MBAM were completely ineffective in the removal of this infestation Do NOT trust MSSE or MBAM to remove it completely it will come back I got an alert from MS Security Essentials but after repeated attempts the fucker was still running so I Googled it and came with these steps to remove it manually httpiimgurcomsprLpng Worked like a charm Be sure to boot in safe mode WITHOUT NETWORK functions and procced to delete the files and registry entries on linux I am safe no Just checked and I didnt have it Maybe because I use Opera Thanks for the warning doing a full scan now TF can wait Im sorry guys but this is why I use NoScript to block ad services like this Its not that I dont want to help support Reddit but rather that I dont want to have trojans infect my computer Who said Opera didnt have adblock My urlfilterinihttppglyoyoorgasserverlistphphostformatoperafiltershowintromimetypeplaintext didnt see a thing and I feel like Im missing out heremp And thats why I love you admins You respond to your users TLDR Money from reddit gold users went to defence against a massive attack of Digg users And not only reddit managed to overcome the attack it also converted them to the better religion Hurrey To everyone who came over from Digg and left AdBlock on its worth turning it off for reddit Youll waste even more of your workday when thishttpredditmediacomadsredditfun shows up in an ad spot Dammit all this Reddit stability is going to get me fired I depend on your periodic downtime in order to get my job done I really could have used those  or so hours yesterday Were happy to see that despite all these newcomers one out of every four visitors yesterday our overall timeonsitepervisitor averaged out to a very respectable  minutes  seconds You guys didnt just take a quick peek and leave you stuck around for a bit and took the tour And a bunch of you must have liked what you saw because a ton of you went ahead and created accounts Wow  visitors were new and I didnt notice much slowdown great job Reddit Also to the new people welcome to becoming unproductive at work deleted  minutes and  seconds timeonsitepervisitor Im surrounded by light weight procrastinators Im impressed a  bump in visitors and I definitely didnt feel any slowdown yesterday Great job admins deleted Im happy with the Gold investment I made Impressive work Maybe related but Kevin Rose isnt the digg CEO anymore they hired some other guy today THIS IS YOUR DOING REDDIT  SELECT nbs FROM users ORDER BY date I just want to say as a Digg refugee that I love the community here And I also want to say as an account executive for a digital marketing agency that I see the value in advertising at such a community as well I think more research should be done on the power of well targeted ads in a strong communal setting like such Maybe an undertaking I am willing to do Either way I will always keep Reddit in mind for our clients if the right fit comes along Nothing with pie charts needs a TLDR I once had a Digg user argue with me that Digg was better cause it looked nicer Ok ok I disabled adblock Now where are these fuzzy animals deleted RIP Digg The assimilation is completehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaenaaPicardasLocutusjpg Welcome Have some fun and check out some sub reddits Kind of late to the comment party but Im new here came over from digg Does not take long to realize reddit is definitely better I just joined a couple days ago but not because of the digg exodus or the new school year influx Ive just been reading reddit for about a month or two and decided its time I create an account Am I the only one If Diggs new format didnt cause this to happen I would be worried I feel reddit might be safe for now Ive been a redditor for  years Ive visited digg numerous times but never saw the appeal Im glad I stuck with the winning horse I wonder how many of these are going to become permanent redditors and how long digg is going to live after this Im also glad to hear reddit could handle the extra load Makes me really happy that my donation was spent on something spendworthy and not just beer as would have been the case if I had kept the money This of course doesnt mean that the redditteam cant have a beer for my donation money Heck have one you deserve it Looking at your nice charts reminded me of the How to Choose the Right Chart picturehttpiimgurcomYjWtajpg Thread herehttpwwwredditcomrpicscommentsafjhowtochoosetherightchartpic Came from Digg like Reddit much better I infrequently change news aggregates so I just never really had a reason to look elsewhere before Im glad that we have so many newcomers Itll be interesting to see how the hivemind gets shaken up I also really appreciate these writeups I know they must take some time to do valuable time but they really go a long way towards helping the community feel I always feel that the admins are there watching out for our best interests instead of creating Reddit v Now lets go party What Under  new accounts Respectivly Its funny that reddit was happy about taking over diggs front page when half the stories on reddits front page have been about digg I and several other people from the UK are experiencing outages Ive only just been able to get back on the site after  hours of downtime It was down for most of yesterday evening GMT too in the same way it was down every evening for weeks about a month or so ago When its down I get the service you request is temporarily unavailable please try again later This mostly only happens when Im logged in if I use another browser which Im not logged in on then I can view the frontpage and default subreddits but clicking any comments or trying any non default subreddit will give the same message I get some sort of error  when attempting to login in this situation too Im not sure if this is the right place to report this as after hours of downtime I wouldve expected to see pages of complaints but see nothing so Im assuming its only affecting a small number of users Is quite frustrating though This was a triumph  In other words reddit ads have better bangforthebuck than ever now mdash buy one today Just so you know thats what IE shows The new guy Jeff is hired last month and all of a sudden there s a huge spike in traffic Promote him Whats the usual bysource breakdown Id think a lot of people who were like screw digg Ill try reddit didnt go diggcom  redditcom but rather just typed it into the URL bar or googled it Sowhat are the odds this shows up on digg tomorrow Whats a google nonsearch Do you mean a nongoogle search our overall timeonsitepervisitor averaged out to a very respectable  minutes  seconds I cant be the only one who has Reddit open all day long  I came here from Diggwish Id found this site before its great Digg well I dont know the details of what they did but I know I dont like it and I find it not very usable now its over  I accidentally clicked on the link at the bottom about how to add an exception for adblock but read it anyway because Im bored I then learned that I actually have been doing it wrong and thus was denying reddit its hardearned advertising cash I will remedy this error posthaste Edit linkhttpwwwredditcomhelpadblock Ok I feel less bad about myself for being a recent Diggreddit convert because I didnt break anything moving in Yay for me Plus youve convinced me to turn off adblock Yay for you This place is great I was reading last night and then some more today so I made a name Good job reddit admins for making a site that held up to digg and reddit traffic at the same time lol Ive been a member of digg since  I should have made the switch years ago Huzzah Oooh pie charts Sexy Also I like the nbs by datechart The Hivemind has extended its feelers farther into the ether to attract new minds Now Reddit has ALL THE POWER MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Hmmm There must be some kind of logical explanation behind all of this The average view is right under m You meannoteverybodyuh You keep shamelessly plugging reddit gold and be true to your word and Ill keep shamelessly throwing money at you This is exactly what I had hoped would come of this Compared to my works website where the bounce rate is nearly  and average visit time is about  seconds I noticed that new stories now show a score I like this Thank you  Interestingly Diggs site is down Welcome to the Jedi order Well done Reddit Well done Wow by that graph the number of noobs today must be over  I quit Digg Seriously not cool what they did Reddit here I come First time Ive ever been on this site  even with the Digg fanboys would talk about Reddit  never checked it out Liking it A little plain but its not breaking axels like Digg Fuck Kevin Rose Count me as one of the converted I lurked digg for years because I like the lulz I registered here because I love the sense of community Thanks Mr Rose for forcing me to try something new the reddit samegamehttpwwwredditmediacomadsredditfun is awesome by the way Oh and my boss hates you So it seems that your noob level was just over  if that graph is to be believed Making an exception for Adblock was about the third thing I did once I hit Reddit First was be amazed Second was to recover and fourth was to create an account D piegraph The cardinal sin Big fan of the stats Is there a subreddit for the random stats Woah woah woah Reddit Gold is an actual thing I though it was just a joke I like pie charts     eo        comment archived           After a couple of blog posts that made me doubt whether reddit would survive the business side of it I think this is a very professional post that really sells reddit to both users and advertisers Well done When you will be awarding medals for our heroism in the great Digg conquest I am so very very glad that the number of noobs did not exceed nine thousand That would have created painful chaos for days Liars I just excluded Reddit from AdThwart in order to see the little animals and all I get are Amazon ads Damn guess Ill have to buy a boohey wait a minute Ironically the only time I felt a slowdown was sometime around am central time just about the time someone had made a self post to praise the admins for how well the site had handled the influx Overall though the site has performed extremely well given the circumstances and considering the state it was in just a couple months ago Not to say it was ever that horrible but had yesterday occurred back then I think we may have lost a lot of potential converts due to outages Welcome newbies Interesting stuff Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest Fantastic Thanks Side note I would have thought taking over Diggs front page completely would have been more than k hits Not that thats a small number but when I had an article front page on digg a year or so ago it lead to about k hits alone I thought a complete front page dominance would have been millions of hits or something Although at that point people had probably given up on digg Out of curiosity what comprises other Edit spelling How long before we start experiencing the Digg effect on links It doesnt happen very often at the moment But I keep getting that foxnews keep america safe ad  congrats team reddit you all deserve it deleted Ill reiterate what I said in an earlier post I have access to Hitwise in the UK and Reddit overtook Digg for the first time yesterday in the UK in terms of reach Analysis time Hitwise shows that Digg has dropped from  reach in UK at Christmas to  yesterday Reddit overtakeshttpwwwredditcomrredditcomcommentsdnojredditovertakesdiggintheukaccordingto Well done guys EDIT meant overtook Digg not hitwise I just reexceptioned reddit on Adblock againId had it turned off then on again for the Prop  crap and I forgot I had it turned off I dont know how many people also first thought about reddit ads after forgetting and just turned off adblock for reddit again but it has to be  Are you capable of collecting stats on who blocks and doesnt block ads Hey admin keep this in rDigg will ya thanks I adore the kittens in the box D I was a lurker for many years before I created my account a few months ago but still never posted or commented A few days ago Reddit became my first stop instead of my second Thanks for a great place Wow  from Digg Was that Reddit trolling Digg or Digg users raging against the machine So much blue in that pie chart Congrats Reddit is now filled with Diggers Have fun First off thanks again to all our reddit gold subscribers Your money paid for the extra servers that kept reddit running tldr Hug a Goldie How do you track where users come from Like how do you know they come from facebook or digg Thanks admins for giving us this info Its really been an eventful week for the internet hasnt it been Technically since digg users were voting reddit to the digg frontpage many wouldnt have been actually clicking through to read the stories  it was more of a revolt than an actual story promotion In other words taking over the frontpage of Digg for a whole day would be worth more than just k views normally That was an amazing job Kudos to the Reddit staff admins moderators and Reddit Gold members Love reddit  all redditors should come together and party Just an idea I dont know if this is possible or not but I think it would be really cool if you can get a reddit trophy for disabling adblock somehow Wait you guys have like k impressions on any single hour and youre still having money troubles YOURE DOING IT WRONG Reddit Wins If you didnt explain the way to properly filter the ads I wouldve never done it But Im glad you made the article so crystal clear and I done it and I appreciate the puppies Thanks  like this I have never seen such a high percentage for a reddit post before Re the cute little pictures you stick in the evil adbox One of them is a fucking delicious looking cheeseburger which I have clicked more than once and was disappointed more than once Damn you  Awesome  So when are the game jam games going to show up in the ad space Why wasnt I personally mentioned I mustve spent all day on reddit yesterday but you guys didnt even bother mentioning my name in the report How could you Regarding the Adblock exceptions Ive added them but the amazon and google sidebar ads are still seemingly blocked Im subscribed to EasyList if that helps Former Digger of  years Ive been lurking and finally got around to making an account v ust comletely lost me I like this format alot And I think its hilarious digg is down right now Thanks for all the hard work Youll be happy to know that Im back to procrastinating in full form I demand a I survived the great reddit crash of  and all I got was this stupid trophy trophy deleted Can you make it a userselectable option   Only show new mail   Crash reddit I know there are a number of longtime redditors who will like to retain the other option in case we need to get some work done Thanks for remembering us postmortem people Cant wait for the writeup Just for the record did you try turning it off and then turning it back on again Can you post ketralniss home number please so we can all call him to thank him for his hard work Im starting a new group Strong to Bring back the Old Unstable Reddit if anyone would like to join me  The site should still be wonky for another day or two Well my job here is done  I know there are a lot of nerds in the audience Saying there are a lot of nerds on Reddit is like saying there are a lot of junkies who do drugs Is this change due to this guyshttpwwwredditcomrpicscommentscoloquestionwouldthisimproveredditforeveryone suggestion in pics I like being able to check my messages Upvoted for innovation circlejerk What I love about Reddit is that as much as we take the piss out of things search anyone we generally dont get all pissy when the site goes down  we feel we know the admins or they at least exist in our monkeysphere When the site goes down we dont call the devs retards we know its a scaling problem because our community is so big now were more interested in finding out what happened in detail  just for the nerdy pleasure of it Time to test this theory Can you make it play a Youve got mail sound when we have messages Many women who do not dress modestly lead young men astray corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society which consequently increases reddit failures I enjoyed the suspense I used the waiting time to imagine the KERRAAAZZZYY things people would reply to me I thought that was a feature Can we get an option in the preferences to bring back the old behavior But crashing the site gave me a sense of accomplishment If ketralnis would like some of my methylphenidate Ill be willing just kidding DEA Not to be to fanboyish but  thanks for the hard work and for this great eh prepostmortem Edit spelling I prefer the sitecrashing feature Im sorry but this new feature is the final straw that broke the camels back Im going back to Digg Oh good A guy who hasnt slept in  hours is fixing things This should be good And please no downmods just because I have a sense of humor that is dryer than the Sahara In all seriousness reddit is running better than ever and thats a fact Thanks for the hard work and keeping our little community together Im still getting gateway s checking mail  is that still supposed to happen I cant wait to start saying things like I used reddit before it worked Okay lets look at some things here Thursday of last week Several sub reddits lost their content Many users lost their comments and or saved sites Then yesterday reddit overall took a dive Several admins were rebuilding content for users and sub reddits by hand Then reddit took a dive My guess is that all the problems are related or that in the rebuild by hand some forgot to close a function and it took going through all the hand rebuilds to find the problem Cassandra may have just been the by product of a typo  That is all Thanks for keeping my procrastination habits alive now get some sleep D So when the website crashed when one clicked on the envelope that was just an unintended feature and not a bug Without reddit I find that I dont procrastinate efficiently DUDE WHERES MY OLD MESSAGES ME WANT MAH MONEY BACK Back to the usual Gateway Timeout Perfect Was it the Flux Capacitor Im glad everything is back but I would say if ketralnis understands it better than anyone he would have been to sleep in at least a day There are a lot of us here who work on very highavailability and heavily used sites and most likely would have helped The Open Source model can be used for more than just programming Does this mean we will get our comments back too And here I was thinking I was special because I was breaking the site so often Guess im not as  as I thought I was edit facepalm was originally  Where did you put that bucket of water You dont know what youve got til its gone Thanks for the hard work admins No I dont respond well to change Niiiice You should really consider patenting this idea Im no lawyer but Id be willing to be Google would buy the fuck out of something like that Speaking of the unread messages tab what do we do if we have a message there that wont go away Ive had one there for months and its been bugging me Change Bad Rwar bring back the old inbox feature Its not fair this feature wasnt told to us before hand Im turning AdBlock back on gwarrrrr Nooooo you guys always change everything without asking us Change it back Thats crazy youre ruining reddit with your mailbox displaying ways Just to clarify old messages that disappeared WILL be returning Not just new mail Thanks Great Sucking my thumb while lying in a fetal position was getting tiring Its not a bug Its a Feature You break logo again on OSX Fix it now underconsiderated admins What am I paying Comcast for Whatever I liked the crashing inbox This place just keeps getting worse and worse Give Digg  hours and they will be functional again as well How long will it be til someone posts a link to a Facebook group saying Get million members and Reddit will revert its new mailbox Then well get another topic about how said Facebook link is the work of the FBICIAKGBSASMadagascarian Government whatever form it may take Thank you for working so hard to ensure we dont Work that is Is there a way to set up our mail so that it can still crash the site if we liked the old way better Is he finally getting some sleep now or tonight at least If reddit would go down for  week I think we could cure cancer and aids So the servers just happened to go down on Cinco de Mayo Dont lie to me raldi you guys started partying early and someone spilled a bunch of beer on the servers didnt they Im going to go ahead and say it was knthing that did it Maybe you should let keltranis get some sleep I think we can let an extra  hours go by with wonkiness Yay I gave this its th upvote  I am easily amused Id just like to thank the reddit admins to wait until my finals were over to fix the site With your help I think I may have aced all my finals I got a question Do all of these improvements get committed to the opensource repository for people that run their own reddit clones to checkout It may have nothing to do with the current issue but I cant seem to review my comments I see one submission I made but not the comments although they are seen by others since I receive answers Im still not quite sure its workingI logged in today to find my inbox full of dozens of messages from  months ago Im pretty sure youre already aware of this but figured Id let you know just in case its a unique issue So when am I getting my comments back on my profile To summerize bitch bitch moan moan reddit is free why are you complaining bitch bitch moan moan deleted I was wondering why I couldnt post any comments or a reply they would simply just disappear Ill never forgive you thanks guys Reply here to test feature I preferred it the old way deleted The letter is red which mean that I have new messages but messages are not found Here look httpimgurcomcckKNjpg I guess its because of amount of my link karma its spooky Your new feature doesnt freakin work EvidencehttpimgurcomixQjpng Im not a nerd Im blaming this one on magic The problem and the solution Magic That was fast Aww I liked the crash feature though Did everyone else get a orangered too Or was that just me This is one of the best features yet Does this mean my bug has been given some love too httpcoderedditcomticket Awwww but I wanted to raid Cassandras node some more with Jedberg Yeah this new feature doesnt seem to be working for me Thanks  Is there a way that the new mail also included comments in a link thread not just for self posts or PMs Its kinda redundant to have to open your own submitted links and then the comments to see if someone commented Is their a similar site to get a almost like Reddit fix if this ever crashes and doesnt make it back to life I mean really out of all the things in the world to keep me from doing that I need to get done this is my favorite drug and their will be withdrawals the longest I can stay away is for  hrs and thats it any longer than that the dishes start getting washed and the dirty cloths picked up off the floor my life take a complete flip Reddits new features are way beyond Apples magical impossible to implement features such as multitasking and copypaste Sometimes I feel you do this on purpose just so the economy doesnt crash from procrastination in the work place So Im going to collect the downvotes but I cant help but notice the mailbox is order of magnitude fucking faster and it was fixed in less than  hours All it took was a major outage and not hundreds of posts for months about how slow the mailbox is Im going to hope the comment posting also got fixed and press save Huray for outages And thanks Nice I should call this Orange Mail Classic Damn it Im actually getting stuff done What will my editors think Finally an exception to the every post has  upvotes rule  this one stands at    as I write Well isnt that a peach I knew there was something I liked about this place Im still on reddit  then cuz it still crashes the site I personally love the change It makes sense and if it helps take a little load off the site as well then awesome Can someone reply to this so i can see it Was reddit targetted by some vicious anthrax attack Tell us the truth so we can deploy our militant reddits to the rescue no way thats INSANE No worries admin dudes keep up the good work  Cool I thought it was the floods here in Nashville killing our interwebs you guys are my heros Not being able to check my mail sucked but not being able to upvote destroyed me I would always try to click up or down anyway and logging was disabled but the form was still there Oh the pain Thanks for the hard work guys Any reason why I would have lost all my saved items Excuse me but I prefer my old mailbox that broke Reddit Fix plz thx That would explain why earlier today I found myself inadvertently replying to  month old messages Sorry to anyone I confused Thanks for all your hard work I dont know what I would do if I couldt wast time on my rreddits OK thats great now can we have them hyperlinked by thread they reply to Thanks But seriously after all the hard work take the weekend off and get onto it first thing monday morning As long as reddit is usable i am happy i think i started going through some form of withdrawal Nerd here Id just like to say thank you for being so open and education when you make technical changes Your past posts have greatly furthered my knowledge of the interwebs especially concerning high traffic sites so many links to click so little time Well this means that Digg will have a source again poor guys were being locked out Nice to see it working again I always assumed that the crashing was just me cause I dont use a stable build of a browser So whats the new best way to crash the site if clicking the envelope doesnt do it why are there  downvotes lol OhI thought this was a feature The orangered was so much better when it crashes the site  All social news sites tend towards fark  Man I was getting a wonkied out looking at all that porn Thank god Reddit is back did mail cause reddit to crash wow I didnt know mail was that powerful Im getting other peoples mail Makes me feel important Reddit was down Oh shit I thought what am I going to do I actually dont have work to procrastinate with I guess Ill play TF TF servers down You made me play guitar and go outside Reddit How dare you PLEASE Stop consulting with the Facebook brain trust for new ideas for added functionality Thanks Thanks for the hard work guys thanks for the update I guess ketralnis let the redditor of the day award on monday go to his head  What a great week for work to make spending time on the internet impossible Sleep bunch of pussies I got your back Kind of surprising reddit never actually crashed hm i liked the old system better placeholder for future fanboy rant about how you should have used a nonrelationaldatabaseclusteredMSSQLlinuxappledonut Somebody get that man a sleeping pill a glass of warm milk a pair of Orange County beach babe sluts and a fucking meddle REDDIT IS BACK BABY How you guys figure this shit out is amazing to me good show Thanks for the hard work You guys are of the awesome sauce You should give users an option as to whether they would rather see new mail or crash the site Youre breaking features that many users found useful I got on and caused it to crash today I guess I should have checked to see if there was a big warning about not checking your inbox posted up  I know there are a lot of nerds in the audience dying for the full postmortem You betcha Mrmojorising really pinned it Youll be glad to know that hes in fact far away from his computer at this very moment doing nothing remotely like redditprocrastination My mom on the other hand I lost my saved sites Are those going to be restored Id like to read about what was the problem Sounds like a DB issue New feature inboxes show you your new mail rather than crashing the site No one could forget The orangered envelopeof DOOM You guys wanting TShirts and Trophies this is just as good httpwwwredditcomrannouncementsshirtcsnfnewfeatureinboxesshowyouyournewmailrather So will crashing the site be added back as an option Thank you and everyone who worked on fixing reddit  Now can we please work on the part where my browser goes back to wherever I was on the page instead of putting me back to the top of the page everytime This is huge to me seriously huge I have had to abandon my old user name and create a new one I had it set on remember me and apparently it didnt Its been so long since I actually entered my user name and password that while I got the user name right obviously the prefilled password kept coming back as invalid Tried to get the password sent to me and it came back as no email available So now Im starting over In this town At this time of night mmmmmmmwonky just when we got used to it you changed it up again Dear Wealthy Redditors Please show the collective love and send some coffee and pizza to the reddit offices stat They deserve some compensation for their desperate triage efforts I dont see any change at all Yeah I think I lost about a million karma would you mind just fixing that for me Dammit I have a deadline today Im pretty happy I got violently ill over the past  or so hours Reddit is a good distraction but so is the urpreflex Scale away with me what will be will be Will this service be free or will we have to pay in pictures of Lolcats Coincidence I think not httpwwwbusinessweekcomnewsnasdaqtocancelustradesthatmovedmorethanupdatehtml I seriously thought I was dying Now that I feel alive again Im going to masturbate sounds like a retarded idea i like things the way they were The site should still be wonky for another day or two but usably wonky The site should still be wonky for another day or two but its usualy wonky FTFY jk Thanks for all your hard work Liked it better when I was crashing Please do a poll next time before you take core features away Now  if only I could get a redorange  Is it also a feature where clicking reply doesnt give you a way to send a reply The only one that works for me is the default reply box on main posts oh and the edit button Oh someone send me an rmail OO Hehehe reddit slashdotted itself  How about real Reddit email addresses I still think there should be better options for subreddit promotions when you get around to it Thank you so much for all the work you guys put in to keep reddit up and running Just wanted to show my love for you all Thanks for the Update reddit is broken again i cant reply to comments but i can make my own comment if that makes sense hitting reply says javascript void  and it only took  seconds to load HUZZAh Dear reddit if you were a man I would have porn sex with you Love nerd New reddit feature it doesnt crash Much It sounds underwhelming but Id settle for this in most sites I visit First Arizona now Reddit I already have verified my gmail account Should I change it to my eduau address or my govau address to level up Any help Will I achieve level  if I verify my nato address  of the  spammers I just booted from a subreddit had verified email trophies Its virtually meaningless This is by far the easiest trophy I have ever earned I am opposed to this idea Heres why   Links that get more downvotes than upvotes are crummy and   Were going to start limiting them to a certain number of crummy links per hour and per day per week etc together in my opinion will work to silence people who submit controversial opinions that dont align with the hivemind You wish that people only downvoted links that they think should not have been posted because of lack of content but this is not how downvotes are used If downvotes meant spam you wouldnt need a spam filter in the first place Another problem is that it gives even more incentive for spammers to downvote honest submissions It is my understanding that you dont need to verify to upvotedownvote I think this will work in the short term but will introduce more problems than you want to solve I like that the verification email went straight to my spam folder I dont know Raldi this is all just happening so fast Im not afraid of commitment but sound of running sound of car door slamming sound of tires squealing People who arent chicken arent influenced by fear of being called chicken Is reddit going to keep a log of which email address is linked to which account What do you anticipate doing with that data if asked for it by law enforcement ie subpoena email randobygmailcom password hunter Now what What if  the only people who verify their email addresses are spammers For a normal user theres no incentive as their ratio of good to bad links will be high For spammer there very much is as it lets them keep sending links in spite of a bad ratio So my theory is that its a baitswitch  you want to get spammers to verify their emails and then ban everyone with verified email address looks at his email address Yup thats mine Verified I did my part because verification guarantees citizenship Do you want to know more Nice try NSA verification failed when I clicked on the link in the email Technically the Conde Nast Digital privacy policy is

Only AFTER you update the privacy policy will I consider participating many edits for content and syntax Can I suggest that once an account has been verified you dont actually store the address That way you can verify your users store the quality of the address and retain complete anonymity And what happens when the NSA wants the email addresses for everyone who subscribes to rconspiracy Now I have two trophies I can tell my Dad I accomplished something If only he would answer the phone simple No I dont want to I wont Ill stop logging in before I give you my email address Eat my dick I hate you now  Just an email tip I use this and have been successful in limiting the amount of spam received in my normal inbox Whenever I sign up for a site lets say reddit for example I create a forwarding email address for that site So lets say my server is coolguyyeahcom I would create an email address called redditcoolguyyeahcom and use that account to sign up for the site That reddit email will forward all email to my main account that is not published anywhere I also have a generic stuff and junk for situations where I dont have the time to create an address Anything that goes to stuff i usually intend on giving its own address and anything that goes to junk i know I dont need By using this method I always know which site sold my email address and its easy to just shut it down without affecting my main account I get maybe  pieces of spam mail each week and they all come from my junk account Once it hits the  mark Ill close it and create a junk Obviously this only works if you have your own domain but I think gmail supports this someone with more knowledge there can chime in Youre not doing this via https Why Sorry but no  I did it but no response in five minutes  what are you guys doing checking these by hand deleted deleted There is no way that I would give my primary email address out to anyone but friends the kind I actually know Work address goes only to work contacts which reddit is not either No offense reddit but the thing I like about you most is that you dont require my email address You dont bother me you let me come to you I can appreciate your effort to stop the spammers but Im going to respectfully opt out of email registering So lets see You have all the IP addresses I connect with all the user agents of my browsers you know my specific hobbies subreddits and through my comments you could probably learn the rest And now you want my email address as well No harm there me dont think Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete  edit disregard that I have a trophy  No way Im giving up my email address for a worthless trophy I think this is a good step Although the part about requiring nude photos might be a little excessive But its okay as long as you share the best ones The validation email was caught by my spam filter Surely comrades surely there is no one among you who wants to see the Spammers come back Now if there was one thing that the Redditors were completely certain of it was that they did not want the Spammers back When it was put to them in this light they had no more to say The importance of keeping the admins in good health was all too obvious So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples and also the main crop of apples when they ripened should be reserved for the admins alone wakeupsheepleredditarenaziscom Im just gonna give you a fake one anyways FUCK YOU  what are you chicken This from the people who stored my password in plaintext and then lost the server And so it begins Nobody calls me chicken Not accusing just playing with the title A police experiment Help us catch criminals by letting us search your house innocent people have nothing to hide edit they have since changed the title to remove the what are you chicken portion Im leaving mine intact for the records edit four years later I have verified my email address because reddit was making it basically impossible to submit new posts but I want to be clear I used a fake address with mailinatorcom Nice try reddit deleted Not to piss on everyones little validation party but shouldnt catching spammers be as easy as simply looking at the comment andor submission history of the account in question How about catching people with  accounts Uhm Nope i verificated my spamadress without problems Help us become spammers by verifying your email address  reddit will never sell your address bother you with unsolicited email or anything remotely evil or annoying Can we get confirmation that Conde Nast Digital and Advance Magazine Publishers Inc will not be using our email addresses for evil or annoying purposes either After all reddits demographic is one of the most valuable  year old males  it makes the spammers job dramatically harder No not really PS if your life is already hard enough so that you have to resort to spamming for living email verification isnt exactly a hardlabor  throwaway addresses like gcGssddmailinatorcom stink free accounts like joehotmailcom and suegmailcom are soso and anything ending in say eduau govuk or mil is freaking outstanding  This is a very suspicious line Why should it matter for spam purposes where the account is It seems like Reddit is trying to get a premium email address listing Sure right now the policy is to keep it private but whos to say what will happen next year or in five What do I get if Reddit goes back on their word Im against harvesting personal contact details whatever the motive Censoring or suppressing user submissions is wrong whatever the motive I cant believe this isnt just a joke Youre really doing this Not a great idea the way its being done Particulary links with more downvotes than upvotes being crummy That really sucks Youll just end up with the majority confirming and entrenching its own opinions Who said the minority is always right until they become the majority Well I have my email verified but everything else on my user page is gone except hidden links What if I have  accounts One for when Im at work one at home where Im not as concerned about the NSFW posts I use reddit specifically because I dont want to associate my email with my other online accounts Reddit didnt require this I hope that this is not a developing trend for this website Links that get more downvotes than upvotes are crummy Awesome This is a great way to get rid of religious folks and Republicans from Reddit No more dissenting opinions Yay Hey can you tell me what Reddit is doing about down vote bots I know this is slightly off topic but I cant find any information about it anywhere There is no reason for any real person to post quality links if they get downloaded to oblivion before they can possibly be read Maybe the email system you are proposing can be applied to accounts with massively disproportionate rates of down votes to up votes Ive tried it twice and it didnt work either time well i did it BUT I gave you guys a special email I use only for fantasy baseball with a friend for  years this email has been secret ZERO spam what do i get this morning Phishing scam email Ill screencap if you want to see is there a way I can take my email off now Hm I want to change the email address that I verified to another email How would I go about doing this What would keep a spammer from just creating a new account to avoid the email verification I would feel better about this if I could give you my email password as well Services like httptrashmailnet it even has API make creating s of accounts no problem when all you have to do is provide an email and click the link in it Example I got tired of waiting for enough people to sign up to Dropbox using my refer link so I could have the extra GB So I wrote a script to sign up  accounts using my referrer link Thanks to trashmailnet it took me less than  minutes Even without them I would have just setup my own mail servers and used a bunch of domains from free DNS services like afraidorg everydnsnet dyndnscom zoneeditcom etc A CAPTCHA would have slowed me down as I would have had to sit there and type them out but only because I no longer have a Botnet Way back when I had k infected machines and needed a bunch of CAPTCHAs crunched I just locked down their machines with a prompt to type out the image to unlock You need something other than email verification and CAPTCHAs even together theyre but a minor inconvenience to a well armed spammer Dont underestimate a spammers creativity either They make a lot of money doing what they do and spend a lot of time thinking of ways to make it easier and faster The shark hath been jumped No because I dont trust you nothing personal No because its bullshit Anonimity is fundamental to freedom even if people are happy to voluntarily give up their information Giving real information is optional in facebook also Will people who dont give their information be seen as more likely to be spammers If so a two tier system is being made Optional or not this will move reddit another step closer to having the content quality of the comments on youtube I think this is a great idea One question I have is what is to stop people from flagging competitors submissions as spam possibly repeatedly for whatever malicious reason What would stop someone from abusing it and forcing normal legit users into verification Do you want my address and Social Security number too ok I verified but nothing happened After clicking the link it went back to the front page No Im Chicen If Im a chicken youre a turkey I know this is tempting luck but I must say I dont think Ive seen any spam on reddit Damn you admins and knowing my weakness is an empty trophy case Do we get verification trophies Oh travis httpwwwfacebookcomTADAMS httpwwwmyspacecomtadams httptwittercomYODADDY Redditgmailcom  Two questions  Im a moderator hererpokemontrades shameless subreddit plug how do I whitelist a person should I ever need to  Why is it so hard for spammers to just make a fake email account like kjhsuiwoihwhotmailcom I dont see how just stopping mailinator makes it any harder on them Also great idea although I mainly like it for the trophy to be honest This is quite possibly the kindest antispam policy Ive ever read Nice Hey I no longer have dust in my trophy case After wondering what the hell was going on and talking with jedberg on teh Tweetor I found out that on Firefox on both Windows  and Xubuntu  If youre not logged in infinite redirection loop will ensue  Validating your email somehow only necessitates you to click or enter the URL and you will obtain a trophy on your profile page and be redirected to either the reddit homepage or wherever it is you came from Im not sure whether I had previously validated my email and a hit on verify just ensures that or if the entire verification is fubar Either way shiny trophy Edit Jedberg confirmshttptwittercomjedbergstatus that a hit on verify will redirect you attribute you the trophy and label you verified  only if youve done it in the past If you dont remember chances are you did  What are your thoughts on a weekly biweekly monthly we question that must be answered before any further posts can be made Any kind of bot check  captcha arithmetic etc Hi Its that time of month again Whats   two Write your answer below deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk Nice try Facebook Who is Travis Adams LMAO sure heres my email ITS A TRAP Holy shiiiit a reason to check my email I am not a bot Beep Will we kill them once weve caught them deleted I clicked on the link and got verification failed Does that mean Im a spammer will email verification end the annoying autoblock when too much articles in a row are submitted from one source i mostly get my daily news from spiegelde and am in no way associated with this news outlet and it annoys to no end when suddenly some script decides that im a spammer My email wouldnt verify with my Gmail account but worked fine with my Hotmail one Strange Well heres a spammer with a verified email address httpwwwredditcomuserrotigahil Never received the verification email Interesting now the spammers are attacking the comments Man the karma stations Please dont sell my info to people Im all for minimizing spam on reddit However I NEVER give out my email not even to you guys so I just verified myself by submitting a mailinatorlike account to you It worked fine so Im sorry to report spammers probably wont have any difficulty bypassing your clever verification scheme And just in case there was any doubt reddit will never sell your address bother you with unsolicited email or anything remotely evil or annoying They will however store your email addresses in an insecure database which can be hacked resulting in the breaking of privacy for those who verify Ok it was a few years ago but I still dont trust them Guys did you think about it  seconds at all Youre jumping to a solution that everyone else uses and you know damn well it doesnt work because spammers have lots of harvested and stolen email addresses I know how to curb this problem I dont know if I should tell you though Just think for  minutes You should be able to come up with the solution Dont be mentally lazy Hint creating accounts on reddit should be expensive and getting an account banned for spamming should hurt no not money what else is expensive Um my awards say Im verified but i never got a message in my inbox  did I break something jumps off cliff I cant believe people are complaining about this its optin tip for gmail users regarding registration in general youremailgmailcom youremailgooglemailcom Once you do youll be granted a lot more leeway Maybe Im still a little blearyeyed this early in the morning but does verification mean that ones submissions will never get into a subreddits automatic spam filter like when youre a mod Or just that its less likely If I do can I have my comments back Have we had the deputy moderation idea implemented yet I havent seen the boxesbut Im using Stylish so Im worried it is just blocking it out or something How come not everyone has the new user trophy We were all new once I know some about blackhat seo They have software that will automatically login to their spam accounts email and activate stuff They can break almost any captcha Should we verify all of our accounts or just the one we use the most Will some subreddits only allow email verified subscribers to submit content Couldnt you just introduce OpenID instead of email verification So thats where that trophy came from NO You cannot have my email address Sincerely Barackwhitehousecom verified and i feel special SOCIALISM Its now said verification pending for well over an hour Get your shit together Reddit or Im gonna spam the fuck out of you I verified my account several hundred times but only got one trophy The system is broken If what you say is true then why keep the email addresses at all Why not just send out the verification email and bam the address is gone To be honest I respect what youre trying to do but I know how easy it is for spammers to set up a mailbox that autoreplies to verification links hint very easy indeed EMail verification much like password complexity rules is just a think sites THINK work without verifying it no pun intended and other sites follow them in a very circular fashion Fuck you Im not a chicken verified meh you guys thought i was a spammer cos i insinuated dirty things involving barnyard animals and spezs mom so sure ill verify I was gonna complain that the verify link wasnt working then i realized that my account was already verified On April  vote yes on the national Precrime initiative omg you posted my email address i feel so famous please dont spam me i be cert certified deleted If a person does this does that mean when they post from now on it wont automatically be marked as spam or blocked Thanks for being open about it I think its worth a shot httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvqYWqkunJJgts This is like with Arizona F that I have two accounts One is work safe one is far from it Can I use the same email address to validate both accounts Offtopic but another question someone might know how to answer where have my commentshttpwwwredditcomuserpootcomments gone Im really excited to have a trophy How about a trophy for tweeting I love reddit and also a trophy for verifying that I went to work naked  Verification failed Please try that again  times already  during  hour  delayed nd attempt to see if system will be fixed If it was my code and I was a Japanese  Id commit seppuku to avoid disgrace EDIT passed from rd try Noticed difference between verification links  and  Great idea It hasnt gone through my email Im using gmail I checked my spam box alsonothing When I click on the link it just redirects back to the blog entry Im guessing you missed this storyhttpwomentimesonlinecouktollifeandstylewomenthewaywelivearticleece raldi Is it a really big deal for spammers just to get another user name I dont see where the protection comes from By god and like  of reddit I dont even believe in him if I start getting spam there will be hell to pay I gave you my real email Looks like the Tin Foil Hat crowd is off their game httpwwwredditcomrtinfoilhat Reading that explanation all I could think of was the scene from Jurassic Park where Ellie had to turn on all the fences manually Was it like that Please say yes The downtime should have helped with my studying for exams Should have I still spent a considerable amount of time checking to see if the site was back up Did you try pulling the cartridge out and blowing Let me share a story with you random Reddit admin Im frantically waiting to hear back from a DBA specialist while they look at a server that went down earlier and took down production across three multimillion dollar manufacturing facilities The reason A database had to be restarted and didnt want to come back up Sure we have backups but erasing  hours of production would fuck things up more than not being able to ship for a few hours Its a proprietary database format too because my predecessors just kind of said what the fuck why not and management has a largely leave it alone until it breaks then its your fault for not upgrading it already with the money we didnt give you mentality Point is shit happens Youre doing your best I didnt understand a word of that but I read it to the bitter end I think I got smarter Gotta cache them all deleted I assumed it was because Reddit is hosted on a Motorola XOOM and it went down with Verizons LTE outage I think I know why it went down todayhttpiimgurcomyZYNtjpg TIL about rdowntimebananas thanks for the fairly detailed technical explanation i can appreciate that a lot its impressive the site works as well as it does actually Software engineer here although not one who is at all good at databases Could you have a redundant memcached instance which instead of serving pages to the internet serves data to a disk backup the idea being that when you spin back up the main memcached instances there is something to recover them from instead of having to start them from scratch Or would that be no better than recovering it from Postgres and Cassandra I dont envy your problem as a video game engineer I have a difficult job but its one I understand very well  deleted I totally went out and passed a Cisco certification thanks to the downtime Seriously Its because I bought gold this week isnt itknew it I almost went outside today    httpcolonyworldscomwpcontentuploadswerebackjpg So Chan wasnt DDoSing it So basically you tried turning it off and on againhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvnnFBPMn Now the joys of postmortem debugging can begin Enjoy the next week of hellish selfhatred this is why I love reddit accountability Limerick time  My cubicle mate Mr Kevin Who logged on today on  He said yo reddits down and I said with a frown yea its been that way since   MARK MY WORDS In  months from today there will be babies So I thought you might like this The sleepwake cycle of newborn human babieshttpiimgurcomNRxKpng Some time tomorrow morning just when it looks like everything is running smoothly youll realize that you have been running on backup generators for the last  hours Then everything will come to a halt and the velociraptors will get out and OH MY GOD AAAAAH RUN I dont know what to comment so heres a picture of a ponyhttpiimgurcomOxPdLjpg I really love how the admins feel obliged to notify us and really explain what happened Its kind of like the companywide emails Id have to construct when a server crashed or a database went haywire I knew that most of it would sound like flux capacitors and transmogrifiers to the casual user but I felt better that they knew or trusted that I at least sounded like I knew what was talking about Just before the site went down a lot of post from rbondage showed up in the default RSS feed httpredditcomrss They were not marked as NSFW I personally dont give a fuck but I imagine some people like people at work dont like to have porno links without any warnings Can you explain why it happened and what correction you will take to make sure it wont happen again  memecached infrastructure Todays secret word is memcached Memcached stores its entire dataset in memory which makes it extremely fast but also makes it completely disappear on restart After restarting the memcached instances our caches were completely empty This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores namely Postgres and Cassandra Uhh huh I see Thats what I thought happenedhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvBVECpIxrRfeaturerelated I have decided to blame Jedberg Cause you know hes always at fault Always But that chromakode guy is kind of shifty too ill be waiting to see a post like this nine months from now reddit was down  months agowho just had a baby I feel dumb cause I have no idea what I just read but good job Hmm now Im extremely worried about the upcoming reboots of my EC instances Thank God I almost got pregnant phew Wait so the solution was to literally turn it off and on again This is a free service and youre apologising to us that it didnt work flawlessly for a couple of hours Might want to start doing this every semester during finals week itll be good for us December   a date which will live in infamy At least Reddit goes down on me more than girls do Explanationhttpiimgurcombyjpg With no clues on what was causing the issue we attempted to manually restart the application layer Its the first thing you think of when your diagnostics reveal that everything should be fine Aahhh yes the ol magic reboot I know it well I dont know what to say so I wont comment at all Question in the past much of Reddits downtime was caused by generic Amazon unreliability Is Reddit still hosted on Amazon you mention our hosting provider Either way though thanks Your efforts are most appreciated and Reddit has been rock solid reliable lately Kudos Did you try banging on a window and yelling CASSANDRA CASSANDRA I reckon reddit went down because the automatic downvote generator failedhttpyoutubeWAhjSviYVrts So you tried turning it off and on again and it worked I think I can do your job I REALLY think memcached needs a dumprestore feature The official reason listed on the FAQ for why it isnt there is that nonpersistence to disk is the whole reason memcache exists but I think that ignores at least TWO very important use cases  Situations like this You run a huge site you know you have to bring the whole memcached cluster down and youre pretty sure the data itself in the cache isnt the problem In this case it would be nice to be able to do a memcached dump  somehugefiledmp and then load it back in with a memcached load  somehugefiledmp Maybe you could have a way to limit what gets dumped based on key name regexes or metadata just in case it would be toxic to restore some of the data  Developers I want to dump the contents of memcached to examine it in a text editor for errors Or maybe I am maintaining a site that has to connect to a remote database and it takes FOREVER everytime I have to restart memcached for it to repopulate so for the love of god why cant I just restore the previous state EDIT To be clear I completely agree that memcached persistence should not be a normal FEATURE I just think it should be provided as a utility to be used when extenuating circumstances call for it The only time I will see improvements is when you get rid of ratheism Its all good At least you didnt shoot a cannonball through someones house You should really look at membase  its a drop in replacement for memcache but it supports replication failover and disk persistance  very cool I WOULD SAY I WAS PRODUCTIVE DURING THE DOWNTIME BUT THAT WOULD BE A LIE me reading the explanation httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvCcojlhLmSQ December th  A day that will live in infamy Worst December th ever  it was bs fault Did know see the sticky on chan They DDoSd the hell out of reddit b did eeeeet in the rear of our main server we found the remains of a hamster It was dragging two feet of copper wire that was tied round its waist and wearing a Chan tshirt There was a tiny gun still grasped in its paw and an expression of triumph on its little face I was strangely captivated by the explanation even though I didnt understand much of it Reboot ALL the things Thats why they pay you guys the big bucks So I guess you could say you tried turning it off and on again Im shocked that there is enough candor out there to clearly explain with considerable tact what happened  of sites will simply say we had a problem Sorry site is up again Good job Reddit did you try rebooting Where is forthewolfx when you need them For a fleeting moment i considered studying Is memcache infrastructure the system that caches memes Thats a lot of storage Im sure youre aware of it but about  hours ago thishttpimgurcomcNaxg was stickied to the top of chans b From what I read it seemed that a lot of them attempted to DDoS Reddit in protest and appeared to have succeeded The thread is still there if you want to go take a look Im drunk right now this had too many wordsI didnt read itIm sorry Its nice to see that you have a detailed explanation of what actually happened Didnt affect me as much due to me sleeping I wonder about how much total load your servers take compared to Google including all services except YouTube I find it remarkable that you guys are still able to maintain databases this complicated with such a small team and such a quickly growing load Thank fuck I almost went outside there at one point Nation plunged into productivity today officials still looking into what happened You guys are brilliant and I cant be anything but thankful that Reddit has such knowledgeable and awesome people at the helm Seriously you deserve a medal Yesterday I was mad at Microsoft that the Xbox update was late Today I was worried that you guys were stressed about the site issues and hoped you werent too upset That should say a lot instead of just memcache yay or PostgresCassandra why dont you have an intermediate stage and jsonbson your memcache out to files this can allow for a quicker cache load and cut our warming up cache process from  minutes down to just over a minute protobufcheck it And this will never ever happen again right RIGHT So it had nothing to do with the b Sticky about reddit tldr something went wrong and we fixed it Quit refreshing Have you guys looked into Redis Its diskbacked so you wont lose your data when you restart the instance Also Redis and Memcached isnt too far apart performancewise Reddits memecache finally overloaded Knew this day would come Still didnt get shit done today Im starting to think reddit might actually not be at fault for my lack of production Which leaves me the question Now that Ive stopped surfing the rest of the Internet who will I blame I have no idea what any of this means but Im glad it works again Dont you guys have a sonic screwdriver It fixes everything Yesterday was the first day I stopped being a lurker I automatically assumed Reddit was down today because I was one person too many There is no need to apologize Its not like I lost money or anything You are providing a free service and when this free service experiences technical difficulties I dont see how anyone could be upset Now if Netflix or something went down then Id be kinda pissed Yeah mmhmm I know some of these words Does hosting provider  Amazon  How many memcached instances is Reddit running Scumbag Reddit Closes site for few hours makes itself front post No problem Thanks for giving us a free website where we waste our time and relax and hang out with people who know how each other feels Maybe you should hit the gym I find it amusing that you basically turned it off and back on again to fix the problem Thanks to MODs for letting me study todayhttpmemegeneratornetcacheinstancesxjpg Did you try setting it to Wumbo So Reddit HQ isnt full of cats This makes me want to work at Reddit TLDR Site was down sites back up The important thing to take away from this The practice of adding a d to the end of the name of something to indicate that it is a daemon works well with things like httpd and imapd and logind but when the word ends in an e and the ed ending can be interpreted as a past participle the convention breaks down Instead of interpreting things like memcached as memory cache daemon it is more natural to interpret them as memory cached which makes no real sense This leads to real confusion when people use phrases like to restart each of our memcached instances which sounds like to restart each of our instances that are memcached but in fact means to restart each of our memcachedaemon instances So if youre thinking of writing a hire daemon or a fire daemon or a bake daemon please be careful how you name it Architectural suggestion Deploy two clusters of memcached servers I dont know the technical specifics on how it works but Im assuming you can group them together in serverfarms or something similar and deploy these as virtual machines on ESX hosts two per box Set affinity rules in VMware so that each ESX host is running one VM in cluster A and one VM in cluster B Only allow two VMs per ESX host Now my thought is that since VMware does transparent page sharing assuming that both VMs have similar memcached RAM caches you can have both VMs using the same memory for the cache This means that you can theoretically use the same bare metal hardware you have now but have twice as many memcached servers You can individually reload an entire single cluster but still have  of your memcached servers up and since youve oversubscribed the existing ones  of the future state is actually  of your current state Wait I dont know if this actually solves anything but I already typed this all out and it seems like it would be wasteful to selectA delete so Ill just post it anyway and see how people reply I shouldnt post while on Ambien Did you check your TCPIP settings Maybe enable cookies So you had to turn it off and turn it on again If that didnt work you should have checked to make sure it was plugged in Would it help if I got out and pushed We joke but you guys do an awesome job keeping things working Without you we would have to be productive members of society That would suck Next time try slapping the side of the box Now explain it like Im five Reddit A website where the fucking mods include a tldr at the end of their posts deleted Take down this sight for two weeks before the end of every semester Advertisement will suffer but the whole of society will benefit with more educated college goers Please post an update when this problem gets solved Im trying to learn as much as I can about distributed caching and cloud hosting services like Amazon Todays failure can prove very educational and helpful for me  I used to be a redditor but then I took a downvote to the knee I demand a refund LOL our hosting provider you mean Amazon What did they do ban you from using their name in a negative light Interesting We had some rather large memcache failures at my work yesterday too Its probably way too late into this thread for an admin to see this but Ive spent a lot of time and thought energy on the problem of memcache dependent sites like reddit and a few other sites Ive worked on On the one hand developing memcache dependent sites is incredibly easy and requires so little server hardware to operate at crazy volume On the other hand single points of failure are never good but in a system as large as reddit is I feel like they should be avoided at all costs Like I said I spent a lot of time thinking about this problem and did eventually arrive at what I feel like is a perfectly acceptable solution Keeping in mind that Im not sure what usage pattern reddit has against memcache or what you guys are doing to partition keys and whatnot but the site that I was building for had roughly  write load against memcached so the extra cost of writes wasnt significant What I wound up doing was writing a thin application that accepted memcache connections then determined the request type Any request that performed a write SET CAS etc was reverseproxied to both the the memcache server and a memcachedb server Read requests were just immediately reverseproxied to the memcache server The application had one other killer function restoring a backup Once you had restarted your memcache server you would issue another command that would request the values from the memcachedb server and set them in memcache I didnt finish working on it but I had planned to do things like have it proxy key expiries against memcachedb which at the time didnt support key expiration and I dont know if it still does or not looking at key substrings for command etc Im not sure if any of this is useful but its an idea I had Reboot the router The need to reboot You cant explain that Clearly it was Stuxnet and Reddit is covertly enriching uranium Bad bad Reddit Just delete System  That wouldve fixed it CTRL ALT DELETE Oh shit wrong OS I do memcache a lot before it was the thing slower servers back in the day heavy traffic and usually it was from collisions or bottlenecks at the wireswitch level that caused issues A blast of too many requests and itd start to spill over At first it was null data but then I put in a hook to put at least something in there to hunt for Then I realized I could timestamp it Probably not at the same scale One of the things I coded in however was the ability to be warned when it happens and code to start wiping out entries right as it happened by using the timestamp Yea I timestamp the cache entries using an entry that looks strange to some but I had the ability to do it from the start Might take a while to run but as its running from a remote station targeting and hitting the wipe from when the error started normal cache can rebuild after whatever timestamp instead of the whole thing whacking the wires on a total rebuild I built my system from scratch tho so I know its different than yours but it was because it was all I had to keep a particular client afloat who couldnt afford resources yet was getting slammed with high spike peak traffic during a particular time of the year It supports a million impressions a day with peak only within working hours at that during that peak They just couldnt afford pizza boxes or roundrobin or clustering and the backend SQL was always pegged this was a solution that I literally just gave them But sometimes it would crash and damn I share your pain I think my biggest problem was some servers on a switch that was battling the old autosense war with another switch because of some fd up routing rule or somesuch But I remember those days of pain wipe the cache then omg shit just crawls for hours and hours and theres nothing you can do and you cant even hit the bar so you just sit and wait or watch BSG for an episode But I have maintenence and watch scripts that look out for the nulls and bottlenecks and alert then I can either automate the partial wipes instead of restarting by direct memory address or do it manually I still dont trust the automatic but I let it run when Im on vacation Some are saying reddit was DDOSd by chan Because of a thread making fun about chan and the mods stickied the thread therehttpasphotosakfbcdnnethphotosaksncnjpg Its true I thought it was a Jap attack I love these breakdowns

mentioned I feel too left out of this feature What about Periwinkle why is this a gold feature twitter and any other social media notifies you when you are mentioned with an  symbol As someone who donated I really would prefer the engineers work on general reddit problems instead of special Gold Member features I appreciate the gesture but Im sure most donors arent looking for special payback We just want the site to stay up Im holding out for reddit platinum What happened with the guy who wanted to buy Reddit Why not spend the money on a solid marketing position rather than adding features that should be available regardless For example look at Digg they add features all the time albeit a lot of those features are downright silly You need someone savvy enough to figure out a way to make the site profitable Asking for donations a joke  youre a forprofit entity so stop calling them that because you cant write this off on taxes is merely a stopgap solution to a much larger problem Unless you can find a way to monetize your large user base youre just treading water With all the extremely popular subreddits you have the ability to offer advertisers a very targeted demographic Personally I have chosen to support Reddit by whitelisting it from my AdBlocker and click on ads every once and a while I will not be donating money to a corporation which has shown no real initiative in growing the site Reddits success story can be attributed to its community not its administrators Maybe its time to change that We just bailed out reddit I think that means its dun dun dunnn TOO BIG TO FAIL Great now please use some of that money to generate more money so you will never have to do this again You know Im sorry Im not rooting for you guys In the end run in the meta sense yes I want Reddit to succeed but this is a really bad lesson for the Reddit admins and Code Nast to get out of this Conde Nast executive Oh we dont need to fund Reddit The members can be counted on to support the website We have to do cutbacks next year  lets slash Reddits budget by  and have them ask their users to make up the difference If they cant well tough shit Reddit admin Oh we dont need to confront that Conde Nast exec who gives me the willies every time he tours the office And lets save Cool New Feature X for Reddit Gold members The site as is is still good for the average Joe After all the average Joe should consider it a free benefit that were not down every five seconds now that we have our servers working again Listen its not that Im unsupportive of you or of the site But this is the wrong lesson to be getting out of all this You got bought by Conde Nast And what you  and all those who donated  have just taught Conde Nast is this THERES NOW NO DOWNSIDE TO GIVING YOU AN INSUFFICIENT AND HALFASSED AMOUNT OF FUNDING FAR LESS THAN YOU NEED TO ADEQUATELY RUN THE SITE  BECAUSE THE USERS HAVE JUST DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN BE COUNTED ON TO MAKE UP YOUR OPERATING SHORTFALL IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLY PLATITUDES OF REDDIT FRATERNITY WITHOUT EVEN ANY MATERIALISTIC BENEFITS Congratulations Your problem is now going to get worse Neither you nor the userbase is going to see it now because everyones all flush with woooo Reddit woooo Reddit Gold go us rah rah sis boom bah gooooooo Reddit But your corporate owners are noting this and making their plans And its not even evil or sinister in intent Its just the cold capitalistic bottom line that every huge corporation adheres to in order to appease their stockholders Theyre not going to give you money you dont fight for and youve demonstrated youre not going to fight for it and theyre not going to give you money when you demonstrate that you can get your userbase to cough up dough in a donation drive So lets keep watching as Conde Nast rolls out Reddits budget in whatever installments they roll it out quarterly annual I dont know And lets see what happens to your funding Suddenly its going to become more and more urgent to the admins that people buy those Reddit Gold memberships Theres going to be posts to blogreddit about how youre sorry you have to raise the Reddit Gold price to  per year but its more urgent than ever that people show their support for Reddit since Conde Nast has decided to cut your funding by  in Q   Itd be glorious if I were to be  wrong on this I would be really happy if I was proven completely and utterly off base on this in the months to come that somehow this popularity convinces Conde Nast to adequately fund you in order that Reddit might have the robust growth its popularity deserves Call me a cynic though but I dont think I will be proven wrong on this one though As much as Id like to be Oh and to continue with the Still Alive theme from your blog post Maybe youll find someone else to help you Maybe Conde Nast THAT WAS A JOKE HAHA FAT CHANCE Excited for the One More Thing Reddit must exist Im not going back to Digg I still like the idea of having a redditcom email address I donated  comments today Just doing my part I love rlounge  like it Glad this worked well But I have to tell you that Slashdot made very little money off of subscriptions It was never really worth the money for what they were offering Youve really got to make Gold do something cool here Well either that or get serious about ad sales A serious suggestion here If you are really having money problems then perhaps you should employ someonework on improving the targeting of the ads that you display I gotta say that Ive never seen an ad on reddit that I would even remotely think about clicking on or that has had any relevance to me whatsoever reddit is not alone in this You know if people are subscribed to the movies reddit then maybe you should show ads for upandcoming movie releases I would actually love this Similarly for musicbooks and their more specific subreddits Would anyone who is subscribed to the heavymetal subreddit really be upset if they were shown ads for new heavy metal releases They dont even have to be flashy animated ads People who are interested in these topics as evidenced by their subscribing to that subreddit will actually actively click on simple static images simply stating that the moviealbum is coming soon click the ad for more information Of course you should still stick to the golden rules of not pissing off redditors no ads that make sounds popup or popover Also give us the option to block specific ads that we find too distracting or are uncomfortable with having appear on our screens in our mixed gender work environments like the grandma boobs ad Edit Even better why not create virtual subreddits such as rmovieads that display movie ads when you subscribe to that subreddit This will be viewed as a case study in business schools for years to come There are a number of ways to avoid going under Diversification sourcing investors cost cutting selling nonessential assets restructuring Then theres one more But I really shouldnt say Please tell us professor Well ok But you didnt hear this from me Its known as the Reddit model Um so how much did you take in Fair question since I donated  What is the thing Im going to love Oh god please tell me I have a heart condition I dont know if I can stand the wait deleted That pikachu postcard was written by my friend We dropped by reddit HQ on Saturday evening A few more shots All five postcardshttpwwwflickrcomphotosbnookala Postcards I choose youhttpwwwflickrcomphotosbnookala Bulbasaurhttpwwwflickrcomphotosbnookala And a pic of us writing nice things on themhttpwwwflickrcomphotosbnookala Glad to hear things are looking good for reddit Samuel Irving Newhouse JrhttpbitlyAqomT Owner of Cond Nast Publications Net worth billion nd Richest American by Forbes Magazine in  And he needs help with the servers Youre not short on money it was an experiment The fact is your owner there is doing ridiculously fine he just wants even more money and hes not beneath feigning being needy to ask for donations from the actually truly needy AKA us Donating to MultiBillionaires stinks c So Reddit Gold is a go huh I think it will be a hit provided somethings I personally would not like to see Namely  Exclusive content for Gold subscribers  Features that give Gold subscribers a clear unfair advantage over nonGold users like x karma or something  Obnoxious user designations like gold usernames yuck Oh great this link made the front page Here come all the nongold members Thanks for the upd  A Reddit Gold account is required to see the rest of this comment  I envy those with gold membership I cant join Im too paranoid about attaching my online activities to my real life identity I cant even keep the same username for more than a month The saydrah episode creeped me out She left a crumb trail back to her real life a trail that she made one little crumb at a time No one believes it can happen to them until it happens She should have known better Reddits biggest selling point for me is the ease of throwing away accounts throwing away my current identity Its more important to me than karma tldr  No financial transactions No home address no personal info about preferences Were not really friends and I dont really trust you Thanks for keeping us updated Reddit admins just ed us Ive gone Reddit gold heres the one thing you guys should really fix please stop calling it a donation That word is weighted and has a lot of meaning behind it that youre not intending The contribution is neither a tax deduction nor are you a charity You should call it a contribution or something similar the last thing you need is a headache from people who claim their Reddit donation as an IRS deduction and get you in financial hot water Reddit is my favorite site donating to support it is the least I can do I donated to Reddit but I am completely fucking against Goldonly subscriber features A trophy is enough for me I dont even want my name to be a separate color Dont turn this site into a shitfest I donated because I want to keep this great site alive I wouldntve if I had known that it would make the site less great Please dont create subscriberonly features deleted Im debating on donating simply because I want a trophy in my case Im that sad Oh and theres One More Thing coming soon that you guys are gonna love This had better be either working search or episode  deleted I wonder how the Techcrunch article spins this tomorrow I also wonder how digg spins this next week It was good while it lasted deleted Can you all accept Google Checkout or Amazon payments too I want to subscribe but my bank will not authorize anything from Paypal Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad thing Redditcom is one of the most visited sites on the internet yet isnt sustainable without donations or subscriptions Is the solution really to start charging people for more features and leave those who cannot afford it in the dust What people are failing to realize is that Reddit is not a charity case Reddit owned by a billion dollar company Conde Nast Why are we donating money to Reddit when they should be getting funds from their parent company Are we all getting cars What was Conde Nastis response to Reddits Gold fundraising Didnt they give you guys weird looks for fundraising on your own Sweet the cake was not a lie I turned off AdBlock for Reddit and will keep it that way But I still dont get why Cond Nast needs cash donations Heres something I dont get Digg is clearly a hated rival here but can we take a peek at their model for a second here They serve up much higher volume more users higher page sizes etc and theyve managed to do just fine They also arent backed by a major corporation that I know of like Reddit is Their staff costs are monstrous compared to Reddits I know its been said but reddit is very nearly a textonly site that feeds off the creative efforts of the rest of the web Thats a fact You run ads in several locations I dont know the performance and I dont care All I know is that I dont block ads on Reddit You cant seem to make even the most basic things work here like uptime let alone search I have no idea how you cant run things on your ads and traffic and lower costs but ff this gold crap doesnt work just close up shop already Its pretty embarrassing at that point So how much money did you raise I gave  for reddit gold I spend  hours a day on reddit  is the cost of one drink The way I figure I bought reddit a drink as thanks deleted Dont spend it all in one place Whats that One More Thing youre gonna love thats coming up I hate teasers I see your little Portal references You guys are cute I didnt turn off adblock because I never click the ads but I gave some money why I realized that I love reddit and my internet experience would be left with a giant chasm no other site could fill if ever I were to pay for online content it would be for a site like reddit I would happily pay a voluntary yearly subscription Did anyone else make a donation or contribution or whatever were calling it and not get a fancy trophy There are tons of marketing types chiming in but wouldnt enough people at Conde Nast a publishing firm no less have looked at the problem to consider all those same things Id love to see a behind the scenes book on this someday Especially the chapter on the offers that came in to purchase and believe me I am still online I am happy to contribute to reddit financially some sort of subscription does seem suitable However I did not donate to reddit gold because there were no assurances that we arent just handing cash to CondeNast I have no problem with others making that choice however All I ask is that once you get membership options in place you dont favor early bird donators over other members Peace  Oh and theres One More Thing coming soon that you guys are gonna love An iPhone for every Gold Status member courtesy of Conde Nast Learn from Ars Technica and Tutspluscom not from TotalFark Ars and the Tutsplus network got subscriptions right If I recall my web history TotalFark was a big disaster for the Fark community I didnt donate  I subscribed at a rate that I think is fair for a monthly fee Ill subscribe again next month and the month after that  except the ones who are banned It seems strange to call them out in a generally uplifting piece I mean its meaningless just make another account  how do the banned have significance Didnt seem like it was meant to be funny  Someone sent you an Ohio postcard What a dick Okay heres the part where the broken record starts karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store kacma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma stoce karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma store karna store karma store karma store karma store karma store karma stora karma store Long time lurker just signed up and gave  bucks Reddit has given me plenty of entertainment Switched from digg cant go back Ive deleted it from my bookmark toolbar Its funny how many of us are willing to dish out our advertising and marketing ideas for the sake of reddit ending up to be what WE MOTHERFUCKING WANT IT TO BE On a sidenote we need to start selling rage comic tshirts from the fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu sub reddit I know I would buy a few for social situations For example I would take my girl raging at a movie theatre shirt when I go to see a movie As I mentioned reddit can be whatever we want it to be I have faith the engineers wont fuck us with the future of our precious Its not that this place is any better than digg or fark its that the people here seem more genuine in both their advice and their jokes I also dont know how many retarded stepchildren youd have to shit out to make your comment layout as bad as the other sites If you found a way to fuck that up I would just leave I failed to see how this was a triumph The one way for Reddit to produce an income would be to fill their pages with ads I would hate this and so would you The donation gold would be temporary There are other ways to raise cash I hate to look at Farmville as an example but they have an interesting concept in using farm cash for buying personalized items for their farms If Reddit made it fun for the user to part with their money it might be good for all My idea would be to sell little Reddit aliens to be next to your name Offer  different styles at first It would be fun because we could recognize each other by our alien or combination of aliens You could sell them for  a pop Everyone would want an alien because Reddit users are fun people with a sense of humor We could have Reddit Alien designing contests Each user could have a storage box for their collection and bring out an alien to suit the mood for the day Birthday Alien for when they are having a birthday etc What do you guys think Im making a note here You people are idiots Great sites come and go all of the time due to lack of revenue and yet you all willingly open your pocket books to subsidized a site owned by a corporate media giant LoL Now that the pilot has succeeded so well were going to grow reddit gold into a bona fide subscription service a la TotalFark This will kill Reddit If you split the community that everyone here talks about youre going to destroy it Well it was fun while it lasted You remember how chan said a while back that they where going to come here and troll us The constant jokes about chan gold accounts has gotten to the point where the admins have started to take this seriously and actually implemented this feature Unless this all turns out to be a joke and the biggest reverse troll by the admins in the history of the redditt chan will have pulled off with reddit what it never could with chan gold accounts They couldnt change their own site no gold accounts on chan no matter how many times people post those same pictures there are constant jokes about reddit turning into chan Reddit gets gold accounts Let that settle in for a second Im making a note here HUGE success Id buy a gold account Im being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me Portal  The best ending to a game Ive ever seen Reddit  That was brilliant ROFL who sent the Akron Ohio postcard  Ohioans unite Will you be fixing the frickin SEARCH function Or do we have to wait for a Reddit Platinum membership drive to come around I dont know why I am so nauseated by this Could he be any more selfcongratulatory and clever Reddit is a marketing company I heard Jeff once coded an entire website with an unsharpened  pencil and a bottle opener My god Reddit just scared the crap out of me My names jeff and I just saw welcome jeff and thought HOW DOES IT KNOW MY NAME This makes a lot more sense Congrata CSS All right but I really dont know why Reddit isnt just done in Flash If you give the reddit logo a reflection I will come to your house and I will cut you Welcome Since Im a reddit gold member Im paying for part of Jeffs salary Tell him to get me a coffee and schedule me a massage for  tomorrow Jeff Heres a piece of advice When the site redesign goes live and there are  comments hating it do not under any circumstance let your only response to people be Youll get over it That has had admins lynched in the past before Not too pretty please This is the only thing holding back a lot of Digg users In France pd means gay  I was hoping Jeff is a salesperson Alas deleted Welcome Keep the design simplistic though The new mobile version is very nice Reddit blog yesterday Also weve hired a big guy named Vinnie to search and destroy the next person to make a search sucks selfpost Haha just kidding we cant afford to hire anyone Reddit blog today So were proud to announce that as of today were bringing him on as a design consultant and member of the staff So I have to ask is the poor broke reddit admin thing a shtick or what Maybe his second duty should be to sanitize his comment historyhttpwwwredditcomrIAmAcommentscsdqiamamanwhowasrapedbyafemalewhilefullycuwi now that hes on the payroll  Congratulations Jeff Hopefully your contributions will usher reddit to a new age of prosperity and structural integrity just like when a California Roll will melt if left in a prison for too long Good luck pal hope you enjoy it MAKE SHIT PRETTY MONKEY My name is Jeff so when I logged into Reddit and the top post on the front page was Welcome Jeff I was quite impressed Then I clicked the link and I feel like just a number again  Damnit deleted If it becomes pretty I want my money back I paid you guys to get a better personality not plastic surgery Trolled me hard with the reddit mockup I clicked thinking Hmmm this will be interesting I cant really think of much I would change just little things to cleanup I think the mockup is perfect  cant wait for this to go live My  donation is probably sitting in Jeffs pocket right now  as opposed to making templates and designs in Photoshop TIL PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO THIS WITH PHOTOSHOP Jeff the Paradox  Reflections and gradients CANNOT WAIT You can afford to bring someone on after getting a bunch of postcards and just two days of Reddit Gold being available as a subscription Now somethings not right here Jeff is httpimgurcomjBMjpg Jeff isnt wearing any pants Welcome Jeff well see what we can do about providing options for those of you who prefer it ugly But but but only dumb digg users think Reddit is ugly I personally think its the best designed site on the web Minimal design  not a bad thing In a site dedicated to text comments it makes sense that the space be optimized to show the most text on a page Honestly its great that youve hired another person  didnt you mention that you werent allowed to hire someone until you were in the green financially I dont know guys I kinda like the new design mockup instead of having to make the sketches in Photoshop and then convert them to CSS  HTML  Javascript he skips that whole first step He starts with CSS  HTML  Javascript and he ends with it Its like having a manual transmission on your website As a front end web dev I think this is the best way to design a website HEY JEFF JEFF I KNOW YOU ITS LAURA JEFF CAN YOU GET ME MORE KARMA Oh fuck it youre probably never going to see this at this point Congrats man Wow I bet that freaked out anyone named Jeff who joined reddit today Design Change Youll get over it Im a gold member and I demand animated gifs and gradients oooh live css any decent designer does live css PSD cutters arent real designers Jeff the God of Biscuits reddit represent Sweet now can we get someone to fix the mobileredditcom site so that it doesnt just crap out at the top  or so links D So this is what my donatiALL GLORY TO JEFF Cant complain about reddit mobile hours of fun in the offices bathroom Welcome JEFF Thanks for all the hard work so far on the mobile site cant wait for the refinements on the full site deleted Dear Jeff Why is RedditMobile still slower on my phone than normal reddit Xbox  Which games do you play Please keep it plain and ugly Even as a designer I kinda like that I demand to see this user distinguish himself as a reddit admin with the red username and the little A thingy Well I learned all of that stuff about  months too late Ill never have a sweet reddit job What the hell Jeff Youve been on the staff for nearly a day now Why isnt everything fixed yet He should do an iama Wow tough crowd Good luck Jeff My name is Jeff and I thought this post was all scripted and customized to post the viewers name So reddit cant afford to keep the servers up or to hire an engineer but it can afford to hire someone to make it look pretty hmmm nice to see where reddits priorities lie Loved your mobile layout Jeff Its awesome to see you got hired Enjoy the money and the fame man You deserve it You deserve it all  snif My name is Jeff  Is Jeff getting paid holly shit I know this man in real life Jeff smells of beef and cheese Who else didnt know about spredditcomhttpspredditcomindexhtml Do you mind if we call you Jeffro I think that would be amazing I could dress up like Ellie Mae and we could play Beverly Hillbillies No wait Please dont take away the monocolors from upvotes and the title bar They look so clean The tag maelstrom is ok I guess Im not a fan but I dont hate it Jeff was dropped twice as a babythe first time on Hiroshima and again on Nagasaki WHAT I TOLD YOU NO HIRING Jeff does most of his design  layout  testing in live CSS as opposed to making templates and designs in Photoshop Thats the only way to do it Photoshop doesnt work well for dynamic layouts Way to go Jeff On a side note Id be nice to see the whole layout a little tighter Less margins more padding But hey youre the pro Ill let you handle it deleted He be a cool dd This bodes well I demand a tag maelstrom As someone who donated to Reddit I feel I have to take it upon myself to speak for me and my fellow Goldmembers GET BACK TO WORK DAMNIT IM NOT PAYING YOU TO DRAW AVATARS I for one welcome our new Jeff overlord welcome to our new Conde Nast Overlord removed Jeff VaderhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvSviEKIEzw Welcome Jeff but please do not over Diggify this site most of us actually like the layout as it is and we can alter it using greasemonkey if we need to Maybe he can fix the mobile reddit so you can page down My almost never does limiting me to a handful of stories TAG MAELSTROM Haha Im looking forwards to the new layout This Jeff guy thinks he is hot shit with his telecommuting an strange hours Draw ME an avatar then Ill be impressedJeff Great Good luck on that job Jeff keep us updated about how it is to work with those strange people running reddit Now make me a bicycle clown Just kidding The mobile site was a nice addition Congrats Jeff Cant wait to see some of the projects youre working on Welcome to the internets Does this mean well get a new prettier reddit design Please keep the current one available under user preferences though reddit gold I like it  I cant wait to see some serious mockups I like the design as it is but it could use a little makeover Welcome Now GET TO WORK Hey Jeff Not new to Reddit I know but grats on getting a new job D deleted I for one welcome our new Jeff overlord Awesome the mobile sight is really cool Well if I knew you all needed a UI guy New blood is always good congrats I for one welcome our new designer overlord With all respect Jeff in our culture women are allowed to make their own decisions waynes world  Just one rounded corner and Im OUTTTA HERE Jeff is my middle name Welcome Jeff Cant wait to see these design changes I was so hoping that was a bubblerbowl in his hand My name is Jeff and I was a little freaked out when I saw this on the front page And I thought I was the only guy left who did all my web design in notepad My name is Jeff  I seriously thought for a good  seconds that this was a personal message to me In other news I are not bright EDIT And yes this account is older than the thread I shall watch this thread as it gets unnecessarily high influx of unnecessary comments Karma rush Noticing the  like this and the number of upvotes in only a few minutes and remembering the same thing happened yesterday with the new search announcement are the admins artificially inflating the number of votes from the get go in order to have their submissions appear on the front page immediately Seems to go against the spirit of Reddit I hope Jeff does something about this hiyo welcome jeff love the mobile site looking forward to seeing your stuff on here o Is it weird Im paying the income of a job I want but will never get What about that Intern Did that ever happen But currently reddit is short of cash  how do you pay Jeff God damnit I thought this was going to be about me for some stupid reason Probably because its the first thing I saw when I clicked onto reddit haha Makes no sense but I did Im somehow disappointed Mobile site looks great Thanks Welcome to the belly of the beast Is it just me or does Jeffs avatar look like Spock Hi Jeff Want to make me an avatar There should be a reddit avatar maker like the one for south park characters  And if there are any major changes well see what we can do about providing options for those of you who prefer it ugly Thank you I wish websites let you do this more often Am I the only Jeff who saw this and thought it was a new reddit gold feature just for me Although now that I think about it that makes no sense Do you need a professional upboater Hello everybody Hi Dr Nick Just promise us that youll allow us to choose between the current layout and the new layout when it happens My name is also Jeff and I joined yesterday I thought this post was for me Oh well D My name is Jeff and when I first saw this link at the top of Reddit it scared the crap out of me My name is Jeff I thought this was some sort of trick like that link to my facebook about a month back deleted OK Im afraid nowI like my reddit as I like my women  ugly Jeff  That name rings a bellhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvrLQZcjyuU I hope he adds more gradients Is it possible that this whole Jeff thing is in fact a virtual scapegoat for your future design decisions Lets call him Grandpa Jeffi  telecommutes most of the time  hah This wouldnt be Jeff from Seattle in the mid s who went by the nick Paradox at the time and hung out on EFNet would it That would be a scary small world Good job jeff D and welcome  Whats written on your shirt is weird if your read it the frenchs way Whoa for a second I thought you had a new feature which knows my real name  shit deleted You spelled Shawn wrong I recently was showing reddit off to this girl Ive been seeing She was like wow its so ugly I was like what no it isnt but deep inside I was left with the lingering doubt is reddit ugly I dont even see it as a website anymore Oh hey Sup Hey thanks for the welcome but all my friends all my Jef with  f for Fless Oh wait this is for someone else On the topic of the toolbar any chance that it can be made optional on iredditcom Not every mobile browser plays nice with it hovering there in the upper left corner Im Italian and I would like to speak on behalf of all Italians I approve this httpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddithttpreddit This could be fun deleted Whats this google thing Looks interesting Nice work raldi One reason why I stopped using the Reddit Toolbar is that it disabled the browser from resizing images down to fit within the screen space Has this been addressed As long as were mentioning the Reddit toolbar can you guys check out how the little popover works on the mobile version When I click a link and get the little blue thing with likedislike or whatever it doesnt let me scroll on my Android phone I have to close the thing to actually interact with the content of the linked page deleted I likeit Does anyone else just go to the browser and type re then enter Where did you acquire the domain from How much does an acquisition like that cost This isnt an AMA but Im curious deleted I started reading this post but then I gave up halfway through when I saw Ratmaze on the right Let me know how it ended I think I broke

On a more serious note shouldnt this be disallowed Ths is awsm On a semirelated note it would be super handy if I could turn the darn toolbar off in the compact view That toolbar does not obey the setting in preferences alas  Example httpiimgurcomOIqcxpng deleted And this is how I discovered the awesome Reddit Toolbar Thatsa tasty meataballs it  Im expecting Reddit  sotto pesante carico proprio ora and Sembra tu abbia rotto internet The shortlink in the scorebox to the right is a nice touch too Dude it is  AM in California Dont you people and by people I mean admins sleep Mi piace No offense guys but I think that rather than buying a it domain you guys should have spent the money on better servers so reddit doesnt go down for hours on end during Eastern Standard primetime Mamma Mia Now compare this straightforward usercentric announcement to the clusterfuck that was the Digg bar No wonder people prefer reddit This is pretty cool And I love the logo with the dropped dot of the i Its brilliant Although I get the Italy part but where does the soccer part come in I love the toolbar feature one change which Id like to suggest Some sites flickr twitter facebook and stackoverflow come to mind dont allow pages to be displayed within a frame so when you click on a link to any of those sites it causes problems Would you be able to maintain a list of these sites and not show the topbar for these sites httpreddithttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentseorhmredditlesstyping deleted butI dont use the reddit toolbar because when I have ad block off on your site and I visit another site with the reddit toolbar I get their very annoying ads Oh and most of the time I am not logged on because I want to view the default page not one taylored to my viewing habits who wants to see chipmunk prwn all the time Thank you for having the foresight to do this after finals week good sirs It doesnt work with flickr though httpreddithttpwwwflickrcomphotoscshimalaindateposted Except its much more typing if you want to go to the page referenced by the home page logo now Stupendo So then You guys are not moving in next to me here in Italy  The reddit URL prefix will be great when trying to get from an imgur link back to the reddit posting for it In that screenshot arrows say Likedislike Thats not how votes are described in the reddiquette typing reddit  ctrl  enter  typing reddit Its a lot more keystrokes in Chrome you have to manually type the http or you get a  Will reddit be more stable P Please buy redcom I accidentally go here all the damn time Hey nice site you have here It would be really a shame if something bad should happen to it I know everyone always applauds the admins for all the hard work they do but this is my favorite part about how reddit is run transparency You guys announce and explain every single change you make to the site and are flexible to withdraw or modify those changes based on the feedback from the community and I really appreciate that So thanks for making this an enjoyable little transparent corner of the internet Heres a thought This would be a user preference thats disabled by default When you click a submission title it loads in a new tab and goes to the reddit page but the reddit page looks for a cookie If that cookie is not set it sets the cookie and forwards to the actual submission Then in the new tab I can hit back and go back to the page of the submission If Ive got a habit of opening a pile of tabs before going through them then I can hit back on each tab for context I must say I really liked reddit toolbar but I had to disable it since reddit downtimeslowness impacted usability of that toolbar I click a bunch of links to open up in new tabs and reddit stalled those links by either not opening them or waiting forever for first contact with reddit servers The last protip doesnt really seem to work well So far what I got was  Forbidden  Request forbidden by administrative rules Or a page with just a toolbar with a completely irrelevant link Does the URL shortener take any steps to make sure that the short urls arent sucking the Googlejuice from the content they are linking to Adding the canonical meta to the header of the frameset will transfer the pagerank and whatnot to the original URL which I think would be the nice thing to do httpgooglewebmastercentralblogspotcomspecifyyourcanonicalhtml That Italian family at the next table sure is quiet Why is the short link in the sidebar in pt type Is it just me or is the most confusing thing ever I have no idea how I would use this One thing about the share link It sends to my friends with reddit as my reply address Sometimes they click reply thinking I will see what they say but it just goes into the presumably unmonitored reddit address It would be great if these shared links would have my verified email address as the replyto address reddit enter vs reddit ctrlenter old address is still faster  I know it looks funny but go with it Made me LOL Sorry redditcom tldr reddit Does Raldi  violentacrez Obligatory Inception Joke reddithttpwwwredditcom Isnt this exactly what digg did Hey it worked out so well over there amirite I like the name of your made up Hot new search engine at httpwwwgooglecom It has a neat name but lets be honest nothing with that name will ever take off Who types Home page and clicking baby shorter url let me just see what happens AhhhhhhhhhhhhttpimgurcomBnOi recursive addresses ftw Oh yet another abuse of a TLD Still feels like too much typingcan you make it shorter please Thanks The headline we really wanted to see before Christmas Reddit  less crashing To go to reddit i just press r and enter chrome ftw Does this mean youll make the links in the RSS feeds shorter too Change linkhttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentseorhmredditlesstypinglink to linkhttpredditeorhmlink Or guid isPermaLinktruehttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentseorhmredditlesstypingguid To guid isPermaLinktruehttpredditeorhmguid I too just bought a domain which is my name split in two pretty cool if I should say so myself I like the button that allows me to donate some monkeys To be honest they are loud smelly and reproducing like crazy around here and I cant wait to donate them to someone else While this is awesome and I now have the toolbar enabled because I like it typing reddit wont save me much time I dunno about you guys but I always use Ctrl  L  reddit  Ctrl  Enter After so many years of use Ctrl  Enter comes out faster than my brain can process me telling it to push it Any chance you could add a pixel or two to the font its tiny what never mind i dont want to know No this is  le I dont get what you said I see a great potential on the last paragraph Seems like a great way of exchanging information about a particular website previously visited by a member of the reddit comunity Awesome I upvoted google thanks to this If youre on an external site and you want to wrap the reddit toolbar around it you can just prepend reddit to the existing URL For example if youre visiting a hot new search engine at httpwwwgooglecom just change that to reddithttpwwwgooglecom I know it looks funny but go with it and youll be taken to the reddit page for that URL If its not already on reddit youll be taken to a prefilled submission page I dont get it W redd DOWNARROW ENTER Doesnt work with minecraftreddit I like doing minecraftredditcom cause its lot faster than doing the rmincraft at the end of the URL Your friend gets a link to the toolbar version and this way they can see the content the headline and should they desire to go exploring a way to get to the comments Ideally this will lead them to create an account and thus reddit moves one step closer to world domination Ive been trying this but no one joins My friends arent cool enough for reddit  Ideally this will lead them to create an account and thus reddit moves one step closer to world domination Sorry brother As a Freemason I have to inform you that we already have the world domination thing covered Well let you have the intarwebz but the world is ours This is sweet I send links to my friends all the time via txt and the shortlink for comment pages will make it a lot easier Thanks team reddit does this steal traffic from the sites the toolbar is wrapping URL shortener services are bad news for the longterm health of the web It creates an unreliable middleman layer that weakens one of the most important parts of the web hyperlinks Its a move towards centralization which is always bad Really websites that generate long URLs should be providing their own shortened URLshttpjoshuaschachterorgonurlshortenershtml eliminating the unreliable middleman  less copypasting FTFY oO  Redd from Italy is gonna get pissed Oh good The Digg toolbar went over very well too as I remember You know I actually found this domain by accident this weekend Working on a project I decided Id register reddit only to find it redirecting to redditcom  Now I wish I would have said something about it  Now if only Flickr would allow the page to be a in a frame ugh that is so annoying I updated my Google Chrome extension to use reddit for jumping to the toolbar version of a page httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailnffhdgbpbeampbakpbndkefncpcdiaac The website at redit just got a whole ton of extra views TIL Theres a toolbar Thanks How about we get some short URLs for subreddits so I dont have to type as many characters httpredditsubreddit would save three characters but if you could go a little bit further say make the short url for a subreddit the first few characters plus a few numbers to deal with matches httpredditsub would save  characters every time I had to type it For extreme matching cases you could increase the amount of numbers and decrease the amount of letters in the code Or you could go even shorter by only giving out short codes to reddits over a certain number of subscribers and making them sequential up from  rredditcom being the first reddit ever created and being over the subscriber threshold set which Im thinking would be no higher than  subs would become httpreddit Edit Im looking at this as a tool for subreddit mods who are promoting their reddits a lot from a regular user perspective most of these shortening schemes wont be incredibly helpful unless they are also displayed on the upperright corner of the subreddit Sweet domain hack brah slick All I do is type the letter r and the rest of redditcom autofills Any news on the missing compatibility between the reddit toolbar and viewing images in Google Chrome Specifically the issue is that images are shown fullsize when you have the toolbar enabled The only way to scale it down is to use the zoom function but that fucks up all future images you view so you have to readjust it every time Its been like this for quite some time which makes me sad because I would really like to use the reddit toolbar Too often do I forget the title of the link I clicked redit is going to wonder what caused the spike in their traffic Just clicked my first reddit link OMFG Off to surf the rest of interwebs while it loads  I for one welcome our new Italian overlords This will be good for falsely increasing traffic numbers just like the digg toolbar Anyone else read rnetsec and immediately thought of thishttpwwwredditcomtbeoigg submission from yesterday The part about sites setting up their own short urls being a bad idea because it makes the user start to trust any short url out there Anyways as a user of the toobar the submission links on my userpage still point to the old toolbar address and not the new short ones Why not acquire reddcom so reddit can become a rad social site  If youre on an external site and you want to wrap the reddit toolbar around it you can just prepend reddit to the existing URL For example if youre visiting a hot new search engine at httpwwwgooglecom just change that to reddithttpwwwgooglecom I know it looks funny but go with it and youll be taken to the reddit page for that URL If its not already on reddit youll be taken to a prefilled submission page By putting reddit infront of httpreddit getting the resulting resolved link and then putting reddit infront of that and repeating one can use this to regress reddit on itselfhttpiimgurcomfuNpepng Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately the regression seems to be removed if you actually try to submit the regressed link to reddit I wonder if it would be possible to use regression of reddit links to implement lambda functions and macros Bwah Hah Haw Haw Upvoted for the QA weve acquired the domain reddit How much did that set you back The Reddit community demands answers Now thats service I dont think it ever stopshttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomshttpwwwredditcomrannouncementscommentseorhmredditlesstyping All is forgiven This time unloading shotgun Great now what am I gonna do with all these pitchforks and torches The real tragedy here is that the flood of complaints displaced some extremely hilarious iPad jokes that might not get the attention they deserve Verizon has been making a lot of claims about having a bigger map out there But with ATT you get a big ad that covers half your screen I guess that settles it I work with DART I can easily see this happening and it has happened before Its understandable Very glad that is settlednow can we go back to spamming the new page with BREAKING NEWS JD SALINGER IS DEAD posts However blaming problems on a third party just isnt our style We take full responsibility for this failure and apologize profusely I do this too at work First extensively explain why something is entirely NOT YOUR FAULT but very much someone elses Then with the deepest voice you can muster go But I would not try to lay the responsibility somewhere else I truly deeply apologise The customer will love your attitude and will also be very aware that that bastard Will from the DB admin team is the one who did it mwahahaha To everyone bitching about turning off AdBlock you dont have to turn it off altogether  just click on the down arrow next to the ABP icon and select Disable on Redditcom Quit bitching  the site is free how else do you think businesses are able to stay up and keep running Unintended positive consequence  I actually had Adblock enabled for Reddit and didnt really think much of it but when I saw the onslaught of complains about the popover I turned it off so I could check out how bad it was for myself by then I think youd got rid of it because I never saw it Anyway now the storm has passed and Im all guilted into leaving Adblock off for redditcom If that was your plan all along then curses You guys are some classy SOBs and thats why I love it here How dare you take away reddits reason to be outraged I demand something about Israel to be posted immediately to compensate for this loss its weird cause i really want a blackberry now At least we know why apple hasnt enabled flash on its iPad Because ATT ads would slow the ATT G connection to a crawl You have an extra on in the title Wheres my twenty dollars I appreciate your wtfreactiontime Holy crap so that ad would actually be tolerated on some other site deleted Ok Adblock is off  Cause you asked nice Thanks for the response jedberg I figured it was too uncharacteristic of you and reddit Ok get rid of your streaming video adverts that play without any interaction and then Ill consider disabling adblock In the mean time go fuck yourself Your honesty and transparency as an organization is fantastic Keep up the good work So which is it  you take full responsibility or one of your advertisers decided to exploit you And this is why I love reddit Accountability For what its worth I disable ABP on reddit and didnt get the popover ad No excuses no second chancesyou scorched the retinas of my virgin eyes by making me look at a popout ad for a few seconds Never mind all the disguisting drivel Ive viewed on chanyou have verily violated my innocence Hang the reddit staff high from the rafters for this unforgivable and egregious error Save me O AdBlock Oh wait maybe I should get back to work Losers at least on on purpose Hello Reddit admins I had AdBlock on for every site including yours Thus I was not affected by the ad However the way you guys have handled this situation has impressed me I am now turning off AdBlock for Reddit You are the only site that gets this privilege Hopefully this will help offset the amount of Redditors that have undoubtedly turned AdBlock back on Look they fixed it they fixed it quickly they gave an explanation pretty much the did everything right Never saw the ad because of adblock But because of this apology Im going to allow ads for Reddit Ditch flash entirely and Ill whitelist at least its not the ipad As karmanaut predicted here is where I ask you to give us another chance and disable AdBlock for reddit OK but at the first sign of an animated ad Im reenabling it  However blaming problems on a third party just isnt our style  One of our advertisers decided to exploit us I see what you did there Personally I dont use adblock I do use noscript however so I never see the most annoying ads In fact theres an inverse relationship most of the time I see almost no ads at all on the worst offenders and I see every ad on sites that simple unobtrusive text ads The feedback that you might want to give Cond is that many of the people who spend more than say  hours a week on the internet eg present company have little tolerance for gaudy flashy intentionally annoying ads And if there was a user setting for say lowkey ads that eschewed flash and javascript for text and links many of us would be happy to provide impressions for these ads Heck some of us would even be willing to enable ad customization that uses the subreddits we have posted in to display targeted ads as long as you clearly tell us what information youre using The point you need to communicate to Cond is that most savvy internet users see them as fucking morons and they need to try to be a little smarter when it comes to trying to service that community Give the users what they want with a level of understanding that is appropriate to their tastes and they will cut you some slack Shove a turd down the throats of your users and they will gag and run Thanks for the quick response You guys rock Thanks for the quick reply man and the bad PR for ATT continues No problem man a lot of bitches on the internet They will cry at every opportunity This being one of them do you just read ALL comments on AL reddits feels uncomfortable knowing that jedberg is a stalker I work for a place that makes those kind of ads Isnt that horrible I cant think of a single other site where youd get this kind of apology Thanks Reddit Does anyone know how to allow ads on Reddit without having to mess with my adblocked hosts file The way you handled this little mistake made me turn off AdBlock for Reddit Since Ive installed Windows  recently I hadnt whitelisted reddit This reminded me I just officially and for the first time in my  years with reddit turned off my adblocker for reddit I just never thought to disable it before until I realized that people were doing it out of respect DART is run by Google Part of Doubleclick You should pay karmanaut For this inconvenience Im expecting my Redditing today to be free of charge In the interest of total disclosure Did you get any money from ATT out of this mistake Fear the wrath of our Internet Mob father Were growing stronger by the moment and we can not stand your pesterance You have been forewarned WE ARE REDDIT WE DONT FUCKING TORTURE As a web designer who has advertising on some of my sites I had this happen once before The cross scripting via java managed to flip my site to another NoScripthttpsaddonsmozillaorgenUSfirefoxaddon is better to use than Adblock It allows a site to have normal advertising in order to pay the bills but does a pretty good job at blocking the crossscript applications I dont know about everyone else but I never saw a fullpage ad on Reddit and probably because of NoScript Still I do see theyre normal ads in the box Adblock disabled for Reddit again I dont mind ads as long as they arent in the way I have adblock plus installed and after reading this post still have it installed All the attention about the ad is worth compared to that the talk of the gigantic iPhone was taking over This was just a ploy to get us all to turn off adblock Nice try reddit Nice try I still  reddit This is actually what I figured Ive seen similar things happen to other sites where advertisers try to take advantage of the host site You have my hits Thanks Holy balls that was a giant shitstorm in a span of like min whitelisted again Sorry about that reddit One of our advertisers decided to exploit us Weve shut the box ad for now However blaming problems on a third party just isnt our style We take full responsibility for this failure and apologize profusely mmmmmhm either way i still love you reddit  It was a third partys fault but we dont like to blame others so it was ours but really it was theirs If you turn AdBlock off HA HA HA OH WOWhttpiphotobucketcomalbumslChaosHAHAHAOHWOWjpg Thanks but AdBlock is on for a reason  and its on for all sites no exception I do appreciate reddits efforts you guys run a great site If you turn AdBlock off you will see Hah Nasty adminses tries to tricks us Im not disabling adblock because I hate ads even more than I hate freeloading Ha Ha Turn AdBlock off Good one Seeing as Drew Curtis was on here yesterday Im glad to know this isnt your way of pushing us to upgrade to TotalReddit This post is a perfect example of why I come to reddit Thanks jedberg ok guys put down the torches keep them handy but you can put them down for now I dont know Reddit That was half a lifetime ago Were different people now When you ran that ad the hurt was so deep I dont know if I can go through that again never blocked i knew there will be proper action with full brief  Thanks OK I forgive you Continue making money off of my limit attention span At least someone is Reddit is one of the few sites I have disabled adblock for Aw how could I not accept this apology deactivating Death Star superlaser screen shot humm Do we trust them Shit one more chance I guess Thanks for the quick action Reddit Overlords We overreacted We always overreact I wasnt worried All right everyone back into the pile Alright then switching from suck to blow Thank FSM The world was about to end there for a moment Its this responsiveness openness and acceptance of responsibility that keeps my respect for Reddit a division of the same Cond Nast which just loves to paginate the shit out of even outrageous and legally unenforceable copyright notices Would that other CN property sites try such attentiveness the company might see an increase in actual readership rather than the artificial numbers caused by stretching a word GQ article over seven pages Thanks for the explanation Bah DART are crappy Tangozebra rock my socks I once signed up for ads for a website from some broker I quickly told them to GTFO and never talk to me again Basically their ads were the same kind you get in your mailbox Viagra lotto winners and such stuff If only our politicians could be like you guys Here with Chrome running and I very rarely get any pop ups Never from Reddit If you are on Firefox and this is happening lol Well get over it Use Cajahttpcodegooglecompgooglecaja I will but only because you asked nicely Thanks for being a responsible site reddit Youre just lucky I was in meetings today THE KARMANAUT HATH SPOKEN Damnit and I got out my good lynchin rope too Oh I cant stay mad at you its no biggie dude chill Question Do you get paid for ads based on views clicks or purchases I have used reddit with adblock off for the longest time When you ask me to turn it off though thats where I feel heckled Turned it on and its staying on Theres no such thing as bad publicity They are still selling it I dint even see the ad WAKE UP SHEEPLE btw how do I get some of this premium ad space i click on a reddit story maybe once a month on popurls usually the tagline is more than enough since i am not a regular quipper what are potatoes i didnt see it at all so i still love you This didnt happen for me neither did the mouseypointyfloatyover hack last year I always miss these things When you guys took the announcements power I seem to remember something about how you would only use it rarely but Ive seen announcements at the top of my list  times in the last few weeks This page have adds Seriously I love my addblocker And If the Internet would have to go to a payperviewPeoplemakingthe webpagebecauseitfun type of style because they could not make money from adds I would be okay with that I hate Adds and see not reason to EVER have them and I will do anything I can to avoid seeing them multiple people have access to this Someone accidentally put in the wrong ad for the wrong site blaming problems on a third party just isnt our style I see Keep on on trucking No problem at all It was worth it to see people spazzing out without a moments thought reddit is the only site that I dont have blocked They asked nicely and I turned it off months ago well ok but dont do it again I cant reddit the current ad Is it broken How many clickthroughs are you getting on that ad space Based on the reaction of the users I cant imagine its a lot Removing name from The LIST dun dun DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN Fuck me you mean I have to call off the angry mobs Do you people know how expensive that is reddit does not run any kind of ads ever if you use adblock plus and noscript FTFY I dont use AdBlock I also dont click ads Not really sure where that leaves us well I missed work today and Ive already called in sick ahead of time for tomorrow it was just too much it really was Dont you guys see it Apple did this So youd stop talking about their iPad i missed it and i dont get to join in with the outrage could this be arranged to happen again at a certain time we could all get together and dress up as witch hunters or something Be outraged take screenshots and upload to imgur REALLY fast and things maybe afterwards we could get some tea please really missing out here Have the people responsible for sacking the people responsible been sacked If you turn AdBlock off Nice try Conde Nast Question Have you considered changing to Project Wonderfulhttpwwwprojectwonderfulcom ads Developed by Ryan North of Dinosaur Comics I dont block ads and this is a great project that might work here Reddit is run by good people   I do not use adblock and did not see the ATT ad but I appreciate reddits dedication to minimalist advertising ITs understandable to need advertising to keep the site up just keep it from getting in the way of the real content Love ya reddit I just learned today because of said incident about the effect AdBlocker has on this site Glad to see this addressed and Im more than happy to take it off for this site Keep it up Reddit Its an option the person who did your ads needs to disable Simple for them to do actually So unless someone mislabels an ad it wont happen  I had adblockplus up this whole time However due to seeing how quickly Reddit Admins handled the popup fiasco I think it its definitely worth supporting Reddit by adding them to my whitelist Congrats Reddit your the first will probably be the only website that I deem whitelist worthy Without the fiasco I would never have thought about whitelisting this site Every cloud has a silver lining Thank you reddit This is why u respect this site so much Keep doing your thing and we will keep doing ours Ive never seen a popup for years Most modern browsers block them and I also have NoScript and AdBlock which are quite popular It hadnt occurred to me that I should disable AdBlock on what has become my favorite website to mindlessly stare at for hours all day every day for the last couple of days until this happened Adblock disabled i love you reddit Whats with all the haters downvoting this There is nothing uglier than nerdonnerd rage Puts done the feathers tar and glitter What When youre going to string someone up you might as well do it in style darn I missed all the excitements  why dont you guys apologize by making reddit free for a month or so I read this as reddit does not run over pop ads at least on purpose You all forget that Digg does have ads much bigger than this The whole front of digg is an ad for McDonalds you might even check the address bar to make sure you did not go to McDonaldscom I have disabled adblock for Reddit thanks to this honest mistake on their part It had never crossed my mind to disable it before but after the pop up fiasco I can see that Reddit is a site that really cares about their viewers and I want to do all I can to support them OH MY GOD THE SPELLING ERROR OH HOW IT DOES BURN SO MUCH LIKE A THOUSAND POP UPS ON ON MY SOUL ON ON MY VERY SOOOUUUUL I just disable my adblock due to this post Thanks to reddit team for the responsibility on ads I left Digg because of their sites ads layout Its a drill Youve all done very well You could have at least used a model m to dispatch that admin Give a man some dignity in his final moments Plus it would make a cleaner kill over that pathetically weak apple keyboard httpvideogooglecomvideoplaydocidhlen Thanks for being on top of that I wont even go to websites that have popover ads If you guys start doing that Ill be gone in a flash DARThttpwwwdoubleclickcomproductsdfaindexaspx IS Doubleclick Understanding the consumerDFAs sophisticated targeting ensures your ads reach the right audience o   begin the bludgeoning Kudos and thanks Jed  AtT the worst of capitalism AND communism  From experience guys DART is a fucking piece of shit We use it at Clearchannel too deleted So what happened We do not actually control the ad box on the right  that is outsourced to a company called DART We share an account with the rest of Conde so multiple people have access to this Someone accidentally put in the wrong ad for the wrong site and you saw the result However blaming problems on a third party just isnt our style   DART  doubleclick Right AdBlockPlus  On People actually turn ad block off My adblock is disabled For Reddit at least Thanks for a prompt honest and sincere response And really no harm done I mean seriously now youd think you just irreparably blinded half the reddit userbase with the uproar I actually forgot I still had AdBlock on for this site I used to have it off but forgot to disable it after getting a new computer and reinstalling firefox and AdBlock Turning it off now the quick response is appreciated Reddit has ads Im on a mac and havent seen one of these socalled popups all day How can I disable adblock for specific sites ie reddit on chrome I would love to support sites with noninvasive ads reddit does not run popover ads at least on on purpose You should run this as a popup for irony Here is a thought take the massive outcry from what has to arguably be your most sought after demographic and show the other Conde sites and say We should consider getting rid of all pop up ads everywhere regardless of their profitability in the short term You had a nice slice of that golden demographic actually turning off adblock intentionally to support you and you have damaged that relationship potentially irreparably Some of us may never get around to whitelisting Reddit again simply because it is too much to bother with that setting a second time deleted The new comment feature is going to feel like its saving me time while really taking up loads of my time as I obsessively check back to see the new comments Tomorrows logo better be a terrified elephant Its not working for me Sent from my iPad The comments highlight is one feature I might just get reddit gold for Nicely done guys Awesome to see how you guys are managing reddit gold Wth Why is there a reddit logo underneath the mouse I dont need Reddit Gold to prove Im better than everyone else everything is going better than expected Yo dawg we put a mouse over your mouseover to the reddit logo so you can mouseover the mouse over the reddit logo to read about it while you reddit I didnt realize raldi posted this And so I thought It kinda tells you you fucking idiot Reddit Gold is shaping up to be an excellent idea after the original outrage Kudos to the Reddit team Despite all the complaints over reddit gold these feature rollouts are showing how it really benefits everyone and not just gold members Thanks deleted Is the reddit alien holding the arrow and clicking himself By the way love the new gold feature of highlighting new comments on a previously viewed thread That highlighter code seems a little inefficient What about this function highlightnewcommentsperiod  newcommentremoveClassnewcomment ifperiod   return forvar i  period i   i  commentperiod  iaddClassnewcomment   That saves having to iterate over the lower numbers and all the higher numbers when period   The comment highlighting is awesome Thanks Okay so the cursor over the logo is an arrow cursor but as the image is a link when you scroll over it you actually get the hand pointer cursor You put it there you should know Its great to see stuff rolling out so quickly Thanks Way to overestimate my reading speed reddit  It looks like Snoo is enjoying a delicious Apple pointer pop  This one actually didnt mean anything We changed the mouseover text throughout the day so that goldmembers would be just as confused as everyone else Dammit I remember being confused after reading that title text but I just convinced myself that it actually made sense Thanks for that I was wondering about the Brunei logo and the communist pirate with anaconda I was suggesting this feature some years ago Finally this is here Well played Reddit Yeah thats totally something I would pay for Best new feature thus far REDDIT GOLD IS RUINING THIS WEBSITE RABBLERABBLERABBLE Wait whats that Oh I see That mouse is from motherfuckin Rodents Revenge I thought you were going to embed a flash version of the game on the front page  erry day edit For those who havent educate yourselves fun gamehttpwwwpcgamingwsviewgamephpgamerodentsrevenge Comment highlights are a great idea Is there going to be a way to tab through the new responses I dont know if youve ever seen SBNations blog sites theyre sports blogs so probably not lololol sigh but they have a commenting system that lists new comments in gold and they have keys to navigate through them  C for the next new comment X to mark a comment read Z to mark a comment read and move to the next new comment and ShiftA to mark all comments read It is a truly excellent system and it would be awesome to see something like that on reddit That new comment feature is going to be awesome I cant wait til I can pay you guys for gold I really love the comments ting thanks reddit Can I also just say that my shiny new reddit widget on my shiny new android phone is very very awesome indeed You guys are awesome Thank you very much admins its about time The comment highlights feature is awesome Ive been begging for it for years Now reddit is officially a better engine than scoop in every possible way  This one actually didnt mean anything We changed the mouseover text throughout the day so that goldmembers would be just as confused as everyone else Did you just call all the paying subscribers penises Hell YES I love the new feature FINALLY The threadremembering feature is the coolest thing added until now  Good job Oh you bastards Now I want gold HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK I like the civil engineering guy because Im a civil engineer MaudDib Heres a feature I didnt know about I went to redditcomrquitsmokinghttpredditcomrquitsmoking and something strange happened Is that a new feature or was that something someone else set up God I just realized that this is a pun and now I hate it It reminded me of rodents revenge I felt a nostalgic so I googled it here is a link I played for a good mins httpreynoldssoftcomrodentgamerodentapplethtm At the risk of sounding like Jemery Clarkson A mouseover How hard could it be Wow A simple code put into the logo html after so many years And it took so much money to do HOLY SHIT This is a feature Id never think of asking for But I get the feeling I will be unable to live without it Now I know what the whole world felt like when Henry Ford invented the car Hopefully we can get tooltips for user page trophy case items soon What the heck does WellRounded even mean is there any way the comment highlighting could be less ugly that green is rather hideous How about allowing unicode usernames and usernames longer than  characters This is one of the only features Ive actually been waiting for Thanks guys keep up the good work This highlighting is AWESOME love it I love you guys As a gold member I like that I get a beta of new features but Im even more excited to see these features opened up to the reddit population I knew you guys would do right by your users Sweet so being a regular member is just like being a gold member last week I can handle living a week in the past my only question was how hard was it really to invest in alt text Isnt this just adding the title tag the the url Sorry for being a bit ignorant but why did it need to be tested in Reddit Gold before implementing it Does anyone know why two of the reddit avatars from the blog page are faded Do they no longer work therehere Great now I dont have to go into the IRC or ask anyone in the subreddits about why the logo has changed I bet you  that someone will still submit a reddit asking about the mouse new logos etc I hoping the mouse was coming to reddit to figure out what the meaning of Life the Universe and Everything yer prefrences be updated arrr FYI it took me longer than  seconds to figure it all out It took me about  seconds to read Please adjust your text accordingly Oh man I hope AlienBlue adds comment highlighting in the next version RATMAZEhttpwwwpixeljamcomratmaze  Release the Cats So what were all the different mouseover texts for Friday The reddit alien is alsoholding the Mac mouse icon  Black with a white border this makes me happy  if you encounter a good thread while youre at work you can pull out your phone on the train ride home and check whats new Then when youre sitting in bed with your laptop later that night you can see what you missed when you were washing the dishes That explains why Ive been having these feelings of being watched YOU have been watching where I do my redditingparanoidmode I think the mouse is there bc there is a mouse in my house Stupid cat didnt kill it last night So who else had a problem with the mouse over on the example logos inside the blog post Bit miffed I missed a Thomas Telford nod on Reddit as Im from the English town that bears his name although this may be the first time Ive ever felt genuine affection for it Let me begin and ctrlf hasnt been learned bythis new user of an htc phone Ill get there mouseover get it Hell its about time I honestly read the title as Why is there a mosque over the reddit logo  Oh Why is there a mouse over the reddit logo A Mouse over Mouse over Ray Charles could see what you did there Ganesh What is smooshing technology how soon till this is posted on Digg There is a bug with the feature Not sure if it has been reported though I wouldnt be surprised if it has Highlighting doesnt work until the show nnn comments is toggled at least once Here is a screenshot demonstrating the issue httpiimgurcomjYCOkpng After selecting either show  or the gold option show all nnn highlighting then works For the new comment feature Id sign up for Reddit Gold  but only if it would be extended to at least  hours  so I can catch up with everything on Monday  Bombshell actress Hedy Lamarr coinvented frequency hopping the basis of modern WiFi WiFi doesnt use frequency hopping Why do you ask The mouse has been there for years I feel bad It took me more than  seconds to read the tooltip  seconds How slow do you think my browser is Wow tooltips Thats fucking great Now fix the user pages  As one reddit gold feature rolls out another rolls in Gold subscribers can now see which comments were added since their last visit to a particular thread It looks like this That sounds like such a massively useful feature Id consider PAYING for that feature in my reddit DAMN Comment highlighting is awful It slowed FF down to a crawl Every time I opened a large thread of comments it became unresponsive I had to disable it So Reddit Gold is just adding best practice to normal Reddit Hey it only took  years I feel left out Its High school all over again Awww I cant be involved in Reddit April fools this year because I dont have any Reddit friends   April st The day of the year the internet goes full retard bunch of mold diggers TBH Its not really a cool april fools prank if only an X amount of redditors get the spores I feel a lil disappointed that the only way I get to participate now because really did the admins go through xxx comments in that thread is by paying up Which I dont mindbut still homies  Think of the homies Im so glad this mold thing isnt actually doing anything annoying with my browsing habits Just think about how obnoxious and frustrating this April Fools Day would grow if this prank could stop you from posting candidly  by say banning you from using a vital word or symbol in your submissions So many hilarious linguistic roadblocks But it looks as if all of us can look forward to communicating without worry tomorrow deleted httpiimgurcomjBhDjpg H crap I think you had to be somewhat notorious to get mold I didnt get any Im not sure yet whether to be happy or miffed  deleted mph Right now I see IRAPECATS at  while jedberg is at  On another note does this mean well be seeing a lot of Unicode today I want some mold sigh just another way to feel like I was picked last for gym class  deleted What is this about not bing abl to us th lttr  Guess what Im pregnant What a stupid fucking idia deleted Should any man hint at a want to rid said account of mold I shall cast an arrow of down Post Script  I do not miss anything and am happy with my supply of consonants I find writing in such form surprisingly basic if you must ask my opinion Slime molds are organisms in two taxonomic groups the cellular slime molds Phylum Acrasiomycota and the plasmodial slime molds Phylum Myxomycota Organisms in both groups are eukaryotic meaning that their cells have nuclei and are funguslike in appearance during part of their life cycle For this reason they were traditionally included in mycology textbooks However modern biologists consider both groups to be only distantly related to the fungi  The two groups of slime molds are considered separately below Species in the cellular slime mold group are microscopic during most stages of their life cycle when they exist as haploid having one copy of each chromosome in the nucleus  singlecelled amoebas The amoebas typically feed on bacteria by engulfing them in a process known as phagocytosis  and they reproduce by mitosis and fission Sexual reproduction occurs but is uncommon Most of what we know about this group is from study of the species Dictyostelium discoideum When there is a shortage of food the individual haploid amoebas of a cellular slime mold aggregate into a mass of cells called a pseudoplasmodium A pseudoplasmodium typically contains many thousands of individual cells In contrast to the plasmodial slime molds the individual cells in a pseudoplasmodium maintain their own plasma membranes during aggregation The migrating amoebas often form beautiful aggregation patterns which change form over time After a pseudoplasmodium has formed the amoebas continue to aggregate until they form a mound on the ground surface Then the mound elongates into a slug The slug is typically less than  in  mm in length and migrates in response to heat light and other environmental stimuli The slug then develops into a sporocarp a fruiting body with cells specialized for different functions A sporocarp typically contains about  cells The sporocarp of Dictyostelium is about  in  mm tall and has cells in a base stalk and balllike cap The cells in the cap develop into asexual reproductive spores which germinate to form new amoebas The different species of cellular slime molds are distinguished by sporocarp morphology Dictyostelium discoideum has been favored by many biologists as a model organism for studies of development biochemistry  and genetics Aspects of its development are analogous to that of higher organisms in that a mass of undifferentiated cells develops into a multicellular organism with different cells specialized for different functions The development of Dictyostelium is much easier to study in the laboratory than is the development of higher organisms A food shortage induces aggregation in Dictyostelium In aggregation individual amoebas near the center of a group of amoebas secrete pulses of cAMP cyclic adenosinemonophosphate The cAMP binds to special receptors on the plasma membranes of nearby amoebas causing the cells to move toward the cAMP source for about a minute Then these amoebas stop moving and in turn secrete cAMP to induce other more distant amoebas to move toward the developing aggregation This process continues until a large undifferentiated mass of cells the pseudoplasmodium is formed Interestingly cAMP is also found in higher organisms including humans In Dictyostelium and these higher organisms cAMP activates various biochemical pathways and is synthesized in response to hormones neurotransmitters and other stimuli The plasmodial slime molds are relatively common in temperate regions and can be found living on decaying plant matter There are about  different species Depending on the species the color of the amorphous cell mass the plasmodium  can be red yellow brown orange green or other colors The color of the plasmodium and the morphology of the reproductive body the sporocarp are used to identify the different species The plasmodial slime molds are superficially similar to the cellular slime molds Both have a haploid amoeba phase in when cells feed by phagocytosis followed by a phase with a large amorphous cell mass and then a reproductive phase with a stalked fruiting body However the plasmodial slime molds are distinguished from the cellular slime molds by several unique features of their life cycle First the germinating spores produce flagellated as well as unflagellated cells Second two separate haploid cells fuse to produce a zygote with a diploid nucleus Third the zygote develops into a plasmodium which typically contains many thousands of diploid nuclei all surrounded by a continuous plasma membrane The cytoplasm of the plasmodium moves about within the cell a process known as cytoplasmic streaming This is readily visible with a microscope  The function of cytoplasmic streaming is presumably to move nutrients about within the giant cell In nature plasmodial slime molds grow well in wet and humid environments and under such conditions the plasmodium of some species can be quite large After a particularly wet spring in Texas in  several residents of a Dallas suburb reported a large moving slimy mass which they termed the Blob One reporter in the local press speculated that the Blob was a mutant bacterium able to take over the earth Fortunately a local mycologist soberly identified the Blob as Fuligo septica a species of plasmodial slime mold Another plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum is easily grown in the laboratory and is often used by biologists as a model organism for studies of cytoplasmic streaming biochemistry and cytology The plasmodium of this species moves in response to various stimuli including ultraviolet and blue light The proteins actin and myosin are involved in this movement Interestingly actin and myosin also control the movement of muscles in higher organisms including humans I think that reddit should give people trophies who gave it away but remain disease free Wll httpwwwbloggercomoopsweforgottochangethis doesnt seem to be

DONT MOLD MEH BREEEH Much better than iReddit for iPhone Very kickass for the first public iteration edit for spelling Hmmm although the old mobile site was not very user friendly this right herehttpiimgurcomxmWTjpg is downright impossible to use Im guessing the Blackberry browser doesnt support some of the tech youre using How do I browse reddit now while commuting Holy shit its usable If my coworkers thought my shits took a long time before wait till they see what happens now Now I can reddit and drive even easier deleted I found some issues Infinite scrolling is nice but if you click a link then hit back Reddit reloads and you have to infinitely scroll all over again on iPad Infinite scrolling doesnt seem to work at all on the Palm Pre This could be a network issue or something though The toolbar thing prevents YouTube links from being opened by the YouTube app on both Pre and iPad Good work so far though Thanks for adressing concerns ith iPhone app Im very happy with just having a mobile site even if I did pay for the app haha Keep up the good work We appreciate the open dialouge Letting you know what I think  looks great  Cant find the option to save submissions to view later I dont wanna view some bigass imagehttpwwwouramazingplanetcominfographictallestmountaintodeepestoceantrench on my phone but Id like to save it so that I can view it from my computer when I log in later Youre welcome everyone Now this is a mobile version of reddit P I dont know how well the site is optimized for Opera Mini which is what I use on my shitty phone but it kinda sucks  Theres less information than in the previous version I dont know if its because the fonts seem bigger  The top titlebar is truncated over the hotsaveetc bar  The fonts colours used for the Options and that other number above it just realized its for comments look like embossed text on my phone Really difficult to read When I logged on to reddit I thought itd been hacked  The votingoptionscomments buttons are much too large Theyre obstructing some subreddit name in some cases  Everything is way too large on the comment page Plus horizontal scrollings not available which means that all the text becomes bunched up The old versions comment page was better Despite this its got some potential and I think Im gonna like what it becomes Very cool Probably wont use redditisfun any longer on Android This interface is much nicer and has full functionality Hey Admins the URL appears to be case sensitive iredditcom  mobile site Iredditcom  redditcomrI IRedditcom  redditcom home page I cant seem to find the hide button for articles Thanks Looks great on my Palm Pre Not sure if it has been mentioned yet but is there an option to only show the first couple replies to a post The one thing I hate doing while browsing on my phone is scrolling endlessly passed the first post because of all of the replies Im aware that theres the collapse feature but it would just be nice to see the original post and a couple of the top rated replies and if I wanted to see more then I could click a button and expand it Wow this looks great The page is quite slow on my  Milestone though running at  MHz BRAVO Thank you to everyone who worked on this A lot of us have been waiting expectantly since the first screenshots were released The down arrow button in the top right doesnt do anything for me in mobile safari I hope login option is there because i had to click saved to get asked to login Needs a fav icon specific to iphones Not sure how that works Also there arent and never were scrollbars on this comment textarea Its tough to scroll to the top of my comment while editing I blame the missing arrow keys on the iphone keyboard but maybe theres some way to clean up scrolling Even a texarea which grows Otherwise this is awesome Why is this still showing up in todays top links Geckobased browser support would be much appreciated for those using browsers such as MicroB or Mozillas own Fennec browser The updown vote arrows arent showing properly Also the white text on the buttons is hard to read I had very similar results with both of these browsers on my Nokia N It looks the same using the standard Firefox  in Ubuntu  Just checked it out on my Android phone in the default browser It looks pretty damn awesome and Ill be using it alongside reddit is fun  Brilliant design paradox If I had any gripes itd be that it needs more orangered Good work its working very well on my Nexus One Of course the iPhonelike Design ist somewhat annoying but its Ok There is only one big thing for me the Icons are a little bit too small on a HighResDisplay Its hard to touch them maybe you think about this because the iPhone also comes with HighResDisplay What is the Options button supposed to do Nexus One Android  Dolphin Browser not HD It doesnt seem to do anything Nexus One  Android  Browser A popup appears When I press one of the choices it presses a linkbutton behind the popup infinite scrolling would be nice in rpics for the desktop version of reddit just sayin deleted Is this revamp only for touch screen phones It looks terrible on my Blackberry Tour and now of the margins are formatted properly Or am I doing something wrong Prepare yourself to Facepalm but how do I use this new amazing reddit Im on my phone now and everything looks the same as it did before Palm Pre here Overall looks great Much easier to navigate with fingers The floating toolbar works great on WebOS The bad Not only does infinite scrolling not work but theres no way to go to the next page of links Can only see the first N or so posts with no way to go to the next ones Also I miss the little extra bit of info that shows the domain that the post points to ie the little bit where it says imgurcom or cnncom or selfredditcom etc First off im on mobile safari  My open links in new windows setting doesnt seem to work in this interface  I dont like the reddit bar at the top of nonreddit pages for links that i click Yesss Awesome One thing though You guys need an appletouchicon for when people add it to the home screen I am afraid to report that the new site is very buggy and slow for me Whenever I scroll down the all links become blurry and the site is completely unreadable Sorry I cannot provide a screen shot at this time but I will update when I get home I use the default browser that comes with the Nokia E I browse mredditcom daily on my phone and I have never had this problem Really Fuck yea I use the mobile site all the time Thanks looks good on my  Symbian Looks great I love the comments Two problems on my N though  When opening any link the actually page will be displayed in a VERY small frame at the top of the page screenshot from PC but same on phonehttpimgurcomRBsykjpg  A lot of phones have touch screens why waste all that lovely space when it could be used to make big buttons Heres my best mockuphttpiimgurcomUBXcpng If you could fix these it would be perfect I honestly think it looks great Great job reddit Edit I dont know why I just referred to the developers as reddit I am using the old mobile site quite a lot I dont have a smartphone but a pretty capable regular phone Sony Ericsson W The old mobile site is better than this one for that phone The main problem with the old site is that some links leads to the regular site and that the description of the title in self posts isnt shown And it is hard to find subreddits to browse to So the old mredditcom is great I like it a lot deleted So this will make it easier to view the MILF of the year and Keanu Reeves while on the move Upvote and downvote arrows dont display on opera  on HTC Touch pro running Windows Mobile  Not working right on MicroB Firefox  based V  on the N httpwwwimgurcomMhtZIjpg Works awesomely on opera mobile yay Thank you I never wanted an iPhone app since the purpose of reddit was typically to go to web pages This is much preferred and fast to boot Ugh I was a frequent mobile reddit user even reported a few problems but I gave up because of the issues Anyway on my WebKit based browser on Nokia E which many redditors use the three choices arent even visible It looks like when I go with Opera on my PC just empty boxes Heres a screenshot of what happens when I scroll after choosing the new interface httpimgurcomUBNLO can I sign in with my fucking blackberry now Very nice but any chance of redirecting automatically from wwwredditcom based upon a user agent check That would be handy when following links from the rss feed on an iPhone Thanks very much  this was really needed I really wish it didnt look like an iPhone app seriously I cant stand this trend in mobile sites but who am I to complain Im actually thinking of using this as my main page on my computer hmmm This looks great but i have a suggestion add more space between the threaded comment boxes Just a few pixels Its hard to quickly tell which threads are replies and such Other than that it looks and works awesome I feel like the main site could borrow a couple things from this Great job it looks fantastic I dont like the fact that links open with the toolbar on top and not as normal links Could that be made configurable Commenting from my phone because I can This is le nice i know my phone is old but why is it slower than the standard desktop version when viewed on my G running Android  Using Opera Mini   on an HTC Touch Windows Mobile and it looks terrible the new mobile site looks great on webOS but hey the native homebrew Preddit app for webOS is opensource too How can WebKit make it look so much different than in eg Firefox Im flabergasted Maybe Im being stupid But why does every link I click in when Im in the icon I added to the home screen open up a different instance of Safari wwwredditcom is not redirecting to wwwrredditcom shouldnt it be automatic I am using a sprint katana by sanyo Posted here as well httpwwwredditcomrIAmAcommentscdrqiamadeveloperontheredditmobilewebappamacrrkr My only visual problem so far is that there is way too much blue Blue buttons every other row has blue link on blue background Maybe add more contrast otherwise it looks great Also add more padding for each row as the option and vote number between  rows is a little too close to me Would be nice to differentiate the amount of upvotes and the options button a little They are essentially the same which draws no focus Same with the show text aA button Im a little confused I saved Iredditcom to my iPhone home page and when I click it it opens as if its an ap but then when I click anything it closes the ap and opens it in safari So then when Im done looking at the link or comments I have to close safari and open the ap again which takes a second to load The only reason why I saved it to my home page anyway was so it would just open it in safari Whats going on Why does it open as I its an ap Thanks Cant type in the password field on a Nexus One which means I cant login which renders the whole thing moot It lags on a ghz phone while scrolling The android app reddit is fun is far superior Yes yes yes Palm users still exist as WebOS woohoo Finally we Palm addicts got a mention  Why is the mobile site better looking than the actual site This makes little sense Looks better than the standard version of reddit interestingly a new free reddit app was just released a week or two ago on the app store  Alien Bluehttpwwwalienbluecom its pretty nice if youre on any of the apple iProducts  a long way ahead of iReddit  the old mobile site comparable with the new mobile site so probably good for the hardcore redditers who want a separate app so they dont get distracted into procrastination by all those other sites while browsing reddit for my money ie none since both are free i prefer the toolbar provided in the Alien Blue app ie for votessaveshidescomments to the one in the new mobile site which is a fixed size and renders with the page so wide pages make it tiny I tried to reply to a comment but because its almost impossible to press the reply button without pressing the whole comment I decided to do it like this This actually sums up my complain same goes for for the arrows and other buttuns This is from mobile opera  Android It doesnt have pinch and zoom Dolphin does so this isnt a problem there  I found the link on the web so I tried it from the smartphone I got the link to the blog which took me to the link on the web I found the mobile site but couldnt comment about it from the mobile site so I got back on the notebook and sent you this note About how I couldnt send the note from the mobile site I found the link on the web so I tried it on the smartphone It is terrible Ability to see comments and save links for later were the only reason I was visiting reddit from mobile phone Now that this ability is gone theres absolutely no reason why I would visit mobile version again Itd be nice if this would still show the domain of the submitted link I tend to avoid clicking anything from youtubecom on my phone as I dont want to be billed for streaming lots of MB iPhone user using iredditcom Dont mind the small icons or whatever but Loose the toolbar Its awful It doesnt work well at all And its nigh on impossible to get rid of which then just causes the bloody page to reload Stupid Id recommend getting rid of the spinning reddit head when you load new posts scroll to the bottom of the page It is very irritating to look at A few things I notice on my droid running Dolphin Browser HD  The upboats and downboats are rendered weird That is the most technical term I could think of It might be beneficial to utilize something like what Reddit is Fun uses Where you click the link it gives you options to upboat downboat link or comment  The buttons borders do not go all the way around the buttons in every instance  The color scheme is great All in all it is a huge improvement Thank you very much Replying now from my ipod touch Definitely better than ireddit Good work The load more comments button on the mobile site looks absolutely massive in Chrome I hope its not on the phones because it happens multiple times per page  httpwwwbtacrationcoukdatatiffcdffabadeebbuttstiff Its missing a link relicon sizesany hrefstaticcompactredditmobilesvg and multiple bitmaps for iOS and Safari as Im pretty certain they dont support SVG icons link relicon sizesx hrefstaticcompactredditmobilepng etc Android has always supported this and I think iOS has for a while too appletouchicon is nonstandard and outdated though Android does support it for now for backwards compatibility If youre wondering this icon stuff is defined in the HTML spec Not to mention that the URLs themselves are to some password protected site Edit All of the buttons are looking nonantialiased on my Nexus One running Froyo Most phone browsers arent actually webkit based Some graceful degradation would have been nice  Theres been a lot of discussion about our lack of updates on our iPhone app and we have a secret to tell you we really really hate having to deal with the App store This does not excuse you for the utter lack of an Android app According to their subreddits there are more Android lovers on this site than there are iPhone lovers My iPhone thanks you so does my now terrible vision It appears to come up with strange font colors in the Opera iPhone browser I prefer the aesthetics of redditisfun which is closer to the main site OO But this has more functionality Finally this is great news Now we dont even need a Blackberryapp anymore I get blank images using Blackberry  v you look like youre on a modern browser Here are some choices Blank Blank Blank Selecting home then brings up the stories but with blank what i assume is suppose to be up and down arrows Edit But thanks for the effort Holy crap this looks great Thanks for this I might have to retire redditisfun if this is worthwhile Sorry redditisfun  Edit It is slower than the app but it still looks really cool As for the poop jokes and racy images in the context of the iphone app couldnt you just have it default to rannouncements when first installed I wont be using the app any longer now that the mobile site kicks ass but it was just a thought  Since meta nameapplemobilewebappcapable contentyes  doesnt work could you remove it from the code That way adding the icon to ones iPhone home screen will just act as a link and not a web app The very first thing I did before logging in even was add it to my home screen right next to iReddit I was slightly confused by the lets jump to Safari part until I read the blog post Also Thanks Nice Now I dont feel so bad about neglecting the Reddit WebOS app I made Youre still using jQuery which is too large to cache on the iPhone If you could replace jQuery with standard JS then you will get faster loading pages Its beautiful The search was a bit off though I couldnt choose sort order Bookmarked and my new iReddit  now I dont have to use telescope to upvote Stuff The menu button icon on a postcomment looks too much like a disclosure triangle Id expect it to collapse the thread not show me options It looks like theres something wonky going on with the event listeners If I tap a list item the whole screen highlights to provide tap feedback It should instead highlight the item I tapped The buttons on the items comment count link text entry etc seem to highlight properly It bums me out that the EVO browser does such a shitty job rendering the CSS styles I would have expected them to be nicely antialiased vectors These looks like lowres GIFs Not working so well on the Nuron  S or it works well and I just dont like the design Either way it looks really different from what I suspect it should does not look very awesome on opera mobile not opera mini on winmo  nontouchscreen phone  htc dash g Holy crap TIL  Theres a mobile reddit site  It was revamped No more squinting for me I cant speak to your mobile site but I have to say that the regular site has become REALLY slow lately  no its not me I can get to other sites with no issues and I have a Mbs download pipe The system often times out if I click on the envelope to see mail Oh because well tell you anyway I get it Heh Yay Now it doesnt really suck Thanks It is pick some high percentage better Easy to read on the droid compared to how it used to be nice work Great news and well done Just one question though Why is it that when mobile operating systems and apps for them are discussed  the leading mobile OS is always omitted for some reason  of all smartphones sold last year are running Symbian yet all we ever hear is iPhone this Android that Blackberry this Palm that Just irks me Edit Statistics to back up my claimhttpgigaomcomthemobileosmarket The thing Id like to see the most on the app is the ability to be able to post submissions to different subreddits from the phone itself The other day I really wanted to ask a question in rMarijuana by post and I found I could not Can this be an update during the next goround Using Blackberry Opera  I found  to way too clunky and slow I cannot use the new site It pretty much removes everything about the mobile reddit that I liked the stripped down clean interface mostly text I used to be able to see several headlines on a the screen at the same time now I can barely see one I do not plan to use the new interface please continue to allow us the option to use the old interface It would be nice to be able to get to individual subreddits with less navigation How about putting them directly in the dropdown on the top right rather having to select Reddits to get a list of them Wow Looks good Sorry redditisfun Reddit has a mobile site Aw shit I was just mastering the art of browsing reddit with a  touchscreen and not reporting posts and clicking the wrong subreddit every time Looks awesome though Using it on my N and I love it Though I cant see the upvote and downvote button Fantastic work looks absolutely perfect Thank you Just two requests  Please obey the comment threshold dont show me comments with a score less than in the user preferences It would make the comments page slimmer and more useful  Add a Save function to the Options menu Sometimes links randomly open in new tabs but its hard to track when and why Works really well on my iPhone thanks guys Anyone else get a  every time they try to log in I dont see the arrows Only gray boxes I am using opera mini  on a blackberry storm This actually runs noticeably slower than the nonmobile interface on my HTC Hero Test post from mynexus one things look great but how do I move between pages I see no next and previous on home page Text doesnt automatically resize on my htc legend Thats my only concern I love your AJAX spinner That is all I really like it thanks Reddit team Maybe Im blind but is there a save for later button IPhone g here Besides that its awesome Looks great on my incredible using it right now Although the load more comments buttons seem to be a lot bigger than all the other buttons Really nice I think theres a bit of tweaking but at least you can change it now on the fly without having to go through the app store Mad props you made the right move Looks pretty bad on Nokia  dunno what browser is there Youd think in  you guys would figure out how to make crossbrowser compatible websites OK its VERY buggy on my Nokia E Symbian s default brower and Opera Mini  On the default browser its not good because you cant click any links theres a lot of bugs buttons are invisible and theres a trace when you scroll down of what you just scrolled past And its virtually unusable on the Opera Browser because most of the buttons are only in a whiteish outline It might be nice and work for touch screen iphones but for those of us with Blackberrys or Nokia smartphones this is a step back im afraid but i can post a comment most mobile browsers are built around webkit and we optimized the css for those browsers We apologize in advance to anyone using mobile IE Exactly why IE has to support webkit tags Otherwise nothing will work in their browser unless people care enough to add IE specific tags My pc is too big how am I meant to make it mobile stop wasting my time reddit ARRRGHHH The restroom breaks are going to be much more fun from now on I feel naked without my comment karma awesome Collapse and options button dont work for me on iPhone gs Seems okay but new style doesnt render correctly on my Blackberry Storm Looks funky on Opera Mini Love the new mobile page The splash page is classy too It looks good but doesnt work properly fonts are messed up on both the blackberry default browser and on Opera mobile this new version needs serious fixing It looks better than the desktop version Seems to load a bit slow Some things could perhaps use a bit of Ajax love Other than that I thinks its fantastic At over MB for data usage I wont be browsing reddit or any site on my phone any time soon Random Brownian motion Id like to see the calculations of the Peclet number that lead to this conclusion Bravo Probably an Android browser bug but you should make scroll stick so when I dive into an item and come back Ill be at the same item on the homepage Right now I have to scroll a bunch to get back down to where I was Open in new window is too many clicks for this use case The parent button doesnt work on the iPhone  I like it Way better than before It looks like garbage on opera mobile Question Is it possible to prevent the page from reloading if you close the voting overlayhttpimgurcomOsuj On blackberry storm i couldnt see what the main pages three options were Just empty boxes Until I put my finger on top of them But then my finger was in the way so I still couldnt see the options So I gave up and went back to downloading porn Pretty good indeed I have to say access to subreddits is pretty PITA right now but I might be missing something Apart from that pretty good indeed Interesting to see a mobile site which renders better on the phone than on my desktop but I guess you are pretty heavy on the webkitspecific CSS and I still swear to Firefox Also Thanks for the update on status of the iPhoneapplication I was wondering what was up with that could you make a version with view oldernewer buttons on the bottom the scrolling down to see more is impossibly slow to use and ruins using the back buttons Awesome on Droid Incredible Now when is custom subreddit CSS for mobile going to happen  Fantastic The thing lacking with the mobile apps was the ability to open multiple tabs and then visit them later no offense to the android reddit app maker Wheeee Yeah thanks for fucking up my productivity away from my computer but hes brown The options button is a bit out of place and the voting arrows arent coming across very well on my Blackberry  httpimgurcomRFqO When viewing it on my Nexus One Like the interface hate the iphone styling viewing articlescomments is fine but when I go back a page it always takes me to the top of the page not where the article is located  You mean reddit has had a mobile site this whole time Thank you Looks awesome on my Archos  IT D Looks great but scrolling even after the main page loaded is painfully slow the nonmobile one is blazing fast if we compare it I was connected to wifi The regular website loads faster renders faster scrolls faster NOT GOOD Also I touched on the options button and it took a good  seconds for anything to show On HTC Magic android  cyanogen Could we get a Go button on the search pages Adding comments also painful from my Droid on Dolphin browser Page is slow to respoond and cannot see cursor in edit box Not sure how it is on the default browser Edit slow down seems to occur on pages with large comment count I cant get the little downarrow menus to work in the default droid browser on any page Can see the cursor editing this post so the hiding cursor could also be related to large comment count anyone else having issues with blackberry smartphones Awesome The new look seems great so far on Android Nice work I fucking love it Good job and thanks Sent from my iPhone Frigging awesome Much preferred to the iPhone apps so far Great job This doesnt work great on the Pre webos Some of the buttons are broken simply dont respond and the website wont even display until I make a swipe to move it around at which point it will pop up Looks pretty once it shows up however As and Android user thank you so much The old mobile site was useless and the unofficial reddit app reddit is fun isnt necessarily a bad app and it does get the job done but it is pretty clunky to use I really prefer well built mobile web sites to apps that do nothing but show regular web data No good on my android phone Please let my mobile browser do the resizing of the article Yay thanks Soooooooo much better than ireddit On nexus one froyo this is the cats pajamas Well done Im on it I hope it works this version isnt phone friendly believe me Ive tried it while waiting at doctors offices DMV red lights getting my fast food I panic if I dont get my Reddit fix for at least two hours a day Awesome The background colors are a bit strong though it all looks the same Its better to put color where you want the user to looknotice things than color all over the place Question do most basic mobile phones not have a sidescrolling functionality Whenever I go to mredditcom on my relatively basic phones its as if the page is designed without scrolling in mine I just press the left and right navigational buttons as I do with the upanddown ones Because of the lack of scrolling on the site the text box gets smaller and smaller to fit a fixedwidth screen Wouldnt it be better to keep the text box of each comment no matter how far down a thread an equalsized box just indented to the right Instead of seeing  Reddit comment blah blah blah  Reddit comment blah blah bl  ah  Reddit comment blah bla  h blah  Reddit comment blah  blah blah And so on all the way down to youll know what I mean if you have used mredditcom before  R  e  d  d  i  t   c  o  m  m  e  n  t   b  l  a And so on You know the sad part Im such a Reddit comment addict that Ive tried to read comments one line thick before Instead of this it would be  Reddit comment blah blah blah  Reddit comment blah blah blah  Reddit comment blah blah blah In other words sanctity of comment width not sanctity of page width How come if I navigate to redditcom on my Droid Eris I am not automatically redirected to iredditcom by default with an option to view normal reddit if I prefer Shouldnt my client be automatically detected and routed to the most appropriate version of the site Nice No need for a Reddit app now On Droid here takes alot of ram and is pretty slow Also things are a little small on the screen for thumb operation If I clucked always use the new site how can I change my mind Infinite scrolling doesnt do it for me and Id much rather have my pages back Awesome And just the other day I was thinking how much of a pain it was to have to zoom in to upvote This also looks and works very well on the iPad Thank you ps I have one minor suggestion individual buttons for hiding comments and whatnot Only a slight a annoyance but it would be nice instead of having to tap on the pulldown button first But again thanks Testing testing    Yeah baby Look at me Im redditing from my phone Woooo Hmmm This is actually quite buggy I wonder how it compares ro the reddit is fun app Ive been really happy with that app its all ive ever used Is there a hide option Its the most useful button on this site I think your iPhone app needs bigger buttons on the right hand side to view the comments rather than the link Fix that and I wont care what your mobile site is like Maybe it just that Im not smart enough Im using it on an iPhone and I cant figure out how to work it I cant figure out how to log in or post commnts I had to go back to the iReddit app to post this When I click on options or the down arrow icon is something supposed to happen It doesnt for me I just made a Chrome extension that makes the mobile reddit toolbar be the default toolbar as I prefer the mobile one Edit Fixed link  httpschromegooglecomextensionsdetailhnadelehgiejkljbmlpljojelebcjjfn Way better than the app Great job reddit Looks good but the comment page needs some work at least on the Droid Incredible For some reason the format doesnt match up like the homepage does and the scrolling is very slow Its a nice design but I think Ill be sticking to the Reddit is Fun app Just in time My IT guy just blocked Reddit Absolutely fantastic thank you I had no idea reddit had a mobile site Ive always browsed the regular site on my HTC from DoCoMo Im going to keep browsing the normal site too The mobile site did not run very well on my android The regular site seems to run much better Thats great but the little toolbar you get when visiting linked sites is really small I dont know if its possible but making it independent of the content of the page when zooming on mobile devices would be lovely Not sure if its just nexus one android w dolphin browser but when you follow a link and there is that floating like it  dislike it thing I have to vote or close it before viewing the content as it prevents me from scrolling  Also the updown arrows on the main page are a little small Other than that AWESOME OH MY GOD THERES A MOBILE REDDIT Just when I thought I could protect my time by leaving my computer this comes along A couple of comments from an iPhone  page is a bit laggy after buttton presses ie it takes a noticeable second to do what its supposed to do  everytime I try to scroll or click anywhere on a comment the whole page has to change color and drop down the comment toolbar I feel like itd be less annoying if the toolbar only came down when clicking on the arrow  the buttons are still a little small especially the more options button on comments  scrolling within the comment submission box is fairly broken Still much nicer to use than iReddit though  It looks great Though Id like a way to browse subreddits that Im not already subscribed to I dont mean to diminish your accomplishments as this is a huge step up Thanks you redditz I always had to switch between the mobile version and the app on my phone because I just couldnt choose due to me not liking how it was This will help when I am staying up past  AM when I should be sleeping D Looks great It would be great if there are options for mobile For example compress comments or load all at once etc Im almost tempted to use it instead of the regular site Almost I dont really like the comment sections Show just the original post then have it clickable to dropdown subposts Edit Im on a mobile device with special formatting btw Its much faster but the regular reddit is still easier to use to me Thank you so very much reddit team D   Way too easy to hit the submitter name or subreddit name when you mean to hit the story title  What is the options button that appears on every story for It doesnt do anything when touched  What about the Aa button That doesnt appear to do anything either HTC Incredible here
