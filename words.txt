overall only when a post reaches the top  of rall In Canada we recently had our govt double down on our net neutrality position I think the issue with the US is special interest groups are representing all groups but the US people maybe the people should pay for one seems to be working for the bigger companies As sad as it sounds we probably have more power as an individual over making EA change something in a game than stopping the massive conglomerates who buy our politicians from dismantling Net Neutrality That being said I am still going to try To be fair its much easier to cancel a preorder for a game than it is to cancel your internet deleted Comcast is the only game in town for a lot of us Theyre building huge skyscrapers and getting politicians in their pocket Its only a matter of when not if They keep resurrecting this bill and will continue to do so Fuck you Comcast and fuck you Brian Roberts Try getting some of your shitheel billionaire buddies to actually do something noble with all the money you have You disgusting greedy cunts Im embarrassed to admit it but Im just fucking tired man Im tired of fighting this Im tired of creating awareness Im tired of talking to government employees who answer the phones and dont give a shit Im tired of the FFTF emails Im even tired of seeing this pop up on Reddit because this should have been over with months or years ago And it sounds like Im not the only one And I think this is exactly why they keep doing this  to tire us out But youre right we have to keep doing it We have to keep fighting and letting the appropriate people know they will not stay in office if they keep voting to remove NN Im mad enough for both removed deleted The best way to fight net neutrality in my opinion is locally coopted fiber networks There are a ton of small companies who have the ability to do all the work they just need clearance and capital to do it Net Neutrality is meaningless if EVERY internet customer has at least  high speed wired services available to their home from at least  different companies We did get mad about NN Then again Then again Its starting to get a little tiresome I think the problem is people dont realize how negatively something is going to affect them until it happens By then its too late Get Comcast or the FCC to do an AMA then well see the downvoting You people What do you mean you people If I understand correctly your US people in charge can make bad censored internet for whole world So how can nonUS people even help ah i see this kind of narrative is going to pin the failure to uphold net neutrality on us the customers for not doing enough even though our voices are horse from shouting how much we dont want this jammed congressional phonelines with our ardent refusals and a mountain of letters demanding the same what fucking world have you been on where you think we havent been doing everything we can short of criminal activity to make it clear that we dont want this shit its a rigger game and we all know it they will use sentiments like yours to prove that they were right to do what they are doing now im thinking you are comcast PR I dont understand this outrage at people for being passionate about something news flash YOU CAN HATE MORE THAN  THING AT A TIME Just because people are bitching about SWBF doesnt mean theyre not the same people that go out and try and get shit changed yea definitely a way way bigger issue as a nonUS resident Swiss how does this affect me ISPs like Swisscom offer Gbps updown packages with no limits here my Bitcoin full node sends over GB a day and you actually get the advertised speeds  is this net neutrality thing irrelevant for me or no Us people are an international community There is little we can do about an American legal issue I hate these posts I think most of us have been mad about net neutrality for at least two or three years running We are allowed to also have other things were mad about Apparently you werent around for SOPA PIPA CISPA et al Our outrage peaked years ago Now were tired Why do you have a problem with that Since the promised tax cuts are going to leave you with so much extra cash in your wallet sarcasm Not like you can just cancel your FCC preorder Im ashamed at what this country is turning into were gonna be just like Russia in a decade complete fucking corporate oligarchy The FCC killing NN is the nail in the coffin for me Fuck our government they arent for the people they only serve our corporate overlords I did not comment about SWBFIITWO But for my NN i need my internet Fuck these greedy BASTARDS TO DEATH How may i improve my combat against these savages Edit THESE FATTYS ALREADY GET ME FOR  A MONTH So did you miss when all of Reddit was up in arms against the Congress and the FCC for repealing these rules Did you miss when there were hundreds of thousands of comments on the FCC website Did you miss when multiple bills in the past were blocked before the latest iteration When there were endless calls to contact your representatives The was no FCC comment to downvote on Reddit and break a record You cant just cancel your internet to send a message to the FCC In other words all of the visible actions that we COULD do on reddit to push back against EA are impossible to do If theres one thing I hate its lying and your post is lying about Reddit being inactive over net neutrality The big difference is the people trying to kill Net Neutrality arent conveniently posting on Reddit so they can get mass downvoted Insulting people definitely brings them onto your side Hmm Didnt realize people could only be concerned about one thing at a time Or that everyone here was American If you cared about healthcare and taxes as much as you do FPS Microtransactions for everything Because tons of people who frequent Reddit arent US citizens and cant really do anything about it The worst part is that it WILL affect us but all we can do is cry to our US friends until they either do something or its too late What blows my mind is that even though its very clear that the populace doesnt want change in that direction they keep fighting the people until it works Weve had the exact opposite happen in Canada  they AUGMENTED net neutrality What do you want us to fucking do Stop buying internet access EA is easy to boycott I know that by not buying something I can have an impact and it is something I WANT to do Writing my senator or some shit is not worth my time and something I have no interest in doing Its too late for this to be seen but what scares me the most isnt the power to regulate even more so what media we can see etc Its how theyll be able to legally stop Mass communication across the country and globe or at least any agenda they dont want such as this very conversation Not only that but theyll have control over science as well Choose which literature to load faster or slower or which sites to promote such as pubmed vs web of science if any at all All of a sudden these companies have near total control over what they decide reality is instead of objectivity loading their own conflict of interest research instead of the ones refuting it We know from the old sugar campaigns that they dont care about citizens health so long as they turn a dollar Unless we stop using the internet which we wont we not only lose the most powerful tool to ever come into being but we also loose the capacity to stop them from utterly controlling every American life without question I get what you mean but Battlefront is a game thats sold worldwide NN being killed currently only affects Americans There is a slight lack of logic here Battlefront II was receiving GLOBAL backlash Net Neutrality is a US only issue so people in other countries cantwont do shit because it doesnt affect them NN has been solidified elsewhere so their jobs are done  of this sub dont care fuck all about US politics Some pay  in taxes in Europe Should I post this to pcmasterrace too Or do you not care about our finances either  If you people would get even half as mad over X as you did with Y we might get Z Just cause some gamers rallied against EA doesnt mean they dont rally for Net Neutrality The only reason that the outrage at EA blew up so much was because they made that pretentious comment here which got downvoted so much Without that people still would have been pissed but wouldnt have done anything about it How do we support net neutrality from an outside country Im Australian and it seems like our opinions should matterl but they just dont If we lose will the internet ever be the same again If EA would come out and publically support revoking Net Neutrality they could singlehandedly sink the FCCs efforts Who cares what the US does You reap what you sow What power do we even have All previous outcried was just ignored entirely Corporate greed will always prevail and they could care less what the people say about it All the comments we submit will mysteriously disappear again like last time The issue is that Ashit ajit Pai has made it pretty clear he will not listen to the people Its tantamount to treason in my eyes Hear me out here Maybe just maybe theres a peenyweeny chance not all of us are American The difference is that EA is beholden to investors while scumsucking shitlords like Ajit Pai and his Republican overlords are accountable to no one that gives a fuck You think the people that voted in Trump even understand net neutrality This has been posted dozens of times hence the downvtes Not all of us are from USA you know that right Assuming everyones american Typical reddit tbh America isnt the only country in the world Unlucky As an Irish person watching all of this happen over the past few days I completely agree Cant believe how lax you guys are about the whole Net Neutrality thing You people I dont care about your internet USA Stop electing corrupted leeches if youre not happy with them Internet neutrality is your fight not ours Oh god stfu You forget one major thing OP Battlefront II affects people worldwide while some shit comcast does to fuck over Americans only affects well Americans Not saying NN isnt important the very contrary couldnt be more true But for the love of all that is holy please understand httpsihredbubblenetimageflatxfujpg that not everyone is American here Heres the difference People around the world are pissed at EA Only pissed Americans can do anything about American net neutrality Oh shut up Net neutrality is always talked about when it comes up People can get mad at other things too Posting crap like this just paints the issue in a negative way when assholes make condescending posts like this We have heard about this every day since BF issues started Upvoting for visibility but I disagree with the notion that we havent been outraged by the push to kill Net Neutrality The problem is that it isnt a new highly visible problem The Battlefront  issue is fairly fresh to the media Net Neutrality is an old horse That being said we definitely need to be aware of outrage fatigue Thats when theyll quietly pass the vote This EA is a private company it pisses me off what they are doing but they are able to do what ever the fuck they want The Govnerment forcing their hands with Net Neutrality is a whole issue about freedoms and keeping the internet preorderers have no right to complain you guys can fuck off At this point its Comcast being a dick for throttling data versus Google being a dick for censoring data Until Google actually lives up to Dont Be Evil Im out Let them fight If the FCC cared half as much about downvotes as EA we might get to keep our nice internet We can at least hit EA in the wallet by refunding preorders There isnt jack shit that anyone can do to persuade Aijit Pai to choose whatever hes been paid to do by the big telcos As a person from Poland and European Union citizen this thing doesnt affect me by any chance and Im  sure that EU government will never let that happend inside the Union From my perspective it is a concern of USA citizens It doesnt mean i dont fell sorry for you Everyone should have access to internet without limits Charter is already intentionally throttling my streaming To any fellow Americans as if it hasnt been mentioned hundreds of times before  Please call your state office httpscallsorg is a great website that makes it easy to get the right number to the right person Currently the best script if you dont even know what to say when calling Hi my name is NAME and Im a concerned customer from Moab Im calling to express my disapproval that the FCC is trying to kill net neutrality and the strong Title II oversight of Internet Service Providers Preserving an open internet is crucial for fair and equal access to the resources and information available on it Optional Explain why net neutrality is personally important to you or your work Thank you for your time and attention IF LEAVING A VOICEMAIL please leave your full street address to ensure your call is tallied Lets keep the internet boys People are pissed about it We all know about it Theres literally not a damn thing we can do about it till the next election If you think calling anybody in power right now is going to change their mind youre a fool We know whats going down dont act like youre special Quit wasting everybodys time not an american dont give a shit sorry Or how about the bees or loss of topsoil or super resistant bacteria or  Upvote train Send this to the top Remember when we didnt have Net Neutrality and all those terrible things everyone said would happen were already happening Games are global USAs intenet is not theyre not the same targets USA people overestimating how many will take action Im not so sure because the Battlefront II issue was taking on one piddly software company whereas the fight to keep net neutrality is a fight against gargantuan megacorporations with their tentacles hentaideep inside the US government The difference is the Ajit Pai doesnt give a shit about whats best for the people Hes killing it regardless At least with EA people can get refunds or just boycott them What are you going to do against Comcast Cox Time WarnerSpectrum Nothing Because in  of locations theyre the only the game in town But if your city is lucky enough to have a cable ISP and ATT for DSL or DirecTV for satellite youre still kinda fucked ATT DSL isnt that great at least in my town and who the fuck is gonna game on satellite internet I find myself incredibly lucky that I was able to get away from Spectrum and get with Google Fiber Not everyone is lucky And ISPs dont like competition ATT tried to sue and block Google Fiber in some locations One ISP sued a town because the town wanted to build their own ISP After that ISP refused to lay more fiber to connect more rural areas They got pissed that the town said okay if you not gonna do it well do it ourselves The ISP sued and said it was unfair competition Bottom line Pai is an ISP stooge Hes gonna look out for them The people dont matter Listen here OP you little shit Net neutrality is the only thing Ive actually taken the time to call my senator about I could give a fuck about whatever game everyone is upset about but when it comes to taking away my right as an american to jerk off to mature piss porn in the privacy of my own home well thats just down right unamerican Sadly there are a lot less people willing to cancel their internet subscription to send a message I doubt this is a popular opinion but I dont think supporting net nuetrality is necessarily the best route Its something I think people need to look into to more instead of just jumping on something because of scary sounding propaganda Consider In the past twenty years access to the internet has only become more widespread and service today is far faster for many people  including ordinary people  than it was twenty years ago or even ten years ago Today broadband in Europe where the internet is more tightly regulated has less reach than it has in the United States Source httpsmisesorglibrarynetneutralityscamhttpsmisesorglibrarynetneutralityscam And this In truth net neutrality has never fostered fairness or better access for consumers and has instead created conditions that will encourage less competition and more monopolistic power for large firms within the industry Instead of relying on the market place to allocate goods net neutrality ensures that politics will determine who gets what instead This is hardly a recipe for fairness or neutrality Source httpsmisesorgblognetneutralitystrengthensmonopoliesinvitescorruptionhttpsmisesorgblognetneutralitystrengthensmonopoliesinvitescorruption I actually got my internet moved up from mbs to mbs for free Just wait until NN is killed and Comcast lowers your data caps and throttles connections unless you buy their  Power Gamer tier on top of their standard  connection fee Its going to make this whole Battlefront fiasco seem petty The odds of this happening are ridiculously low and guess what theres literally NOTHING that Net Neutrality does that could prevent them from doing this literally right the fuck now Hey buddy there is a difference between a Game Company who thrives on a specific group of people to make money off of and a Corporation that provides service to everyone whos demographic is literally everyone EA cant afford to lose the business of gamers and bad press of Star Wars would bring Disney into the fray and cause EA to lose another source of revenue if Disney revokes their Star Wars License The big fucks like Ajit Pai can afford to ignore Net Neutrality comments because once its killed off he and everyone else can line their pockets even more He can continue to ignore comments because other corporations pay them to We can raise hell in person on the net through physical means like letters to our senators and whatnot but the FCC will repeat the same shit theyve said before These protestors were paid those comments were from bots these letters to senators dont mean anything to someone who gets paid to ignore them and follow the AntiNet Neutrality Agenda Money wins in the end and its money that will lead to a really harsh fall one day Hint Net Neutrality is only a problem in US because the most other civilized countries do have no sell out of their administrative structures  and Battlefront II is a worldwide problem So it is pretty hard to compare those Why should I get enraged about American Net Neutrality Got a letter back from my representative saying he will vote no to net neutrality Progress comes in steps Are there people who arent mad about it Youre just whoring it out for gold and karma You didnt post the link until you got it These posts are absolute bullshit PCMR definitely cares deeply about Net Neutrality but we have a captured FCC that cares nothing about our views no matter how loud we get the problem is the large population of reddit users clearly have an attention span of  day most people are probably going to be buying swb anyways the next month or  edit Oh downvotes Comcast PR is on it Fuck you and fuck off Is that how your internet was prior to NN False equivalency Theres a country I heard about recently where they have no net neutrality laws and you have to pay  for different packages of social media sites communication sites gaming sites and so on also kids can play video games and be on reddit They cant vote Man this post is filled with a lot of corporate shills throwing around wild accusations to distract is from the main point that Net Neutrality is a international issue Although it may just be affecting the US soon does not mean it will stop there I for one do not want the internet to be censored Title II literally has a provision for government censorship I am so confused why people on reddit think that title II  uncensored internet Battlefront is interesting for europeans US American Net Neutrality is not so there is not that much traffic about this topic you people Yeah you fucking lost me dude Im in the UK and I could have cared to do something but you people arent protected by EU like we are for the time being anyway Good luck Sort out your own fcking government Stop voting for people who are in the pockets of big industries and then you might end up with politicians who act in the interest of THE PEOPLE Because it doesnt matter how mad we get or what we do theyre just going to ignore it and vote to kill it to make their big donors from telecom companies happy None of these net neutrality rules are even in place Every horror story that big government advocates claim will happen could literally be happening right now And internet access has gotten better over the years You guys are just circle jerking for another huge federal government power grab Oh Jesus Stop fucking whining I think that the idea that people dont care as much is because we arent able to directly impact them like those over at the SWBF subreddit did with their campaign against EA People probably feel helpless because of all the channels that we have to go through just to get a hold of someone and its not even guaranteed that our outcries will even have an impact I think that might answer the question as to why some people might view that there is a lack of attention on net neutrality I know that I dont know where to start sometimes even when the Net neutrality bot links all its shit to help out NN Its intimidating and politics are fucking awful because its all about shady people doing shady things and confusing the layman with their lawyer speak which is meant to confuse those who arent accustomed to reading their bullshit It honestly sucks ass and should not be this way but it is Just remember to make sure you are voting for a candidate who has your best interest in mind I see it happening in the US and as an Australian I am honestly just waiting for it to hit us We are practically trained to receive everything America does at a later date Movies technology policies I just hope the fight is as strong for Australia as it is for the US or we are fucked Not to mention my business is fucked i am not from america and i have a question but im not sure in which subreddit i should ask this i have seen many altrightveryconservative people who somehow think that net neutrality is a leftyproblem who said what to manage to make these people think that are republicans in america not using the internet as much or did they fell to some sort of propaganda I mean this goes for everything in politics currently Lots of things were vastly more important than the EA shenanigans Did you know the FCC just allowed a merger so a single company is capable of controling most american local news stations Scary stuff Wholeheartedly agree At the end of the day EA is still trying to earn our business The Government and TelCo companies have significantly less desire to earn our business since the latter have the money and capability to just shut down our options Like thishttpsimgurcomaaQilYh That moment when you become the tech guy in your class because you got the PC working againeven though the solution was just to put the power cable in  of computer problems are solved by power switch and googling it Still cant get my new build to recognize the printer You can see from the sweat in her hair that its even more complicated than she thought What if I never played with Legos as a kid I dont have the same experience that you all do Uh SrGrafo Can you help me out with thishttpsimgurcomaATCGB and money goes in endless hole building a pc is so expensivehttpsimgurcomvpopLBN Real talk is it actually that easy Never looked

Brother Woooo I love uvaarikass and usrgrafo hanging out and putting computers together can I come hang out too My birds and the bees talk somehow went a similar way My friends couldnt get a karaoke machine to work I looked at the cables Red cable was in green hole green was in yellow etc Is this normalhttpsimgurcomoxYVRJt The  pin cable header for your fan goes nowhere because its tiny and my fat sausage fingers cant plug it into the motherboard so I guess I have no fans and Ill only use it in a walkin cooler What about the USB cable I never get it right the first time I will never understand how people can be intimidated of hooking up electronics Reminds me of the scene in Idiocracy where the guy is mashing the square block through the round hole Found it httpiimgurcomDlkEtqygif Push on the RAM stick until it makes an unsettlingly loud click Its either broken forever or installed correctly with no issues oh god i am early Just here for the edits D And then you forget to switch on the psu and think you broke a  part Literally just high stakes lego A D U L T L E G O S Sing with me The green cables connected to the  green hole the squary cables connected to the  squary hole I dont get the joke Isnt that just setting it up Building it seems a lot more complicated than that THESE COMICS ARENT FUNNY WHY ARE THEY ALL POPULAR Comic is too unrealistic I fix computers all day and have never had a women talk to me Meanwhile Im here teaching my mom to do this with a TV SMH Jeez and here Ive been rolling dice over and over again My microphone cable is blue  Im not gonna lie I was very nervous when I assembled my first PC Looking back at it its not difficult at all Remind me the day when a girl ask me how to add a picture in a power point Grafo are you spying on me I just built a PC and Ive been telling this to everyone who asks me about how hard it is I usually find more old white men having difficulties with this Just wait until they learn about what fits in different motherboard slots and cpu sockets Itll be like advanced calculus for them Ill never admit to my friends and family how simple it is I enjoy them thinking Im some kind of genius for knowing how to build custom PCs Is there a deeper issue there Maybe but Im not a doctor  of people will fuck up the IO panel connection though What hole does my dick go in i remember my brother fixing my aunts computer and she said to me something like look how hes disassembled the pc and i then say  ahh thats normal i will not forget the confused look look at her face I dont know how I managed to read scary cable and scary hole but it made just as much sense to me  In th grade my teachers could never get the projector to work Rectangular cable goes Into rectangular hole trapezoid cable goes into trapezoid hole I told them Did they listen No Am I still salty Idk you tell me People in my class literally think im an expert on computers just because i play a shit ton of video games Ah yes i remember when minecraft redstone taught me how to fix a broken hard disk good times I work in ITbut Im red and green colour blind Why is there no triangle hole and hexagonal hole Must the entire world use colours to code things D You fool Youve plugged the hdmi cord into the motherboard These comics are getting worse Telling her which holes they go in  This guy is  rigging the votes to get on the front page Literally nobody thought this was funny but what if there is a green and square cable SrGrafo Where does that go Not the same for USBs  Finally that shapes game I played as a child is helping me Dont forget about the parts that click into other ones The hardest part for me at least was remembering to turn on the power supply But where does the mouse go into Bro what if a pc had a fucking fish tank in it bro Squary to Wait slow down there youre going too fast This resonates with me I wrapped mine clean across the house Behind couches and TVs neatly tucked out of sight between the carpet and moldings Only to come up a few feet short of my pc fml Just tell your most gullible family member that youre worried about and want to reduce the amount of radiation in your home Something something electro smog Mine went out the window of the room with the router along the outside of the house in my bedroom window and to my computer You see my computer wasnt allowed to have internet access in those days because it was a luxury and using the internet for games was stupid and a waste of money If you change house to apartment and family to roommates then this perfectly describes my college living experience Silly question that Im wondering if someone can answer How long does a Ethernet cable need to be for it to finally just not even be worth it not taking into account structural limitations with WiFi When I still lived at home I actually did this I wasnt allowed to run it up the stairs from the living roomlounge where the box was located So I ran the cable out the window to my sisters room window upstairs behind her bed and wardrobe under the crack at the bottom of her door around the outside of the landing our rooms faced each other and tucked in at the edge of the carpet and then under my own door where there was about  feet of cable left and I simply wrapped the loose cable up and plugged it in with the cable hidden behind my desk All of this because my WiFi disconnected while I was fighting the lich king we was stuck on him for about  weeks at this point with the guild and my disconnect stopped us from killing the fucker that night I use gigabit power line adapters I hate having to run cables more than a few feet but insist on my pc having a cable connection Surprising how few people think of this as an option considering how much cables of that length cost A bit unrelated but thanks to the internet I am beginning to convert those weird units automatically in my head I quickly thought of m Ran a ft cable between houses once to play LAN with my brother Just tape it across the floor nobody will notice Mine ran from one end of the house to the other about  ft My parents and I both eventually got sick of packing it up and resetting it up whenever they had company over and my dad didnt wanna give up the second router I set up as an access point for the other end of the house so he actually drilled a couple holes in the floor to help me run it across the basement ceiling Ive moved out since and now my roommates and I use a combination of command hooks and zip ties to run Ethernet throughout our apartment my dads cool and an electrician so he just ran it through the wall and made an ethernet wall port in my room then i got a gigabit switch My sons old room is now known as the computer room The modem routers server desktop and gaming desktop are in there Short cables but a lot of cables I have POE cameras connected Went in the attic to run the cabling to my switch in the closet I also have Raspberry PIs running specific tasks I run the rest of my toys through TPLink powerline Works Back when I lived at my parents house my room was the furthest possible distance from the router So I ran a ft cable out of the router through the basement ceiling and up through an air duct into my room Still there to this day Wallfishing isnt hard and ethernet keystones are cheap This is eerily accurate I did this I did this recently with flat cat  cable Run it along the base of the walls or where the wall meets the ceiling Praise Toothless I can relate  Ive had a ft one under mats and carpets etc just to have better signal Not to be a nitpicker but has anyone else made a moca network in their house Less loss longer distances faster speeds How long can you run a cable before you start getting more ping Or in other words whats the pingft ratio for ethernet cords As an owner of PC with Ethernet connection  packets were dropped while downloading this meme Please excuse my ignorance Why is the cable better than wifi Is it faster speeds or more reliabilitystability or both Same i literally did this lol This is literally me I ran it all the way up the stairs to my room and its been glorious family barely notices it anymore Duct taping the cord to the ceiling so nobody trips over the cord Not because I care about their safety but because I dont want anybody messing up my connection with their fucking shoe stuffers My dad bless his soul somehow got his ethernet cable from the router to the pc I should mention that the router is downstairs and the pc is upstairs and he put the cable through the vents  footers but very accurate Sound guy here electrician by trade Ive put miles and miles and miles of cable in friends houses for this exact purpose I enjoy the work and they get to have snappy interwebs Work always gives me leftover cable and parts so it doesnt really cost anyone anything If you can learn how to make your own Ethernetcoax cables I suggest you do Its super cheap compared to buying them And you can help friends so everyone wins My dad actually knows how to use tools so he installed a Ethernet port into my room poggers I was going to do this before I discovered that you can run Ethernet through the power socket You just need an adapter to plug your router into and one to plug the Ethernet into your device Ethernet over power dude I expanded what I was doing and my dad helped my route mine through the attic and make it look nice This is the most relatable thing Ive read on reddit in a while it sucks having your router in your garage and having your room on the exact opposite side of the house This very to my life right now Wait a minute Did I post this This is literally me people that game on wifi can rot in hell they think its fine but its not its  not fine Some of us are spoiled and have a router on our desks i showed this to my mom and she laughed bc thats exactly what i do I did this with what i thought was a cat  cable I cut drywall Fished it through drop ceiling tiles Stapled it to the wall to keep it low profile the works Hooked it to my wifes brand new computer and got a wopping mbs Turns out I got hoodwinked by a Chinese seller I have a ft cable while my pc is ft away I have it if just someday I want to shift it around When i moved into my apartment i literally duct taped a meter long cable across the ceiling because the router and the PC are on opposite corners of the room  years later i still look at that cable from time to time and think one day im gonna buy cable shaft and properly hide those cables Then i turn on the PC and forget all about it Working in IT and frequently running cables for office environments I am eager for the next time I move to run ethernet through ceiling and walls to my PC and to any entertainment consols Roku Switch etc I wish I could up vote this  times Did this to my gigabit switch just to be able to have everything wired Now if only they built an Ethernet port for your phone Our router is in the living room our computers are in the little dining area next to kitchen Thank god the floor is hardwood so we could tape the cable to the ground The title confused me for a second because both cables and wifi are cognate words in spanish I drilled a hole in my parents floor to get the cable to the basementthey were not to happy with me If anyone is going to build a house here make sure you install some Ethernet cables between the walls to each room Its much better than having cables run through your house This is actually how my setup is right now I got my internet provider to run me a ft ethernet cable that runs up along the exterior of my home Then to top it off they had to drill a hole through my wall and run the cable through it And thats how Im hard lined to my router Literally what I did but my mom understood which is nice I bought ft cat from the router to a newly bored hole in the floor to the ceiling of the basement to under my room to another hole right beneath my computer MBps download is wonderful compared to wifi across the whole house using extenders Thank you for your service Together we can make a difference one cat at a time I paid a Verizon tech  just so I had a working ethernet port in my home office Totally worth it Cables are ugly My step dad helped me do this We got a ft cable and drilled a hole that went to the basement my router is in the sunroom of my house and my room is in the basement and routed it through vents and stuff right to my room I think my step dad had more fun doing it then I did lmao this is the only one of these that actually made me laugh its beyond accurate because Ive actually told people to do this and they look at me JUST FUCKING LIKE THAT My nephew did this He ran the cable from the router through the floor to the basement then all the way to his room Run it out the windows Parents love that This speaks to me in an emotional level I spent a day installing my cable in the corner of the ceiling across my entire house because I wasnt allowed to punch a tiny hole though the wall to feed it directly into my room Only as an adult did I realize I was actually asking for permission to blindly punch a hole through  feet of wall Mine is inside the walls Wow I never thought this post would blow up lol This is my first time getting gold and platinum I recently ran a ft cat  ethernet cable through my house I did this by running the cables around walls and around doorways I used tape because my family didnt want holes drilled through the wall That is how I thought of this meme The meme just popped in my head and I thought eh I will get like only  upvotes its not worth it But I had nothing better to do lol so I went ahead and created the meme I honestly have meme ideas like this all the time but I just think there are so many other people that my posts will get lost in the sea of posts Thanks a million for going out of your way spend money and show your appreciation i did the same thing but my parents wouldnt let me run it through the house no matter how tidy i made it so i drilled a hole in the roof and fed it all the way into my room I never really thought that there was much of a difference until I started using cables On top of much better speed the connection is also always consistent It doesnt just waiver and slow down on a whim Man this hits home lol I have a ft spanned between every nook to my PC Isnt there a thing you can plug into your wall and it runs through the houses wires Or is that slower than just an Ethernet cable I know this is a joke but these things work miracles and the lines are already run httpswwwtechradarcomnewsnetworkingpowerlinenetworkingwhatyouneedtoknow Man in wish I could afford a gaming PC instead of a garbage LGE Nexus  phone with a cobweb of cracks in the corner of the screen and  MHz that runs Minecraft Bedrock at  FPS with minimum graphics settings Why just not use a PoweLine Adaper Seriously at that point just use powerline internet adapters This is me Router is in the upstairs living area room is maybe like  ft from the router Only have a ft cable I make it look nice going into my room but I cant be asked to roll up the excess and make it look pretty Shoved the rest of it in a corner next to my bed I dont look at said corner The end This is perfect well done Im currently at my parents place taking care of the house while theyre on holiday It was a bit warm in my old room in the attic so Im redecorating the living room LOL at my old house my mom helped me put the Ethernet through the vents from the middle floor to my basement room Good times Is there any signal attenuation or something like that across that distance Same I ran a ft one to get gigabit speeds for a while It was great then my dad removed said wire So true tho Ive told so many people to do this over the years finally glad someone did it Ive been using a tlink adapter for a wall socket and its been okay so far Much better than wifi without running cord all through the walls ive been EXTREMELY tempted to do this Please just use Powerline adapters Cable management is also important outside of the case Do it the right way and run it under your crawl space If you do this your family will be happier and people wont trip over the cord and ruin your PCconsole or the router I have noticed that mbps ethernet connection is better than a mbps WiFi connection when using remote play and steam streaming However this was not perfect and I was still having problems with compression artifacts on some steam games and I couldnt remote play PS at fps only fps Since my laptop only had a mbps ethernet I got a  USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapter from Amazon and there was a huge boost in performance Next gen Finally uses SSD Marketing  times faster than current consoles Do we even know the specs of the PS yet Id give my PC away for free if the PS was more powerful Considering my PC currently exists and i can play games on it right now Yes we dont even know the specs of PS yet No but in a few years the best graphics cards out now will be eclipsed by the new mid range ones And that will still be early in the pss lifecycle Yes Uhhh I feel attacked by this post If the rumors about next gen take em with a grain of salt are true then no  My PC is probably closer to a ps than a ps lmao In features any pc is more powerful then a ps In performance Lets first wait and see with how many lies they come just like the fake k of the current console generation Can we all just accept it doesnt fucking matter how powerful your console or pc is What matters is do you like the fucking games on it I bought a switch and its Anemonic as fuck compared to my PC with  GTX card but hey i sure as fuck cant play Super Mario Odyssey Breath of the Wild dolphin emulator wiiu addition aside or a whole host of other exclusives yet anytime soon on PC That goes the same for PS and Xbox One titled since i dont buy though Windows Store Im pretty hyped for a new Netflix box console using a mouse still tops everything for me I can run  Yes TWO Chrome tabs My PC is definitely more powerful than the PS will be Yes it is I dont need more power I need lightsabres in Skyrim and Steam Sales My mobile phone is more powerful than some pc But really no there will be better pc than any console and ability to upgrade pc in go makes pc even better than any consoles if you have good enough cpu you can keep changing gpus and rams and if you want to change cpu too you can change it Its one of most versatile thing in earth Ps specs will probably be   core zen  at ghz  at best without smt probably  Navi GPU with ray tracing performance at best probably around rx  with accerelated ray tracing   GB of RAM as xbox one x is already  GB not sure whether itll be shared with CPU or segmented  Blazing fast storage my money is on a PCI Express  nvme hybrid with common hard drive to save cost Source confirmed specs and rumour All in all its performance is around mid range specs PC if we keep in mind console optimization by dev for multiplatform games If your PC can run VR games with stable performance Id say your rig has similar or better performance than next gen console Funnily enough I think we already had this kind of performance since  for high end at least hmmmm i dont know i was told the xbox x would be faster than my pc well that turned out to be a big stinky lie If you look at all the first builds right now with their Ks and s many PC gamers will still have better graphics PC will never not be more powerful than console Its not about spec its about games No but it will still be able to run new games at lower graphics which is much better than getting no new games at all which is what happens with old consoles Probably yes I always tend to flip flop between PC and console A new console comes out its more powerful than my PC and only a few hundred quid so I get it and that becomes my main platform Then as the generation goes on my PC is due for an upgrade so I do that and inevitably its more powerful than my console so it becomes my main platform Really dont care that my pc isnt as powerful But I dont see consoles flipping between  and  screens as needed while running an old GHotas at the exact same time And still be used for more than just games Ive been running twin Radeon s old but good Im not concerned Their thermals are terrible under synthetic load but fine under game loads For some reason the thermals under  utilization by a game are much much better than under  utilization in DogeMiner They said same thing when the first console was launched huge failure against PCMR I think i should start with a pc better then the PS and then go from there o Mostly likely yes my pc is currently faster than your ps Ive been with playstation my whole life and never thought a console could surpass PC Will this finally be a console generation that has games that run smoothly without FPS drops PS games are low FPS garbage But you dont have to pay year to play online No need to get upset just look at their record xbox ps promised full hd gaming but couldnt deliver Xbox Oneps promised full p  fps but couldnt deliver Xbox one Xps pro promised full native k gaming but couldnt deliver Its all speculation but if it come neck to neck with performance level of ti or even RTX then itll be really impressive isnt the ps just a PC in a custom case running a unique operating system For real I bought an xbox one because it was more powerful than my laptop and wayyy cheaper than getting a powerful PC Yes removed Doesnt have to be You guys enjoy your K  fps  if luckyIll stay on p hz with a weaker gpu thats still plenty powerful for it Frames  resolution Doesnt matter how fast ps is it will still be built like a knock off chinese pair of beats headphones Who cares Even if it could perform as a high end PC could it would still only be able to game Its like comparing a tram to a lambo Sure it can get you from a to point b But that is the only thing it can do nbsp Unless it can run an actual OS have replaceable parts support multiple monitors support all peripherals et cetera it will not be better than a PC a  Chrome book has more features than a PS has So calm you tits Remember when the one x was supposed to do k  fps Dont fall for the hype guys What Yeah if your PC is slightly better than the PS then its probably going to be better than the PS or will take minor upgrades to do so in terms of what it can doyeah Im still not gonna upgrade my  it still runs pretty well on p so I dont care if some console after  years is more powerful lmfao Yeah thats the thing tho Pc companies make their money right away as in You buy the parts and thats it Console make their money when you buy it AND afterwards You buy a console for cheaper and then give them  bucks a year for multiplayer for example The total you pay for the amount of time that your system or console is relevant is pretty much the same though So just pick what you like Pc is generally faster and more competitive because of the fast and precise input keyboard and mouse Console is waay less complicated its awesome for sitting back and relaxing when gaming and it costs less initially so its less of a money dump to get into it Well yes it is rtx  ryzen  gb ddr its overkill af but even a more standard config can be as much or better than the ps i doubt that the ps will a  core  thread gb of ram or even something better than a  so most of the new config of today will be better than the ps Every year its the same shit a new gen coming people talking about how powerfull it will be how it will replace pc for good and every year its the same my pc still better or will be better in a year Exclusives are still a thing though A lot of PC that dont get made into the console market make sense when you need a mouse  KB since even though you CAN plug them in on a console it is not common to have MKB Not releasing on other platforms is a shitty thing to do and I simply will not buy into it yes Yes Ive still got a  super beat Counter point Mouse and keyboard  controller Yes Bruh my PCs less powerful than the PS It is because the ps doesnt exist yet I honestly just prefer using a mouse and keyboard for gaming than a controller Thats really about it TBF thats a good point Its gonna have like an i and a  at best lmao Throw in an ssd Console will never be better than pc until they stop making people pay a subscription fee to use the internet theyre already paying for in their own home That and comprehensive modding support backwards compatibility and easily replaceablerepairable hardware Until then even a pc with lower specs is more versatile and less expensive in the long run Yeah the ps is faster than PCs how much In what way k fps on what game Even then PC will still be better than a PS You dont have to pay for the online you can install mods and you can always buy a new GPU or add some RAM in case your game doesnt run that well The only thing that will probably be better at the PS will be the exclusives Maybe for a while but it wont matter in a couple of years when you cant upgrade your console and youre stuck with a laggy mess Also a console cant run CAD software or MATLAB that I need for college You can update a PC at a similar rate to the evolution of games Not so much with a console unless youre fine with  fps or below  fps if you play less demanding games Oh and I dont have to pay extra for the ability to play my games online My midrange pc shits on the PS pro and I dont need to pay an additional subscription to play online Also modding etc is horrible on PlayStation and still disappointing on the xbone Sources seem to indicate that this information is false Kotaku UKhttpwwwkotakucouknoeahasntsuddenlyremovedtherefundbuttonforbattlefrontii PCGamesNhttpswwwpcgamesncomstarwarsbattlefrontiistarwarsbattlefrontrefund Mods are investigating and will remove this thread if we are able to confirm it Alternate way to refund games including preordered oneshttpsimgurcomgalleryhCRz From the article  The refund button never existed for preordered games in the first place Seriously there are forum posts going back yearshttpsanswerseacomtTechnicalIssuesHowtocancelaPreordertdp from people not being able to get refunds on their preordered games and being told to go through customer service instead  Alternatively you can wait until the game launches at which point the refund button will appear and you can click it for a one step easy refund Basically the refund button is present for released titles not preordered ones  Here is EAs

looks like there are a lot of upset people asking for their money back What should we do Just take the button away They wont know what hit em Theyre just adding fuel to the fire at this point Remember No preorders or however it went Glad I never preordered it in the first place Im glad people are taking action and I hope we all learn that preordering shouldnt be the default action Theyre planning to implement a microtransactionbased customer service line where you pay extra money to speak to an agent quicker And the hits keep coming While I dont think Disney is remotely innocent here Im hoping this kind of backlashif it continues gaining attention is going to make them take a long hard look at their contract with EA If it gets too bad they wont hesitate to cut ties Disney is all about their public image and is very good about keeping their hands looking clean which again theyre definitely not Watch out for EAs live shat They did this one before Remember SWTOR Unsubscribe button removal Why why why why in the world would anyone ever preorder anything Especially from EA And especially given how quickly prices fall on PC games once they are released Im actually glad they did this it shows that theyre hurting and gives us more ammunition All you can do now is wait out the  minutes and remember this next time you want to preorder a game Just be mindful  be nice to the poor sap on the support call This wasnt their fault and theres a good chance theyve copped a bit of abuse today  To calm yourself while you wait watch something meditative I like Ishitani FurniturehttpswwwyoutubecomchannelUCFkqjVSUIFCHXQSQeQ youtube videos Hes just got hours of video of him planing wood and building tables and shit Very calming How low can you go EA Pay just  to unlock the refund button deleted Preordering in the first place lmao taps head Angry customers cant get refunds if we take away the refund button Also what was the point in preordering a digital game with unlimited supply I mean its one thing if there was only a physical copy Maybe EA feeds off the bad press like the cable companys in south park Ive heard that if you stay on hold for  hours you can unlock the refund button Chargeback  You get your money back from your bank  EA accrues a fee from your bank in addition to paying the bank what they earned from your initial payment  EA then has to locate your EA account and remove the game manually since it was not refunded via their appwebsite Winning Edit pls ban me mods Preorder culture at its finest This is a rare time when we see what kind of issues a game has before it releases and a mixture of uproar and bandwagoningmetooing has shown just how few actually live by the idea of not preordering Though chances are slim I hope this shows people why you dont preorder games I have a feeling most wont learn the lesson though STOP PURCHASING EA GAMES FOR AT LEAST  YEARS AND ADD  YEAR FOR EACH TIME THEY FUCK OVER THE CUSTOMER The ONLY way to change this unethical shit is for them to no longer receive money for it Yes that means you need to stop purchasing EA games ALL of them removed Thats REALLY fucking shady The intent is to provide customers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for acquiring a refund How on earth anyone EA would think it would be a good idea to make it more difficult for people to cancel HAHAHAHA cant even imagine the shit storm at EA offices now Lesson is dont preorder Stay with it guys get that cancellation A part of me a cynical part is very glad they did this Because if you preordered an EA game you fully deserve to jump through hoops to get your money back You are the reason the gaming industry is going where its going I am glad you have to waste your time and I only wish it was longer than  hour  TLDR Dont preorder games or face the consequences when you do Doesnt make EA less scummy but you reap what you sow And fucking idiots still buy their games and preorder This is why they are still in business Stupid people and their money are soon parted Live shat is accurate lol removed If this doesnt work I picture an executive frantically hitting the processing servers with a baseball bat to halt refunds Why would you preorder in first place  scared to run out of digital copies or something Ive been boycotting EA for years now but I kind of want to preorder just so I can cancel it Please gaming community rember this We have to let EA die No matter how good their next trailers look dont buy the games Send a message to every other publisher that were sick of their bullshit lack of effort and loss of sight of what we the gamers want and that if they try to push shitty loot boxes on us well let their company die too I have a pretty valid question Why did all you dumbfucks preorder in the first place Its digital download they arent gonna run out of copies Or were you guys REALLY impressed with some lame preorder exclusive shit like a hat for Luke or some shit I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment with every hour wasted for not buying this game Dont have to try and find the refund button if you never preorder One word Chargeback Quick reminder that you can also perform a chargeback with your credit card company if you paid with a CC I was going to preorder since it looked so promising My friends warned me against it though and now Im so glad that I listened to them I think EA is forgetting one big thing They arent ComCast and people can actually say no to them and go to other games if their service is shit i thought we all agreed to never preorder after the no mans sky incident Greed is good  EA This is what my account looks like httpsiimgurcomSMpWtGpng Beautiful aint it Do we really need the this is why we dont preorder games speech The AMA on Wednesday is going to be fucking fantastic EA just wants to instill a sense of accomplishment in you when you cancel Maybe we shouldnt preorder in the first place  Lets also take note These are the new games that will be coming out by EA lets be sure to not buy them Anthem A Way Out Fe SIMS  FIFA  NHL  NBA  Madden  Need for Speed Payback UFC  I am happy that I got my money back yesterday in just  minutes  I felt bad for the person that assisted me though as I knew theyd have to do this over again with the next person and maybe even get shit on even though they cant do anything and just want to go home from work To all the people who attacked us cursed us and defended EA against us for criticising BF preordered and only now have deleted their post history and jumped on the bandwagon Spend my money the way I want Im going to preorder just to spite Reddit Haha Youre some suckers I dont feel bad for you whatsoever in the slightest And to top it off Fucking told you so Solution stop buying EA regardless if they change their business model Im not even gonna bother anymore The only people affected by this whole ordeal are the idiots that for some reason still buy EA games They deserve to be ripped off Honestly Serves you dumbfucks right for even preordering an EA title in the first place Banker here This is why everyone should have a credit card Preorder with your credit card and when the charge goes through call up your card company and do a chargeback This only affects people who preordered Seems like a good lesson for them to learn I swear one of the first rules of PCMR is dont preorder I swear people ignore it everytime and then get bamboozled Ive fallen behind on this  what is going on with SWBII Or is it just EA being crappy Maybe if you all would stop preordering every piece of shit thats release Honestly who would have predicted Kevin Spacey would have a true competitor for worst PR disaster of  in such a short amount of time Honestly fuck people who still preorder You deserve it Ive been saying for years that EA are cunts and every time Ive mentioned it Ive been downvoted Since  I havent bought a single one of their games new and wont for a very long time Glad to see the majority of Reddit is coming around and finally seeing these scumbags for what they are even if its just because its the current circle jerk With their now unfamous comment at k various other comments about it from their community team account all beneath k their community manager tweeting thishttpsiimgurcomKDwGGVgpng on his private Twitter and then being confused about backslashhttpstwittercomsledgehammerstatus DICEs design director basically confirming the grind four hours after EA unfamous comment finally are some changes happening  New post from DICEs design director in rStarWarsBattlefront  New articlehttpswwweacomgamesstarwarsbattlefrontbattlefrontnewsswbfiichangeslaunch from EA So were reducing the amount of credits needed to unlock the top heroes by  E Pastebin text with links I am sending to people asking about it httpspastebincomTxMRY This is stupid I cannot refund my order Never ordering an EA game again Just gonna say if is this Australian dollars which seems to be the case this is very illegal Its why we now have a refund option on Steam Send a complaint to the ACCC they get shit done This is why you dont preorder You were told over and over again not to put your hand in the fire Now you got burned I dont feel bad at all for the people wholl now have to learn a tough lesson and waste their time having to sit on the phone with EA to get their hardearned money back Hopefully this serves as a lesson both to them and to the people still on the fence about putting their hands in that preorder fire  especially with a company like EA Isnt this normal for pre orders You can usually refund them any time before the game releases and afterwords it generally requires an contacting support I ammalmost positive this is always hows its worked but its been a while since i have pre ordered anything Ea also has s pretty generous refund policy compared to other platforms Guys dont hold me to this and I need to do some further research but this may breach Australian consumer law The total in the OP is in AUD Again its just gone midnight and I have to go to work so Ill need to research it or you guys can throw up ideas might be worth the original OP making a complaint to the ACCC I have not played a EA title since the SPOREOrigin fiasco in  and i have to say i still get a grin on my face when EA gets cought in their schemes I still dont get how people are still buying their shit though but i guess new idiots get born every day deleted WHY DO YOU FUCKING PREORDER the AMA tomorrow is going to be a blast Though this will be buried lets remember to not buy their games ever again Even if we succeed with this current boycott under the premise we are there may come a time where theres this oh so heartfelt apology to the community about their behavior and how remorseful they feel about dong this to customers blah blah blah No positive statement or action will be genuine and taking it as such and giving back their customer base will only exculpate whats already been done It sets us up for the trap again in the future And theyve only learned a new business strategy on how to keep doing this in the future deleted Just waiting for them to add a cancelation fee of  uEACommunityTeam The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for cancelling their preorder after waiting  minutes to chat with someone from our support team I had this problem with Andromeda Last EA game I will ever own My own fucking fault I never should have given them a fucking dime Shame They pulled the exact same shit with The Old Republic and even hid the unsubscribe button i dont care if this is fake or not this is hilarious I work for EA Customer Support Things are so fucked right now you have no idea If you used paypal use its refund deleted Those who preordered the game in the first place are fucking idiots Zero sympathies for them deleted Dont stop make your voices heard Thats unbelievably scummy What the shit EA What happened Why is everyone canceling their preorder The hubris of big tech companies is getting out of hand  EA Blizzard Apple etc etc they all just treat their customers like garbage addicts who will keep coming back no matter what Long gone are the days of customer satisfaction and winning peoples business You assholes need to stop preordering and buying this shit You do it every goddamn year and then raise hell when the obvious happens And then post for karma and repeat The only way youll learn is if you cant refund this shit Why buy it in the first place Warning signs everywhere Fucking dip This AMA is going to be great Okay I think I can see the problem This looks like a screenshot of Origin a malicious program that is thankfully found on fewer and fewer machines these days Stay winning EA Yesh We would like to extend our condolences to TotalBiscuits loved ones Much more than an influence to PC Gaming John Bain was a human being and his absence will be felt by those who were closest to him Losing a loved one is never easy but losing a loved one before their time is one of the greatest pains a human being can feel Cancer especially makes us feel desperate and helpless If youd like to perhaps extend a hand of support to those suffering with such an affliction consider donating to a charity Genna Bain Johns wife has suggested Bowel Cancer

civil in commenting on this thread deleted Even when you knew this was coming it doesnt make it any easier to process RIP the guy who brought me to the greatness that is the PC His tweet from two days ago made it seem like he was doing better God damnit Rest In Peace TB Man I wanna spread the news but kinda dont want to press that button that says glorious RIP the world will be a lesser place without him deleted Even though it has expected its still so unbearably heartbreaking to hear Hes critiquing heaven now Catch ya later bud Even when we knew it was coming its still incredibly sad to hear Thank you John listening to him through Warcraft Radio all those years ago progressing into Starcraft with him and finally being where i am today because of him I was lucky enough to have an interview spot with him at Dreamhack  Without that interview spot and without that meeting id have never gone to meet my cameraperson for that event the camera operator went on to become my wife My best to Genna and MiniBain To quote his favorite game He was a good man what a rotten way to die Rest in peace he will be missed Damn that hurts to read Gaming just lost one of its champions F see you later space cowboy I thought he would have had a little more time left RIP He was one of the nicest most genuine people Ive met in my time in the industry No doubt his genuine nature and honesty is why so many were fans of his content No matter the topic if he spoke on it you knew you were getting an honest and well thought out response from him and could trust his opinion This hit me like a truck Started watching him when I was  years old Wow RIP Fought cancer all the fucking way a true inspiration Youll be missed TB May you LUL in heaven No matter your opinion of him you cant argue he didnt have a massive impact on the evolution of games media He helped to revolutionize the way we follow this hobby online and people will continue to talk about his contribution to gaming as a whole for decades to come RIP TB My thoughts are with his family If you have never watched him on the h post cast here is a short bit talking about living with stage cancerhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvOzbrchxAts Get your colonoscopies when you need em guys They really are fucking easy I have to get them every    years and honestly it sounds so much worse than it is Fuck what a bummer At least hes no longer in discomfort RIP The Cynical Brit He lasted much longer than the doctors initially believed he would The guy had such a good attitude about it too He went down swinging Fuck Rest in peace my brother  This still feels like a shot in the gut Even when I disagreed with him on some random personalpolitical issue I still revered this mans ethic and integrity to the nth degree The PCMR has lost a great warrior today Im not actually sure what more to say it just hurts RIP to the greatest game review around All those times we thought he beat it RIP man I knew it was coming but not this fast Fuck Ive been watching his content for a quarter of my life I always admired him as the golden standard in games journalism He fought for what he thought was right even while fighting cancer at the same time You put up a good fucking fight TB now its time to rest Ill be going back and watching him and Jesse play Terraria from back in the day I think Seems fitting to watch one of the classics I was not expecting him to go so quick after his last announcement  Thats a thing I didnt expect to pop up on my Twitter today Eventhough I didnt follow him all that much Rest in Peace Ill always think of him whenever I change my FOV Manthis is so sad to hear Rest in peace TB F Genna has to know how many people hes touched and what a positive change he made on the community I know shes probably devastated but I hope that knowledge brings her heaps of comfort going forward He was a class act until the end RIP John Man This man got me into PC gaming Probably one of the first you tubers I subscribed too Shit sucks Rest In Peace brother Fuck me I rarely ever comment but this hit me hard I thought he looked better lately He fought a brave battle he was destined to loose but hell live on in our hearts His cynical communitiys hearts What a journey Rest in peace We lost another great man in the gaming industry F The linked tweet was tweeted by GennaBainhttpstwittercomGennaBain on May    UTC  Retweets

perspective where you never know what hand life will deal you Good bad young or old Cancer just doesnt give a damn PC gaming lost an icon today But fear not brothers and sisters He is no longer suffering Where he is his frames will never drop nor stutter His field of view goes on forever His temps will always be cool His resolutions are picture perfect and his custom loops will never leak Pumps wont break no more blood sacrifices to heat sinks He will never have to read codes off his motherboards and his chair will always be comfortable He is downloading games at pb a second But most importantly hes no longer in pain Everyone play a game for TB today Celebrate his contributions to the PC community and always ALWAYS remember If something doesnt feel right Go get checked out He ascended past PCMR RIP Never got into him or his videos but its still sad when death happens RIP John Bain o Damn I loved this dudes videos when I was first getting into pc gaming I might have not agreed with his most recent opinions but he still was one of the most entertaining youtubers ever Fuck cancer always taking what we hold dear but thats the reality We saw this coming but processing no pun intended sorry this is still hard PepeHands F Having lost someone close to cancer I know how much it sucks Losing a loved one is never easy nor should it be But the memories that they forged with their time together are memories they will cherish forever I can just hope all the best for his family RIP TotalBiscuit Noooo this is sad  this is just purely fucking sad may he rest well and have his journey remembered as a great one We lost an intelligent humble enjoyable and helpful human Theres a  gaming YouTube personalities but theres a reason he was near the top in terms of recognition and anyone in this thread knows why Fuck everything and this sadly expected news Whenever we would sit down to work on any number of our incomplete games one of my friend and Is biggest dreams once it was finished was to see TB review it We knew that would never come to be when he started talking about his cancer but this is still unexpected to read and hurts even though Ive never even met the man My heart goes out to Genna Fuck Cancer John will be missed Holy fuck Ive been out of this community for a while as other things in my life have become more important and My schedule is tighter but oh my god this hit me I loved watching total biscuits videos when I was really getting into PC gaming and just gaming in general I just sat here for about  minutes with my mouth wide open with shock I knew about him having cancer and how bad it was I just never thought itd happen RIP total biscuit the guy that basically introduced me to one of the things that I hold very close to my heart I know it doesnt mean much but I send all of my condolences to his family and friends Another one gone too soon Not quite the same as pressing F but Ive made a memorialhttpsiimgurcomEPiZotgjpg too for him Only way I knew how really What a terrible day for rain today I own Bad Rats because of him Gods Im going to miss him One of my favorite people on the internet Whose opinions were always well grounded in reason and logic Ones I could count on to give perspective to my own Supremely funny content and an all around genuine human being He will be missed sorely F I didnt keep up to date with him super recently didnt know the end was so close or even certain Even when he got really bad news he was always determined to fight it and hope for survival What hes contributed to the PC Gaming community wont be forgotten an amazing guy all around Ive known this day was coming for years now but still shit RIP  FUCK Fuck fuck fuck The last CoOptional just went up too Fuck this one hurts Damn RIP Rest in Peace F Very sad day He will be missed greatly So soon When we got the message a few weeks back I thought it would be at least a couple months before seeing this Damn it man Poor guy I was just recently looking at his twitter and almost all of the tweets in his final days were talking about living in constant agony RIP Totalbiscuit your pain is finally over  His videos helped me switch to PC RIP Bummer He brought and demanded a higher standard of games and game journalism Im sorry for his family loss and the gaming community has lost a legend Man this sucks Rest in peace Rest in peace you Legend RIP Loved to watch him and he got me into buying a PC My condolences to family members and friends Rest easy Totalbiscuit Rest in Greatness Buddy Goodbye TB you have done so much for PC gaming We shall forever remember you in our hearts and in our rigs F Goddamn this one stings I hadnt followed him much these past few years Ill fondly remember him as the guy who cared so much about games he would spend  minutes talking about their menu options Rest in peace brother  RIP Totalbiscuit You were essentially the reason I fell in love with PC gaming You ARE the reason that I have such high standards for the games I choose to buy May your framerates be high and your temperatures low Can I just say this FUCK Cancer I never really watched his videos but his positive influence on the gaming community as a whole was too big to explain in words Hes helped dozens if not hundreds if not thousands of people from casters to developers pro gamers and content creators get a footing in the industry It makes me tear up to see venemous people on twitter to go to lengths as to celebrate the death of a truly great individual whos touched the lives of millions in one way or another John worked harder in unimaginable pain and suffering than ive ever worked in my entire life And as a person even not knowing him personally that drive makes his death fill me with a very heavy sadness Thanks for everything John we already miss you Rest in Peace John always said shitty console ports have no FOV adjustment and their FOV is very narrow Guess what tears also make for a very narrow FOV God damn Rest easy you fought hard Rest in peace you glorious bastard The Emperor will know his own Im very sorry for being ignorant I hope he rests in peace but who was he Get Checked If Symptoms Appear No Matter What He repeated that message over and over the last few years he waited too long because he thought he was young enough to be safe and was too embarrassed to get checked It might have been preventable otherwise Damn  I just wish it didnt happen so soon after his last announcement There was just so much he gave us Damn Rest in Piece John I really respected him He was a true hero Cancer sucks  He always called out the shitty practices of the Gaming industry I have so much respect for what he did Memento Mori  Hey uwickedplayer This is now the top post on reddit It will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts I used to play World of Warcraft with John in Vanilla  TBC before he was huge on YouTube I had a mutual friend who also played WoW with him who wanted to make YouTube videos and TB helped him learn how to make videos and went a step further by inviting him onto his showchannel and promoting his new YouTube channel in the description Ill never forget how happy he made my friend when he was telling me about it He gained my admiration for that kind gesture he looked out for his friends RIP John The man who said what had to be said without worry about the backlash of the developers that fueled his livelyhood The man who stood up for the consumer and believed that noone should be taken advantage of within the gaming industry throughout its beggining to where we are today The man i looked up to for many years admired and respoected I never thought i could possibly be upset by the passing of someone who i had never personally interacted with but now i realise he has a special place in the lives of many and not only a few Your work will shape the world far beyond your death RIP John Bain My condolences to the Bain family and to everyone who invited Totalbiscuit into your homesscreensbattlestationspodcast subscriptions Just to note at the great reach of a man lost too soon as of  Central time US the top  posts in rall are dedicated to John Totalbiscuit Bain For as much as I disagreed with him on some things he said and did I will never deny he was a great hero that stood for all of us when it counted I honor his memory and wish his family the best May you rest in peace TB  I feel kind of silly but not embarrassed that I am a bit choked up We lost a good man but at least his pain has finally ended Fuck cancer Whether you liked him or not he definitely has a place in gaming history and will be missed I didnt personally agree with him on most things but he always produced quality videos and deeply cared about this hobby Rest in piece battle brother Wow This is rough news I will never unsubscribe from any of his channels One of my favorite Internet personalities and game reviewers As cancer rate rises i still dont understand why it not consider as pedemic at this point May his frames be high and his temperatures low in RGB heaven Pretty sad day And honestly pretty scary too The man was like  years younger than me Im going to listen to his  second Mixtape on soundcloud that says stop preordering video games TB made me a part of PCMR Truly a sad day May we up our frames in his memory Never forget Critique exists to protect consumers from unscrupulous companies and is a necessary part of our society Thank you John Could I get the MSI monitor itself without the stand for  The stand is obviously the less expensive option Why pay  more for a monitor too Includes a stand specifications on monitor advertising looks to be a new Industry standard includes a stand This must be the work of an enemy Stand Apple just launched the best viral marketing for multiple different oems China guys will sell exact copy for  can you put your own moniter on the stand Well the pro stand is cheaper Isnt hdr  barely even hdr the more of these I see the more I believe Apple intentionally made a ridiculous prize price so that everyone talks about it as free advertisement I still cant use these awesome powers as advertised What happened to getting an invisible ghost with an ability of some sorts like stopping time erase space create zippers on anything restore objects to their previous state use the power of gravity change bullet trajectories I dont have any of that Falsely advertised I wish my stand for my reference monitor only cost a grand I worked in an editing house for years My monitor was  and my stand was about  Best part I was an audio engineer Got some hand me down stuff I dont know the quality of this stand But do your research What people pay in editing houses for video is OBSURD Apple was not trying to sell to consumers here Picture this the seat in an Indy car probably costs more than your car And its less comfortable than the average cars seat Function sometimes costs a LOT of money I cant stand apple Can I just get the display for  I dont need a stand deleted is this for real Apple has a k fuking stand People will buy it toogenius Love how people think these are consumer machines Hahahahaha These are not for us These are for movie studios and professional environments I mean to be fair the Mac Monitor is simply better with a sustained brightness of  nits and is a K screen plus has superior color accuracy Its like comparing a Ferrari to an Acura NSX I think the bigger problem is that the Mac Monitor is aimed at such a niche market In comparison it goes up against some reference monitors that are truly are K however only a handful of people actually need a reference editing monitor So yeah the monitor and especially the stand are a joke but just try and find a similar monitor to it at less than kk includes a stand I have a feeling many companies will now start using this term Can i buy the monitor from MSI alone I dont want their  stand just the monitor id like to point out that the matte version of the display costs  dollar more so to get a matte coating which is standard in the high quality display industry with different levels on coating of course apple charges u  dollars more they are selling u a  dollar display as a glossy shit without a stand to have a matte proper version with stand puts u at  dollars a lot of people might have missed this beauty of a middle finger from apple because everyone jumped on the stand madness D A lot of people kinda are missing the point Apple didnt build this monitor and stand for the everyday user Its called the Pro Display for a reason and a lot of professional users actually swap monitors fairly often Thats also the reason this stand isnt included with the base package I mean if you look at its direct professional competitors most of the monitors come at a  and more price tag That makes  for the whole package actually fairly decent Professional gear simply costs a shitton more than your standard consumer gear This whole thing is aimed at perhaps the  of users Apple did absolutely botched the way they announced it tough Now compare the actual monitors Lots of good reasons to buy the MSI option then But youre saying Id save  by buying the one on the left That makes it harder Misleading marketing What MSI isnt telling in their clever little ad is that Apples stand is made from the Horn of a Unicorn That monitor is a PC I shoved this stand up my butt it cured by homosexuality Apple just need to add a dollar to the price then it would be a grand stand Well they actually just released a cheaper version httpsimgurcomFvTvijpg Hot take If they had just raised the price of the monitor to  and included the stand no one would be complaining Apple is going to sue MSI for this but the judge will rule that Apple lacks standing Why people are so personally offended by the damn stand is beyond me Anyone whod buy something as frivolous as they clearly has the money to burn As for everyone else is not as if youre being required to buy stuff like that At Apples board meeting Tim CookWell bois we have an almost saturated market of cellphones our shareholders want money and were NOT about to get it from our savings SMITHERS What do we have in the queue Smithers Well sir we have that new line of Mac Computers and k monitors coming Tim Cook Silence Ive heard enough goon to the factory and take out all the stands from the monitors Smithers YES SIR Do you want us to destroy them as we go Tim Cook No you dim wit repackage them well sell it to them for  each Smithers  each It cost us  to manufacture one I think thats too far Tim Cook I SAID  They will buy it because we say so Mwhaaa ha ha ha Executives break in evil Apple laughter I worked out that you could fly to America from England rent a car and hotel for a week buy literally the best gaming pc money can buy an expensive keyboard mouse sound system microphone headset and   monitors fly back to England pay someone to build the pc for you then STILL have money left over for the amount that it costs to buy the tower stand and monitor for that pc Insane This would be more brutal if it hadnt taken MSI so long to develop a website that looks like it was designed in  on word I honestly feel bad for the guy presenting that day Wait apple is selling a stand for a G Meanwhile at Youtube DIY Pro Stand for  The apple monitor is for professional videophoto editing but still the stand is a joke Also dont upvote its at k Now compare the monitors A  stand made in China that probably costs  to make But they need it to be nne professional If im a tech company with a proven dumb loyal customers I would not charge a stand for  Id charge it for  Theyd still buy it anyway Dumb  Loyal are pretty hard to beat I get what they are trying to do but seriously the the XDR iMac pro display is in a whole other universe when compared to this monitor Not trying to defend this  stand just saying that this  monitor doesnt even come close to the  apple one The Mac Pro isnt meant for just anyone its meant for professionals who use a computer for a living like editors etc they already pay thousands for some equipment You can use the right one on a mac pro right includes a stand INB JoJo fans Apple sitting back and watching everyone on the internet mentioning their products So much free advertising happening I believe this was  their intention As someone out of the loop and confused  is Apple making new iMac buyers buy a stand separately now If people would quit buying their outrageously priced shit we wouldnt have this problem Screw this next monitor will be MSI Savage burn wait i thought this istand shit was a meme and not an actual product D D D I say let the editor and his assist keep their Mac They match the receptionist and it looks good for clients Never mind that hard work happens in the dungeon where the light does not shine and neither do the monitor stands When we found out that the imac was wall mountable but you cant remove the standI was irate This this is fucking funny hahaha  Hey unatewu This is now the top post on reddit It will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts some third party will make a much more affordable stand for the pro display so everything will go back to normal soon The sad and funny thing is that dumbasses will still buy it and Best Buy will make shit ton from it Im actually embarrassed for Apple Still trying to figure out why anyone would want a k monitor especially for  FUCKING DOLLARS  a stand thats  I still cant believe that there are idiots who buy Apple products and their excuse for paying the high price is but the high price means that it is a quality product crap I hear all the time I can spend a grand on college textbooks stack them up put the monitor on top and bingo youve got yourself an apple stand pc yes monitor no Solitaire Sudoku Bomberman yes literally anything from last decade nope I feel like this is a subreddit full of bragging so lemme just say mine does ultrawide hz My PC laptop canmy external monitor cant Dont forget  fps on a  Hz TV What Rez k UHD hz Terraria Pc yes Tv yes Laptop yes But my phone and tablet are SOL Cries in a fluctuating  to  fps laughs in my flair removed I dont know about anyone else but I was playing Quake  at fps in  deleted Depending on game and graphic settings Consoles wont reach FPS in anything Its like saying they support RayTracing and K that does not mean that you get that its just possible in theory I bought my shit when it was more powerful than consoles and now Im slipping behind so I dropped the whole master race shtick Ill care again when I actually am able to get more parts in a few years Then again these consoles are gonna be like  bucks hz gsync baby Itll probably be at like x resolution Yes Yes yes it can Theres a lot of PCs that can get fps if you lower the settings enough lmao Actually yeah on ultra low settings Yeah because theres a ton of offerings in the hz tv market Why do I relate to this MY pc monitor can do  Such a glorious thing Bitch Im at  My wallet took this personal Yes I need a hz monitor for real for real Consoles are going to halfass fps the same way they halfass k They can barely struggle to hit  in many cases I sincerely believe if they ever do  itll only be select games will likely not be true like they might use interlacing and stealthily change the definition to be fields per second or itll be at the cost of resolution or quality Worse itll likely be nothing but a gimmick anyway since outside of select speciality monitors I cant see TVs embracing fps anytime soon Not when we have people saying it doesnt matter anyway saying the eye cant see more than  and all our media is normally at  anyway If people put up with the frankly garbage frame rates of cinema they will put up with anything I get way more than  On minecraft Run Yes Efficiently No Yes my pc can My monitor can run  fps And its fucking glorious depends on the game bud Sure I run at Hz all the time Q Can YOUR PC run  fps A Yes Better question Can YOUR SCREEN run  fps The screen is easily one of the most overlooked pieces of a gaming setup Even now in  theres still people that wonder Are monitors over hz really worth it  months ago Dont worry he was enlightened Had to remove the link because of automod rule  violation Ive been gaming since  Who the fuck cares These silly things are just that silly things Console PC Mac whatever if you enjoy it do it still gonna stick with just Nintendo and PC PC because variety Nintendo because fun and JESUS FUCK I WANT MORE KIRBY GAMES AAAA But  of console gamers play on screens with hz refresh rates soooo laughs as I get  fps on csgo but my monitor can only get  fps Depends on the game tbh I dont know anyone who can run black desert online on ultra mode in more than  fps Tho games like shadow warrior  you can easily run fps on a i  and a gtx  fps when looking to the sky on Minecraft HAHA Yelp We need to pull out fps Laughs in  FPS I get fps on the Grim Dawn loading screen This would mean tvs implementing hz displays which is kinda sick for all of us I know Nvidia released those big tvs but if they wanna sell to console gamers theyll need to drop the price Mine does fps easily as does my monitor XFHUA I also only have a GTX  Doesnt matter though as I primarily play CSGO so my system is perfectly balanced for my use case No but it runs hz which is ok hz monitor at fps years agofelt like I was cheating when I started using it for FPS After watching Chernobyl last month I had to run through Stalker SOC again Was playing at a solid fps the whole way through Absolutely glorious again depends on the program lol so yes for most people the bottleneck with be the display but i can confirm hz is great when i can hit it Yes yes it can I dont get ithttpsiimgurcomHXlLjpg If I crank it down to console resolution yes yes yes it can The best thing about this is making high refresh rate televisions more standard and economical Yes With shit graphics but yes I remember going down in skill going from CRT to LED Input lag and shit Then going up in skill when from hz to hz Now give me a CRT with hz already thank you  FPS GSync D yes mine can Yes actually hz monitor GTX  mini Minimum of  FPS for like a second every now and then max of  FPS going from ps to hz k was just amazing TT Well it runs  so yes D PC reaches  but my monitor is p Hz thanks for asking No it runs at  Yes but I mainly play Stardew Valley or Devolver games Yes actually all three p monitors at once at fps has been achieved in some games even There are very few PC games out there that also play on console and that wont run  FPS on a rather basic gaming PC  if you set the game to the same quality the console offers When ur pc gets FPS but you have a  hertz monitor p hz baby Granted its on medium settings deleted I run a hz monitor and if I drop below  I notice Yes my monitor runs  and my pc gets  I can run minecraft at fps With shaders Ohhhhh yeah fps low settings all the way baby No sorry only fps Yes and its pretty affordable because I buy parts intelligently for the specific project Im building Yes fps on a hz freesync monitor haha Lets be honest  is harder than it needs to be because devs dont optimize for PC like they should Its not gonna matter anymore soon With high density high refresh rate displays coming both desktop and console are gonna go obsolete eventually Imagine a  TV with a resolution of p and a refresh rate of hz  or AR goggles that let you create a movie theater in your living room  or VR with resolution so fine the screen door effect ceases to exist Less than  years people Less than  years until youll scoff at the terms p or fps Im so fucking excited Edit video for those interested httpsyoutubeogQSQKxc My PC can run  monitors at fps simultaneously Now it finallllllllly can Lol im not paying  to run fps Depends on the game Yeah i think that my  might be able to reach it My modded minecraft is at  fps Sadly no   But maybe your console might not be able to run it as well I played Quake  at Hz all the time You think Hz these days is smooth Hz on a CRT is somethin else Yep Good old x my pc can even get  fps in some games sadly my tv got only Hz yes   is perfect for the home Many nonbudget TVs can handle hz Input lag will still be an issue but Im honestly happy for the peasants and gaming community as a whole because of this move Laughs in hz ULMB No it runs  fps Next question My PC could get  FPS depending on the game well before it died anyway Monitor is still only hz tho  Thats nothing I get  FPS css Oof I dont understand this meme cuz i didnt knew there was an area below  fps Yes mine can My potato runs at a max of  fps on single player games As for online Im happy if it can stay above  and thats on lowest possible graphical settings On a good day it can go up to  or more for about  seconds Yup hz monitor and can run over watch on ultra at fps easy work But what about the  fps every second we cant see I still gotta pay for those Yes Yes and yes  Yes it can It can do  fps in the FIFA loading screen  baby I had  fps in quake  Stable  FPS in ds U wot mate Yes it can actually After so many years on hz its so weird thinking back to playing xbox  at low fps I cant even imagine getting into a shooter without it laughs in low graphics settings Yes It can and it does run above fps And so did my previous pc that was years old As someone with a  and a p hz monitor I find it hard to believe anyone is doing over fps without sacrifices Given all the discussion surrounding if the next gen consoles hardware arent going to be outdated aka considered lowend by their release then they would have lots of spare power for devs to give options like PS Pro or XX Do you want performance mode Quality mode Or highres mode And I dont view it like consoles will do K andor fps I view it as consoles can support those outputs A bit like how the base PS could support only up to p but the PS Pro could support up to K Its what you can tinker with not necessarily guaranteed performance Meanwhile most nextgen console users will be using their hz TV hz ms response delay gang Well yes The meme is factually wrong Yes yes it can actually I simply dont understand how a console can do k at fps without taking a huge loss And for k now arent most games not even optimized yet Yes I can run games on ultra settings on x at fps Yeah and if I set the graphics quality as low as console games Id pull fps But ultra settings and vsync set I get fps laughs in hz monitor Thats Not how the npc meme works Only hz PC no monitor no laptop nah I can never go back to hz I love ultrawides and miss it but way to expensive for a hz p monitor So I miss it but it feels so choppy to play anything at hz anymore Almost every gaming machine can quite easily by turning settings down Remember kids Ultra is for screen shots high is for gameplay As a pc gamer I can bang that out in  hours Me taking leave Alright time to catch up on some gaming Also me either watches YT or stares at my steam library not knowing what to play Thats just the warm up period When i was doing a web design course a few years ago we had to do a presentation on something social related for some reason This one girl talked about video game addiction She

memories of all time Winds howling Plays Borderlands  for  hours straight only breaking to go to work because screw you sleep For a  yo its quite an unhealthy practice nothing wrong about playing for h but better take long pauses in between h or so and not do it every day People work for  hours a day and nobody bats an eye Yeah thanks classic wow You mean like Earth hours or As an unemployed PC gamer anything less than  hours is weaksauce I have found the time I spend on video games to have decreased significantly after age  or  When I do play it will be for a good length of time Responsibilities catch up with you man let me tell you My gf and I have been avid gamers since we started going out When we first moved out we would spend countless hours and overnighters on killing floor sanctum and borderlands I left for the army at  and when I came home  months later after training it was like the fast forward button was hit and then suddenly everyone was too busy My gf and I still played though for longer hours than everyone else My fulltime job and other hobbies have cut into my game time but Im glad they did It lets me focus on a little of everything Makes me more appreciative when I do get to play Since BL was announced my gf and I have been working our way through the series We finished the story on  and working through the DLC now Im guessing by the time  comes to steam is when we will be ready for it When I first got skyrim on steam I had  hours played in  days  complete days out of  wasted on skyrim no regrets hr dota marathon Its long for a  year old Once you turn  it goes out the window There are weeks when Id be lucky to get  hours in total but when the chance arises I can pump out  hours a day easy If people actually tracked their leisure time I think theyd be super surprised  Dawg Im at an antisocial part of my life and all I do is sleep exercise work and game like fuck people I get my stuff done during the day and bury myself in my room until the next sunrise U guys forget that the boy is  lol But lets ignore the people who will watch the office friends etc all day TV addiction isnt something people talk about People talk about video game addiction and then turn around and spend even more time if not twice that amount watching Netflix browsing Facebook reading any number of mindless activities that require much less thinking than video games What a noob I spend that much time just choosing what game to play Hes a noob not an addict Those are noob numbers Gotta pump those numbers up those are rookie numbers in this rackethttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxHTnyUwt Took me another  years to discover WoW I think  hours was a schoolday minimum back then easily  hours in the weekends Why are we acting like six hours a day on a NINE YEAR OLD is rookie numbers Six hours a day consistently doing anything is a lot for anybody I understand its an hobby they enjoy but just sitting down for six hours in addition to school probably another six hours sitting commutes meals homework etc pretty much means the kid aint doing anything else if they are keeping even a modest sleep schedule Hah Amateur I spent a grand on my pc because I was sick of not being able to play triple A titles and now all I do is play San Andreas I too am depressed stranger Your passion for things you love isnt gone just hiding Wow that really hit me hard af I used to have a group that I played with every night but lately it has disintegrated Really sucks to not have anyone to play with and Im too afraid of embarrassment to go into public chats Can I get an AMEN lonely gamers Im still not sure if I am depressed all games nowadays suck or maybe I am just getting older and just lost interest in games Maybe its some combination of the  but I miss looking forward to playing games all the time Me using a  console to watch Netflix I use mine to browse pcpartpickercom All I have to do is not kill myself until Halo comes out on PC That is me i buy games and never play them My attention span is so low The minute a game frustrates me I close it and never play it again I basically watch YouTube videos and browse Reddit the whole time rmeirlmeirl This has hit uncomfortably close to home Im over  I have more than capable pc and all the consoles from this and last generation More games than I could count that I never opened Subscribed to most gaming subscriptions Yet Im bored all the time Cant find anything decent to play Feeling burned out  Its like that scene from the movie Yes man you cant even summon the enthusiasm to masturbate am I right Carl removed Haha every day is wasting time until it inevitably gets the better of me and I kill myself and even material distractions cant keep the thoughts out anymore I mean me too thanks This is going to sound blasphemous as someone who loves PC gaming so much As Ive gotten older gotten married found other hobbies and had a kid Ive found that I never play PC games anymore At most Ill play the newest ps greatest hits game And even thats rare I just dont have time to sink  hours into rust or counter strike or a total war game anymore Its to much of a time commitment when I could be learning something else or spending time with my daughter I know its sad but Ive lost my PC gaming mentality Hell I barely play games anymore I did beat the latest RE remake game which was amazing But other than that I spend my time building motorcycles or gardening or building shit that will benifit the family I guess this post makes sense to me Im a lost PC gamer for now Maybe one day Ill return but not for a long time Im like this Still maintain a gaming PC just in case but I know Ill probably never run a game that needs the specs I have I hope it changes one day You should try vr if you havent It aint cheap but its fun Although I mostly use it for creativity nowadays As a former game developer I think games just havent grown up with me The target audience seems to always be the same Watching E these days Im watching kids get super excited like I used to but I dont anymore I usually see the same game I played before but with a slightly different gimmick in a slightly different package I crave a substantive experience I want to walk away thinking about that experience I want to wonder about what that life would have been like I had some of those experiences as a kid but I feel like theyre few and far between Kingdom Come Deliverance did it for me though I still think about that game after many months of not having played it Porn You forgot porn Im open to chit chat OP if you want to talk about things with a random stranger on the internet Me when I get bored of the  games I cycle around even though I have  games on my library For real though Im using my  core  threads AMD cpu for playing blitz chess A lot of people might disagree but imo the gaming industry is in a slump of shitty repetitive titles that arent really pushing many boundaries while actively trying to milk their base of all the money they can Hopefully it gets better My gpu was almost  and i do the same For me its that Ive grown interested in new hobbies Ive actually been reading a lot of novels Something  year old me now  would have scoffed at I also took up photography mostly of nature which has really improved my general mood Being alone in my room was always nice playing games doing whatever But theres something else about reading a Stephen King novel out on some hiking trail thats just Better Audio is a good investment when you do things like this  Tho xB I own a pair of Ks HD s HD  S AFK Khans HEXX Koss Porta Pro X Koss Porta Pro Wireless Final Audio Es  a pair of KZ ZSs Using a THX  with a SMSL SU balanced Speakers are RBs with a Yamaha RSBL  a Enero subwoofer Dont know the exact sub Its old Things I stopped using but still own Magni   Topping D xB ALSO I have to many mice and mousepads xB Yeah it be like that Yeah for months I would waste most of my free time on youtube or reddit My whole day would pass by and thats all i did I got sick of it so i started clearing out my steam backlog and been enjoying my free time more i was just talking to my friend about this the other day i have no idea if its games getting progressively shittier or weve grown up and our expectations became too high or something only games i play nowadays is csgo because of the competitiveness of it dont even remember the last time a single player game held my attention long enough for me to beat it UPDATE time seems to be a part of the issue i tried to play witcher  during the school year and hated it gave it another go recently and since im on summer break i have a ton of time to get immersed in the lore much better experience nd time around Frostmourne hungers Im offended by how true this is Why do we loose interest in something we love I cant figure it out Ya this is how it went when I upgraded my old pc decently Like  bucks worth of upgrades and then for a month or  after it was like Fuck Nothing to play Then I built my new one for k or something and same thing Spend so much time and fun ordering and building Its finally done and then the games you were playing a week earlier you lose all interest And nothing exciting is coming out for a few months But then after binge watching YouTube vids of stuff that entertains your for a couple weeks you get the itch to game again And man is it glorious Oof the feels and yet I feel the strong need to upgrade every  years If regular games get boring getting some stuff like joysticks racing wheels and even a VR headset can help spice things up a lot Is cause I couldnt afford a PC until I started working now work drains me so I dont feel like playing as much Sounds like you need an outdoor activity Is this a personal attack or something Isnt it ironic oof For anyone dealing with serious depression Trust me when I say I was in a bad place for a long time Please enjoy the little things and realize you only get one shot at this thing called life Love is the key fam Cheers Eh bro thats depression If youre looking for a recommendation try Monster Hunter World Alot of fun hunderts of hours of content with a big DLC coming this fall But then you get it back because Keanu Reeves said youre breathtaking That hit too close to home  can relate I bought used parts piece by piece to make my rig faster and then i got into minecraft Could have saved a shit load of money And yet I keep adding games to my library Ill probably never play How about a  machine that just plays idle flash games on kongregate Too real  Jesus I feel attacked Yea I built a PC a while back and Ive hit a point in life where all I do is work and sleep now I barely even play games anymore Youtube and reddit life lol Kinda sad rly I stopped gaming like  half year ago been spending outside and working at office very late I run workout and ride my motorcycle Its very empowering and I am also doing great in my career I recommend anyone this weekdays I come from office watch tube and eat but daily workout happens in morning Running is the best way to start a change in life as i get older learning new things feels like a chore to me even when a really good game comes out i dread playing it because id have to learn how it works it feels like work to me once i do play it i do enjoy it though almost everything adults told me when i was a child was true i am so good at learning now so i learn much faster than i did when i was a teenager but i no longer have an insatiable thirst for knowledge like i once did Right in the feels I feel you fellow human I forked out my guts for a ti in the middle of the mining frenzy I have  games on Steam wouldve been more I just stopped myself a couple years back of which I have played some GTA V BF and maybe Besiege  together about maybe five times during last year I feel personally attacked Spent  on my gaming Metabox Laptop Last game I played for  minutes  months ago was American Truck Sim Now it just plays Netflix You might need to check into anti depressants I quit playing games for awhile but now that Im on anxiety and depression meds I am enjoying them again Ive spent a hundred hours or more in each game I buy and play Historically I have logged over a thousand hours each in Minecraft and WoW Lately I have been spending all of my free time writing a novel  gigabytes of ram three monitors RGB all the things and a TI all to run Wordexe and stream study music on youtube This is literally me right now Fuck you Now I gotta get off Shit Is that Kaaris Truth hurts sometimes This was me because uni was crushing my fucking soul Now Im a grad and I actually find myself enjoying games again but I have less than zero time to play OP I thought I kind of grew out of FPS multiplayer games Turns out the game for people who are dead inside is Hearthstone After  something years Im pretty sure its called depression I used to play a bunch of games on there daily now the only one I play regularly is iRacing Its the only thing that keeps me hooked Other than that its just YouTube and Discord I used to love competetive video games like LoL and CSGO Then shit started going wrong in my life and it translated to the games so I stopped playing them no matter how much I wanted to because Id just get serious jitters thinking about losing and being bad at yet another thing I just wish I could enjoy the game without thinking about the outcome Ive tried so many times to play single play story based games with no people but I end up just thinking about PVP games while playing Depressions got a hold of me Depression I gotta break free Depressions got a hold of meee I was contemplating playing divinity original sin for the first time I should go play it It be like that all the fucking time I keep playing Overwatch I hate Overwatch its a shit game I grew up and got into game dev as a career These days the last thing I want to do when I get home is spend more time at a computer looking at games  Bruh too real  Losing sight of what brings you joy is a terrible thing And what about Discord It be like that most of the time This was me in  Its  and Im still running a  chip that sword turns into a butter knife real quick Fun tho Is this Kaaris eating stuff with Frostmourne  What the hell  I was a gamer I have a giant Steam sticker on the back of my car I have a  games backlog I have a Razer laptop and external GPU I havent played s in  months I just dont have time Fuck being an adult doing adult things So what PC games does everyone suggest Or

homeworkinternet Actual employment for many paper pushers internet pay bills etc etc and so many other things that will become a necessity for the way that people do things in ways we havent even

play ball with them They are trying to become the Exxons and British Petroleums of this resource before it even gets to that level of use Would you like to have another large bill sent to you every

entire world need to stand up to these companies that seek to position themselves to be possible tyrants If they seek and obtain the ability to charge us for every little different thing we will need access to it will stifle and slow the progress of all people in our future I feel it will severely limit our usage and growth with the medium as a whole deleted Is there anyone who isnt a politician or the CEO of a telecom company who actually wants this If we were a true democracy something like this would never see the light of day The immediate reaction is this is a bit outlandish this would not  and then you remember that this is exactly how cable TV works right now  As if Comcast would warn you before charging your account I call bullshit No way theyd have an active data left counter Instead theyd happily let you go over and charge you  per mb over Im hoping Canada doesnt go this way I cant complain about my internet right now mbps up and down they also dont seem to care about data caps because Ive gone over my TB cap a few times The internet should always remain an open and fair place I wish Google would step in on this situation Can you imagine if Google shutdown for a day and all of their pages were just a paragraph talking about Net Neutrality Google provides so much for the internet For example YouTube Gmail Google Search reCaptcha Google Drive I mean the list could go on If Google did shutdown for a day that would honestly be a big kick in the balls for companies like Comcast It would end it easily Make sure youre using a Comcast approved browser though deleted As a representative for ComcastSupport I would like to confirm that this would by no means be the screen we would use when we block reddit and other choice sites from your browser For one thing it is too simple to navigate If Net Neutrality goes the Internet will slowly cease to be what it is today Itll be like what Cable TV is today Do you want to hispeed access to Facebook Thats part of our social media package enjoy Snapchat Instagram Facebook for  or literally whatever number they want Do you want hispeed access to other websites Reddit Imgur Gmail Yahoo Business Insider Forbes Huffington Post what about general browsing Do you want to purchase our porn package get instant hispeed access to thousands of porn websites only  How about video games Youre capped at GB per month We can up that to a whopping gb per month Every GB over is  New Gears of War well that day one patch is GBs thats nearly  of your monthly bandwidth Want to watch Netflix well thats  Right now its illegal for ISPs to do this if Net Neutrality gets nuked they can do this immediately Cable Company profits are through the roof and they used taxpayer money to gain the monopolies they have Verizon received billions in tax cuts to roll out  NYC coverage which they reneged on Republican or Democrat Net Neutrality should be something youre all on board for unless you want another company reaching into your pockets to nickel and dime you when their costs are nearly nothing Its so god damn important and everyone is just distracted but its going to get us all in the end if they get this revenue stream Theres no amount of money in the world that will reverse this once those profits from this business model starts rolling in The donations theyd make the lobbyists theyd hire Both sides have to stop this now Both sides have to speak up jesus christ this is just disgusting Oh please if an extra  for reddit is going to break the bank you shouldnt be spending your time on reddit anyway Expect plenty of this Id try my best to give up on internet if this bullshit started at least id have a chance of passing my exams Saw this one on here a few weeks ago httpsiredditimbjwazizjpg deleted Comcast Your email history will be made public unless you make several millions in donations Any Congressman God damn it We shouldve kept Net Neutrality I wish Ajit Pai gets fired soon FCC is more like Fk Consumers and Customers  Ill blame the idiocy of this generation in office They work only to make their wallets fat and not for the benefit of their constituents Like how does this help us Not at all This is ignoring the part where they blame Reddit itself for not paying for Platinum Access to Basic Customers This should have been posted months ago I dont think people really understand how serious this is deleted Im pretty sure if the regulation was lifted the ISP will charge the website rather than us It would be mayhem to charge users for every visited website Google is just a search engine what about whatever link you click on Isnt deregulated internet essentially what we had for the past  years Holy shit this makes me want to hurt someone Edit Guys please dont actually hurt anyone at least not physically Channel your anger into a productive solution Spread this It will scare people has the capitalism gone too far Well lets campaign against it then Again What is this the fourth or fifth round Well force them to try again with bill  thatll show em Heads I win tails we flip again So realistically say they did this How long until another new ISP comes in and offers the internet in its current open state and steals all their customers live in Lehigh Valley have RCN RCN didnt release names of IP address owners even when authorities had court orders Magnets If you want to do something about this vote in  Take a look at the candidates on your ballot a few months prior to the election Vote early if you can I still cant believe that some people in Congress still think this is a good idea Its very onedimensional thinking If we remove governments influence on business the market will fix itself In some instances this is true In this instance you are literally allowing any ISP that wants to decide where you can go and charge you to go anywhere else Losing current regulations will have exactly ZERO benefits to consumers Just seeing this infuriates me Nonononononononononononononononnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooo deleted Is that what Net Neutrality actually is preventing I thought that they want to make it so that ISPs have to pay them more for a service How do we know that there will be plans for internet How can that be enforced for the millions and millions of different websites out there So why didnt this happen before net neutrality then My anus just snapped shut All thanks to this douchehttpthehillcomsitesdefaultfilesstylesthumbsmallarticlepublicpaiajitgnleadjpg Yup Cant wait until the internet is like cable Can I torrent internet Is this a real possibility Google Fiber save us You wouldnt need net neutrality if local governments didnt allow regional monopolies to form essentially stifling competition and creating a barrier to entry to the market that a new company can barely afford The entire problem of broadband in America is the result of this regional regulation Now everyone wants to fix the problem bycreating more regulation Do you not see the problem here ITT Wow theres some really uninformed people on PCMR That does not bode well for the future Or more realistically everyone is forced to use a VPN which will be super annoying and add latency unreliability and other complexities All thats gonna happen is people are not gonna pay the extra for shit and realize there is outside and then they will lose money and then everything will go back to normal Thats pretty scary idea deleted Fuck this Learn about us and our historyhttpspcmasterraceorghistory PCMR isnt just a subreddit but a very

the sense of achievement EA its in the game all game content unlockable through additional purchases Only  credits I could get that in like  hours easy Heres to hoping this is one shitstorm we never let EA live down Let the memes roll on for months and repost on every social media platform Bonus points if Disney gets roped into the bad press because they will rip EA a new one for the IP damage theyve caused inb a cookie clicker game that resolves around unlocking the EA logo in that state in steam with achievements  EDIT I should have went to bed hours ago but heres my iilustrator look  its WIP but I will be uploading all changes in there httpsimgurcomaPHtz How much can I pay to remove their logo entirely Thats something worth saving up for EA Sports Its not in the game Hey but lets not forget about that Old EA sports sayinghttpsyoutubesyxUHDZTq EA Its in the game You just cant use it Remember when EA said theyd change to become a player firsthttpswwwgamespotcomarticleseaceosayscompanyischangingtobecomeplayerfirst company What they meant was Players pay first then pay some more afterwards I cant wait for EAs next big game so we can watch Reddit buy it again then cry But once you do youll feel very proud and accomplished deleted When did it become not enough to make games people love and will pay for Because I think BF is a good game Its just ruined by a terrible progression system They removed the season pass system and then implemented something that is factually  times worse Why We cant let this happen Like I said I was hyped for BF because I love Dice games and Star Wars but this This is absurd I refuse to buy the game now  included  Did you buy the  version of the logo  Yesterday I made this and the mods deleted it Here ya gohttpsiimgurcomvuhxULgif EA Games charge for everything I wish this level of outrage would be put towards net neutrality because in a week they will be voting on it and no one is talking about it Shouldnt the community be complaining to Disney Yes EA has a multiyear licensing agreement but they are damaging Disneys brand Disney could pressure EA because at some time EA will want to renew their agreement This mess is on our shoulders not EAs They might pull this shit but they do it because we have been telling them for years that this kind of behavior is okay and we will still buy their games and effectively reward them for it Just stop Do not give EA your money Ever I dont care if a game looks fantastic Finish the  untouched games in your Steam library instead If you preordered Battlefront  you have no right to complain about EA You have already rewarded them for their shitty behavior You paid them to fuck you You should probably just sell your PC quit the hobby and go do something else because you are making it worse for everyone EAs dick Its in your ass I hope you feel that sweet sweet pride  and accomplishment  OP EA GAMES  CHARGING EVERYTHING I really like how big this whole fiasco seems to FINALLY be Like Ive seen shit about EA in several subs now and videos and comments and all that shit about EA that Ive not really seen in past years that much I would LOOOOVE just fucking people to totally boycott EA and not buy ANY of their shit but I THINK Ive now seen a much bigger response to the shit that EA pulls than years before Seriously this shit were seeing EA doing is almost practiced by every AAA company today we HAVE to make a fucking change we HAVE to stop it before it becomes the accepted norm I DO believe that we gamers as a community are a strong force but we still dont represent everyone Theres ALWAYS going to be the unknowing parents or kids that will buy the games but I REALLY think that now more than ever is really the time to crank it up and spread the news spread the information about the fucking gambling that these shitty companies rely on to STOP giving money to EA Glad to see so much shit towards EA but Im afraid its still not enough DO NOT buy these games even if you love Star Wars I know its hard if you do but PLEASE for the sake of the WHOLE INDUSTRY do NOT support this Dont forget the limit of earning  credits per day then the  hour countdown starts Credits may additionally be drops from purchasable lootboxes EA SPORTS Its in the game for just  You stole the Washington Red Skins slogan Not accurate Should be  for a chance at unlocking a part of the logo Duplicate parts of the logo can drop but you can break them down into pixels and use them to build part of the logo you dont have EA has become the next gambling giant and just like all their predecessors absolute denial of any wrong doing is the narrative being maintained We all know that gambling has existed for a long time and that people are adults and can make decisions based for themselves but this new medium of positive reinforced gambling is sick The will use the gamblers fallacy to lure players in with a false sense of success a few wins to start get the dopamine flowing and before you know it your player has spent hundreds of dollars on a product that gives them literally nothing The fact that EA has built a business model predicated on the genetic dispositions of people and then infused a faux rewards system has to be one of the most disgusting cash grab schemes Ive ever seen BF skinner talks about something called the VR schedule of reinforcement where players are induced to pay money to receive a return reinforcement value that is to small to exchange under exisiting schedules This kind of clandestine conditioning is being marketed at young kids who are manipulated by the promise of high reward for a low initial investment any reward no matter how small triggers a response In the brain this is operant behavioural conditioning They have probably paid psychologists and behavioural therapists millions of dollars to develop a system they will yield in the highest amount of small transactions Once the anticipation of reward has been developed in a persons behaviour you have a perpetual gambling addict spending real money on in game bullshit I for one am now never ever buying EA products again they have destroyed so many games and developer studios been the largest proprietor of micro transactions to date  I mean look at the sims and now after SWBF which was a disgustingly pathetic excuse for a game thy release not a video game but an interactive gambling platform where you have to pay to experience any of the actual Star Wars related content EA are putrid vomitous cretins and Im hoping for the day they go broke If you spend  theyll let you open a lootbox which may or may not contain the rest of the logo Maybe dont preorder next time so you wont have to fix their logos and be so personally offended when they do it the next time EA sucks Why is everyone criticising EA Ive only ever known EA as an excellent video game company and pioneer of the early home computer games industry EA has always had my enjoyment as their primary concern and their community involvement is phenomenal  has been deposited into your Paypal account remember to delete this part of the message before posting it Get the fuck out of my office Edit It was actually building South Park reference That episode and the Freemium Isnt Free episode summed up EA pretty well EDIT disregard Problem here is the lock should be  of the logo not  but still funny Can someone link me to their ama of today The fp microtransaction model shouldnt be apart of fullpriced games Its as simple as that EA The reason most mobile games get away with it is because it doesnt cost anything to download or play  to unlock microtransactions Cue EA winning Worst Company in America again This is false EA only lets the player play  of the game not  of it I think your numbers got mixed up EAt shit What is that font I think youre being kinda generous with the unlocked portion of the game Im almost mad at myself for buying the last battlefront and only playing it for a few weeks after realizing there was no point EA Sports Its in the DLC EA Games Ruin Everything A better slogan for EA is Bitch Wheres My Money All this hate isnt going to change shit Its all going to die down within the next few days and back to normal At the most it will last until the game awards where they show something amazing and then the money throwing will ensue EA Games Your Wallets in the game DAE EA IS BAD Play for  more hours for alternate color Hey dont be mean the new NfS game is okay I mean not that bad I mean I didnt waste my money  I refuse to believe Cant wait for the paid DLC though The main story has about  hours of gameplay for the  dollars I payed Only  locked Thats pretty generous RiP in Peace Respawn rekt The locked part should be bigger reminds me of the Washington Redskins Shouldnt it read GO FUCK YOURSELF   Requires GFY DLC Taketwo interactive is following this same model but nobody gives them shit for it Dank EA Challenge everything Oops More like Charge for everything NOW its fixed httpsiimgurcomScndepnghttpsiimgurcomScndepng Should be only  of the logo unlocked EA Man gamers are dumbfucks we keep treating them like shit they keep giving us billions of dollars every year TM I dont get it Whats the emblem supposed to be Just dont give EA your money no matter what Its really that simple Theres plenty of good games for all of us to enjoy without our money ending up on EAs hands Challenge Everything for an extra  I see you already purchased earned  of the DLC and only have  left to unlock Imagine your sense of accomplishment once you finally acquire the credits needed to unlock the rest That seems inaccurate Too much of the logo unlocked by default I miss the Nintendo era  Challenge Everything Including player trust every year  Pfft with the way EA works the locked portion should be the unlocked content and vice versa Dude you inverted grey and black on your logo Madden    Coins to unlock the Green Bay Packers Theyre currently holding an AMA and it is an embarrasment Its a PR team of some  people paid hundreds by the hour scuffling ASAP to mesmerize and salvage while taking extreme care and avoiding the most inconvinient questions and providing sterile empty answers  locked Thats generous No the Black would be the DLC amount thats too generous to EA EA Sports Its in the game But you gotta pay for it Their AMA right nowhttpsmediagiphycommediaQAyMhazfDIgiphygif  of the game is unlocked Thats rather generous for EA I reckon we should just Boycott EA until they stop making their games so Pay to win This is why you dont do drugs kids You make stupid business decisions like this Just feel awful for the actual developers The tagline is wrong its EA Pay Forever Its in the lootbox Edit actually its It used to be in the game Still dont think  covers enough  should do it about right Someone somewhere is looking up how to buy  credits right now Seems like it should be the other way around  locked Maybe a few years ago You are wrong the correct is  locked This is no meme or a joke Its absolutely true Fixed it some more hope its more accurate httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentsdhzpifixedeaslogosomemore Id like similar for tripleAs other big names EA is far from alone Credits come in packs of   for  off or  for  off Ill save this for years Electronic Arse I seem to be missing something here EA have been double triple quadruple dipping for years now game price  dlc price  unlock price  loot price Why the tsunami of hate all of a sudden This circle jerk is tiresome I think this the most real post of anything on anything I have EVER seen Fuck EA and their company structure as a father of three and a huge family we are boycotting EA games this season C I R C L E J E R K Ill save this for the AMA later seriously third day of this this shit just let it go if you dont like the game dont buy it Whoa guy that is too much content for me Can you lock at least another  of the content for me to buy back later Thanks Beautiful I wish some shitty Indy game developer makes a Star Trek game and everyone buys it no matter how bad it is just to fuck with EA  Oh EA What a disservice you have done Farewell sweet prince You will not be missed I already hated them for getting rid of Maxis Nice meme  well memed  Oh my   credits OR only another  FTFY EDIT   credits OR only another httpswwwpcgamesncomstarwarsbattlefrontiistarwarsbattlefrontmicrotransactionscost Idea Pay  to unlock microtransactions Please add disney as part of

Amazing Someone give this guy a medal Im actually feeling sorry for Dice Their game is amazing in many ways and I know that people arent opposing Dice directly but this will most likely backlash to

top posts You forgot to mention The entire logo is required to play the game But you get the full game when you buy it EA GAMES  Go Fuck yourself Or for only  we have  different prostitute DLCs for you to choose from But if I fuck my self will I feel a sense of accomplishment I dont get it Its too subtle remind me of thishttpsiimgurcomQZtZDNjpg uMightytearex can you update your image BattlefrontII costs  to buy the game and  to buy the rest of the game So how bout a logo where  is black and  is locked Thats probably not a fair comparison but neither is EA a fair company Eat shit EA you ruined Command and Conquer Tiberian series The asterisk screaming the punchline detracts from it a little in my opinion You need to grind for  hourss or pay  bucks too unlock the full logo  inb ironic and hilarious games appear on Steam about the EA meme for  bucks This is beautiful I read this glorious post as I was exiting the elevator at work Had to take a minute to gather my thoughts and take extra care to say to the other person in the elevator Have a good day instead of Go fuck yourself Unrelated but this reminds me of that CollegeHumor Apple parodyhttpsyoutubejyTAHQZLAtms Im glad this movement is still going strong and wasnt like a one day thing Fuck EA EA Games DLC in everything Now well part with that age ol EA saying get the fuck out of my building am i the only one who stressed in the GO FUCK YOURSELF part hhhhh Link to full video for the lazy httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvKTiNzXubLo Kyle really is like this in real life Super thoughtful guy who is a delight to be around Lyle wouldve jumped that kid  just sayin I dont know who Bitwit is but the kind of guy who would meet a fan in public and then turn around and do something like this made me subscribe removed This made me smile D Leaving work This is the sweetest thing Ive seen all day Commendable But that kid needs to learn the art of the hustle Well I WAS going to run  Tis in SLI but I only have  Kyles awesome That sonofabich Lyle would never have done that The  ti really is a great mid tier card if youre limited to p gaming like me and can get it for under  That kid is pretty lucky he ran into him Now this puts a smile on my face Not a huge fan of recording good deeds for views but then again it was really wholesome  EDIT nevermind it was actually part of the video not single clip In that case we may forgiveforget Kyles suicide attempthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvTivmhq for this great act of awesomeness P I love the reaction of the woman My goodness this is why we all love bitwit The best part is how he doesnt in any way advertise this in the thumbnail OR title of the video Just does it because he cares What a sweet guy  Holy shit i know him in real life But did he still get that price match I like how he said oh my god as soon as Kyle said so here is what were gonna do  IS UNDER  So very cool by Bitwit But  he will regret this as he gets mobbed by kids with shopping lists everytime he goes into a computer shop Wholesome Kyle Also shoutouts for not capitalizing on that act by putting in on the thumbnail or with a dumb title like KID AT BEST BUY GETS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE EMOTIONAL But I like my RX  The first video I saw of this guy was the review of the asus spatha From that video alone I knew this guy was great Thanks Kyle for being a damn hero Ive no idea who this person is but that is awesome When I was that kids age this would have made my year One of the best parts is that it wasnt even a part of the video title at all No clickbait just good deeds  Hes a real awesome sauce He shouldve been looking at the s He seems like a good kid Smart too He knows his budget and hes actively trying to get a better deal He is going to remember this for the rest of his life Its almost too wholesome for reddit In addition he didint use anything about this for his title No clickbait good guy Kyle i wish i had more disposable income to do things like this as time as gone on ive felt less obliged to step up for others even in small ways i did lots of charitable acts from teens though late s now in early s it just does not appeal to me in the same way maybe its just me maybe its a societal thing idk it usedto make me feel really good watching this video i feel happy the last time i offered charity i found i had been swindled out of a couple hundred i guess ive just felt more broken I really hate vlogs except for Bitwits I think him and his wife are actually really funny Kid should have asked for a Ti Nah but seriously this made me smile that kid was absolutely made up One day Ill pay it forward like this This is a sworn oath This is so wholesome it makes me happy Im legit saving up to get the  ti So Im glad he was able to get his I will get there soon Yo give this guy a damm medal I did the same thing when a kid wanted to buy a used controller in game stop because he didnt have enough for a new ps controller So I gifted him a new one He wouldnt stop jumping up and down in joy It made my day if not year I always remember when I did that I would challenge more ppl to do this Das good shit Lyle be like kaile yu cheapskate buy day kid de twente eighteh tee ai I can get for cheap because my cousin making them in factories I love how he didnt even try to milk it He didnt put it in the title or thumbnail or anything Shows how genuine and generous he is Ive lurked his channel for a while now Just subscribed Wow thats awesome Never heard of bitwit but job well done He went straight for the hug Thats wholesome af everyone liked that Got back into PC buildinggaming very recently Bits channel played a huge part in that Seems like such a genuinely good dude That kids mining rig just for a sweet upgrade What a good dude Pc guy for life right there bit wit did this to get laid from his wife and i dont blame him I would fucking cry and Im a grown ass man damn that got me I just saw this video and KNEW it would be on here somewhere Smart kid well spoken too Hope he enjoys the card I like how the kid didnt want something more expensive than that RX and his reaction was priceless That ti is the price of a  how did this blow up in this community xB EDIT this actually come from BitWit so i have my answer Saw that coming a mile away Still teared up Were all that kid inside He knows what that meant rmademesmile Thats so sweet  All the feels I had something stuck in my eye anyways That was cool I started laughing when he said Subscribe to BitWit Lyle Fack yu Kyle yu so selfish I will give him the Ti if I wer dear Wholesomeness deleted So WHOLESOME I would have joked that he should have said a  but hes probably only gonna need a ti and props to him for being humble Bitwit is such a nice guy What a fucking bro This warmed my heart up real nicely Props to bitwit this made me smile not much makes me smile Why are any of these guys in a best buy No thats actually just Lyle but Kyle was doing a voice over Nah just kidding Lyle would of mugged that kid I appreciate that he seems to go for the wife authorization before doing it and she gives him the nod Lol Mr beast would have bought the kid a house Umm I would probably go for dual s if I had the money I work as a senior techician and a younger kid and his friend came in to see if I could look at their laptop as they were trying to clean it He told me literally exactly what any technician wouldve done step by step but got stuck on the hinge as he was scared hed break it Told me the difference in all his laptop parts and etc when I asked him if hes ever built a desktop he said no because this laptop is the only pc in the house Saw a bit of myself in that kid he talked so effortlessly idk what Id even call it Gave him a personal zi and a w psu Really great

restored on the other hand Ryre would sell the kid an RX for  Damn I saw Kyle come into my friends ice cream shop a couple months back I shouldve talked to him Thought he probably wanted to just talk to friends and not be bothered by someone So tight Here I am sitting with gtx  mx and I qm running on idle with  degree celcius Dont forget to screw that GPU in with confidence future MLG pro Wonder if he has reddit If you are out there let us know The way this kids mouth moves makes me think hes about to offer me the assistant manager position at a shitty chain restaurant Puts a genuine smile on my face This is so sweet Man this video made me happy af Id probably do the same thing if I had YouTube money to blow That was a very cool thing to do Omg his face was just too cute Love this video  Bitwit helped me build my first ever PC What a great guy Made me tear up  the kid seemed really nice and genuine Respect to Kyle I was having a really bad day but this turned it around I dont know who these people are but they just made my day Should have gone for the  AMP edition I know nothing about what a bitwit it is or this sub I assume something to do with computers But this vid was there so I watched it and Id like to give a Grammy hug to both of these sweet boys I dont know who this is but thats awesome No idea who Bitwit is but thats wholesome af  I have never seen their videos before but I am now a fan Purely out of premise I had one of those super fucking hard days where you just have a ton of moving parts and tasks that you cannot fail urgent work stuff family needs had a roofing contractor damage my wifes car and dip out blah blah blah you all have lives too I had a rough day and have been emotionally drained with my newborn daughter and all her and my wifes needs Ive almost gotten to years twice today But watching this made me truly smile and for the first time since AM I found some happiness Thank you for the lift DAMN IT KYLE YOU DID IT AGAIN xB What an awesome human being and what an awesome and humble kid Proud to be a member of this community No positive comments about the Best Buy employee in the video Shes a good sport to be in the video and pretty fly She could be the new Target viral employee remember him I like that the kid was honest and didnt just say  ti Im wine drunk laughing to tears Kyle is a dope dude and Jasons sheer excitement at this is wholesome af This was awesome Thanks for posting O shit I have that kids shirt Lyle Approved this This brought a huge smile to my face gotta love it This is nice Good on you internet and good on you Bitwit Cool now this kid can go on rust and start calling everyone he kills the N Word Holy f best YouTube ever I dont know who that is nor do I know anything about PC building but anyone who would help out a fan like that is just a great person and I hope nothing but great things for him i thought i was keeping up with the latest cards pretty muchbut wtf is a ti lmfao So sweet and he seems like such a nice kid too Play that OSRS i love Kyle This made me so happy I needed this today Thank you This made me happy My Best Buy pretty much only has Pentium Chromebooks for  kid gets in the parking lot FUCK I should have said the  Oh yeah big brain time Kyle is that dude But AMD is better Absolute legend Qhat is bitwit the girl in the background made the moment That kid was genuinely grateful Heartwarming So nice to see an adult treating young people like a capable human being rather than a naive youthful idiot I saw him mocking the verge and have been a fan since The kid was humble for saying ti but should of said Im going to the moon with RTX ti Glad to see the younger generation interested in PC building Best part was how he didnt use it to sell the video You know why this is extra special Because this kid has actually the time to play games Its kinda of a meme that when you finally earn enough money to buy a good rig you dont have the time to play with it But it is more than true Thats why i recently gifted my  to my cousin Yes i could have made  off it but whats the point Her having the card makes much more sense because she has the time to use it Childhood is the only time in your life where you realy have the time Been subbed to Kyle since he was awesomesauce He always struck me as a real genuine dude Him and Paul are my favorite tech tubers As a rx owner i kind of feel attacked And the best part is he didnt even use it as clickbait it whatever shit other YouTubers would have put Met a fan and he got a GPU for FREE but he didnt do that which probably meant that hes genuine about his gift I didnt have sound but Im guessing he bought this kid the part he was after I know you are going to put it to good use kid  awwwww yeah  FPS porn now the kid got  left to buy a decent cpu wich should get him something decent for the next years im so glad there are still younger people interessted in pcs because they do not limit your creativity the way consoles to Is a ti really an upgrade over a  Another fact Id like to point out is that this was just part of the video  meaning there was no hint of it occurring in the thumbnailtitle hence click baiting the video this alone gives me mad respect for the guy Truly wholesome AMD God damnit Bitwit started of as a kid ended the video a man Subscribed for the PC Build videos Stayed for the man everything he does and Wifeysauces looks of disappointment He didnt use it for clickbaid it was a  or something and it was super random can we crown him for the best PC youtuber Not gonna lie This almost made me cry Kid knows he getting shit for free epic Kyre a stoopid Kyle you are breathtaking Class act i went to his streamhe was playing roblox with fps Wholesome ad On a train without earphones what happened in the video Why am I not subscribed to him PCMASTERRACE community  Nvidia hmm His guide helped me build my first pc Bitwit Why the fuck did he change the name Lyle will not be happy What a awesome dude Kyle is not many people like this in the world really hard to find Keep it up Kyle this is so wholesome I love his upgrade and gift vlogs Hes just a guy who loves the space Also Im not crying Im sweating through my eyes Its wholesome but the most wholesome Cmon man Kyul think he soooooo keewl giving GPU to kids Little did he know I giv away whooole PC just a few weekago Pff Ryle Lyle Idc what content Bitwit makes Im subscribing right now This wasnt staged the kid wasnt bribed and everyone was just being incredible This is the kind of stuff I want to see  Kyle didnt used that moment on his title for clickbait  Everyone liked that  We need a Lyle commentary of this video I saw this and I was impressed that he didnt put it in the titel or made a big deal of it you can tell it was pure kindnes and view grabbing just a little bit Awww this was so sweet Kyle Bless  Tell the kid to put his savings toward a good monitor I built my first PC a few months ago using the guide from his channel Super helpful dude Oh God thanks Btw I need a Mobo CPU PSU g DDR to make it all work Cool of him to do but I still know a ton of people who dont support him because of some of his more controversial videos Not sure why he insists on continuing to make those The YouTuber is actually genuine he didnt even click bait or put the fact that he did this random act of kindness in the title That bestbuy employee was like I know what is going to happen Lol Thats a good grounded humble kid If I was there I wouldve gone straight for the ti Im already subbed to Kyle seems like an overall great person Who is good with PCs Dont hate but I have a pre built and I wish I had someone like him to guide me on the stuff I am nervous and what I dont know about I would Need help water cooling never done it before and you can forget headers and cpu his face lit up at  heres whats gonna happen I just saw this the other day super cool He even plugged the channel what a legend My ti shed a tear Watched the video earlier and I just knew it was coming the whole time and couldnt stop smiling Kyle Lyle is the man The shocked USB face cannot be unseen Careful who you call fat in the s

This would have been better with the actual photos  This is nitpicking but theres no way the usb couldve opened more Its little tab was already up all the way Unless it was flipped idk He should have used the k floppy disk instead of the k floppy diskwould have made it more dramatic oh Goes trending in  Fun fact if one had  tb worth of  inch floppy disks in the same proportions as a single floppy

sometimes You posted this  times to diffrent subs You also got K karma from this pls teach me Dont diskrespect him or else Is it alright to point out one missed detail that slightly bugged me The

laugh D I survived bitch Surprised gigachu I hate land whales who complain about being opressed o Repost Double the posts double the karma Ironically the floppy disk and tb micro have about the same read speed Universal service bully It should say floppy instead of fatty Perfect What if he was formatted in NTFS Then the micro sd sees the cloud If hes lifting weights then hes going to gain even more weight in muscle Im really unnecessarily bothered by the orientation of the floppy disk if the artist flipped it upside down the cutout section would be in the same position as well as the darkcoloured strip they both have on one end Fake Floppy is missing the totallyunbreakable copy protection tab I remember when GB jump drives were about  So much emotion carried in that last facial

K Was FAT now NTFS I used to be FAT until I went to the gym and got reformatted Not disc disk XD The USB knows what to do Heres where it gets weird Why did the floppy turn into flash media when the USB is flash I know Im taking this way too far but shouldnt the floppy turn into a TB HDD Then the usb can turn into nvme through hard work Lol LmAo NANI Thicc This is so cute Actually USB drives are more similar to SD drives than SD drives are to floppys if only lol Upvoted for creativity I see a pikachu face Love it flashwow Sd Cards are flash memory and Floppys are magnetic tape If anything the comic juxtaposed the Floppy and the USB Boooooo Damn fin ripped wtf usb speaking shit but he aint Mini usb oof LOL How do you get a custom flair Its funny because the flash drive is formatted in FAT this is funny From  to  mb Theres always a bigger fish Okay this is brilliant and hilarious This might be my favorite comic strip of all time removed Professionnel Wait how do you get professionel for  Its  over here If I could find a legit proper MS key for win pro in Italy for  or  for what it matters i would buy it instantly Sadly the prices on the MS store are outrageous like this HttpswwwmicrosoftcomititpwindowsproDFXDRKTDVicidCatWindowsmosaiclinknavWindowsProititactivetabpivotaoverviewtab  incl taxes for a w pro key Wtf MS wtf ACTIVATE WINDOWS GO TO SETTINGS TO ACTIVATE WINDOWS Its mostly because the industry has devalued operating systems You buy an Android phone or an iPhone OS is included You buy a Mac OS is free If you love Linux most distros are free To the average user the operating system seems to almost be a part of the hardware No wonder people balk when they find out they have to throw another  at a company just so their computer will run when all other pieces of hardware come with the OS included hell prebuilt PCs have Windows included Edit I realize that its baked into the cost of most devices including prebuilt Windows PCs Just saying that for the average user and especially those new to system building paying for it separately is a new experience removed Linux has entered the chat Linux has left the chat activate windows gang removed Honestly the thought of paying for windows  hurts when im still saving for the parts for a new computer This drives me INSANE People with a ti but bitch about the ACTUAL software that makes their whole PC useful AIGHT IMA HEAD OUT because you can pirate softwares not hardware This thread is drastically overstating how bad Windows  is Its been largely flawless for me Ive never had an update break my computer never had issues running games never felt like it slows me down or holds my hardware back Theres some features I chose to turn off to improve it but otherwise it works out of the box And yeah I get that you can go the Linux route fine do that but people are making strawman arguments to prop up this unfounded idea that Windows  is like Windows ME or something Its incredibly stable and very easy to use for every application I need Think the disgust is for Windows not for the  cracks knuckles ctrlf linux if windows didnt use you as the product and be such a steaming pile of spyware id gladly shell out the  for it Windows lost the right to cost money when it bundled Candy Crush Why would i pay  bucks for an operating system that automatically installs candy crush on my computer Laughs in Linux Laughs in GNULinux Well have discussions for each component along the lines of for only  more I could have even more performance Yet when it comes to the system to make it all run people resort to Ebenezer Scrooge levels of frugality I emulated the OS required by my multithousand dollar game collection for free and all I had to sacrifice was a small amount of performance compatibility with certain games varying driver support and various other general technical issues that the community vocally assures me are my fault and that Ive since learned to live with removed rlinuxmasterrace I cant torrent a cooling system Only Some hardware can be expensive but if you plan it right its worth it paying  for a crappy imo but usable OS seems a little overkill if youre not making a lot of money This is why I use Linux imagine paying  for trash If Microsoft made an operating system worth paying  for sure Id buy it However it needs to not spy on me and demand updates every other day like a petulant child  with support worse than free Download the one on the website and install like normal then click I dont own a windows activation key That will give you free windows lol I didnt even want it for free and your trying to make me pay for it You are damm right its too expensive who the fack buys candy crush for  mstoolkit with that much money im sure it has more ram than what regular windows  supports I download spyware free of charge all of the time What makes MSoft special I bough  computer and torrented windows  and got a free legit upgrade to Windows  when they had that promotion going on Works  perfectly to this day god what the fuck happened to this sub Do you even Linux bro Get an OEM key thats cheap as fuck or take advantage of the free windows  upgrade license by just using that hwid tool Because Im not paying for something that will data mine me regardless if I pay or not Yer I paid for Windows  pro but if I was too again I would just get one of them codes of the cd key websites i dont really care where they get it from so long as it works Its not that I dont wanna pay its the fact I dont like microsoft so I dont give them money I didnt buy it because windows  is a moldy piece of shit that deserves to rot in a pit of toxic spikes But i do need it for my ryzen   I dont like it but i have to Not many people spend that amount on a PC looking around the mainstream CPU used atm is the R   with something like a RX  laughs in TempleOS I mean yeah I wouldnt pay a  bucks for Windows  either if windows were well done it might be worth it The difference is I dont have to replace my RAM every time my hard drive breaks or I replace my motherboard or cpu It might as well be a subscription fee with how often Microsoft decides my computer is no longer the same machine because I swapped one part Replace the windows software with a picture of any game on steam that costs  and that would also be accurate Change my view Since Microsoft essentially gave windows  u po grades for free the os is full of annoying ads apps and privacy settings you have to manually turn off and they sometimes come back with updates Microsoft should be charging a LOT less for windows  than the same  they did for windows  and such It would also curb piracy or grey market sales if it sold for   is a ripoff for windows Its a huge buggy mess This is because Microsoft Windows is an established monopoly They couldnt get away with charging  in a market with literally any competition The shit M has done in the past all led to this DirectX Internet Explorer M Office Thats half the reason i dont use windows Linus is free and faster also plays most games Theres still one or two that dont work that i wish did but other than that works fantastically And honestly if youre gonna build a new computer why not give it a try Best case you love it and never pay for an os again worst case you dont and you buy a copy of windows no harm done I recommend PopOS or manjaro for new comers cant really go wrong either way Option  Use a Linux based OS like Debian as it is way better than Windows and free Option  go to the official download page at httpswwwmicrosoftcomenussoftwaredownloadwindowsISO on a nonwindows device say a phone or an iPad and download it Install and dont activate Id be a lot cooler with it if there wasnt bloatware constant ads forced restarts and resets and other annoying shit Probably because windows is hot garbage and all the other OSs are free Linux users Im sorry is this some kind of windows joke that Im too smart to understand Laughs in pirate yarr Windows  me laddie Linux is free Ew windows we use Linux where I come from Ahem use linux Windows  is fucking clown shoes Fuck Windows  and Microsoft Fuck them up their stupid asses i wouldve paid double for win i dont like having to pay for an os i dont like Nobody enjoys Windows enough to want to buy it Even if you need it for your games and your game hacking programs or whatever as a gamer there is no reason to like Windows compared to a console where you just put a game in update and play Windows is kind of a pain in the ass I feel like Microsoft should be paying me to use Windows sometimes Just use linux Because windows  is trash If I could game on Linux I would but most games arent supported on it One is a great pc build while the other is a bloated piece of shit spyware OS Windows  is overpriced I thought that them collecting my information was enough I need to roll back to Windows  Paying  for windows  is just a bad idea Go on eBay and pay  Windows install even gives them free if you follow the right steps Yeah cause we all know how the components work and how far we can push them best ways to implement them and how good they look Windows just updates itself and deletes your files when you dont want it to Powerful and expensive machine Dope Expensive adware OS No thanks Well you see I dont need Windows I need Direct X inside the Windows rlinuxmasterrace Well an RGB cooling loop doesnt come with bloatware ads for app games or voice recording spyware In th US we put the  before the amount What is with the recent last few years influx of people putting the dollar sign after the amount I dont think I ever saw anyone do that even by mistake before I started using Reddit a lot I mean Ive used the same windows  key like  times now and it still works HOW much did you guess Five hundred A thousand EVEN MORE Linux ftw ahem rlinuxmasterrace Linux  Windows  bros unite I still use the Windows  key that came with my parents shitty old dell from  years ago Wait people pay for Windows  Why cant we just switch to linux smh Linux is an option Penguins are free Why are people who arent building PCs for the first time buying copies of windows Your copy will followa major upgrade our full rebuild if you keep the same installation W dont care if you replace the Mobo W will also recognize your hardware profile if your drive dies And if not you can always call MS and tell them your rig is dead so its all new and they should reassign that key Linux is free though better deal than bluescreens for   Linux bro No one wanna buy that shit Youre paying for Windows Linux Well windows  is shit why would anyone want to pay for it lol Technically true but  dollars for a piece of cheap plastic is still a ripoff prove me wrong Yeah Ill be running  until that is unsupportedthen I am pure linux I just want to be able to go back to windows  which is windows  without all the bullshit but t this point its impossible from a gaming perspective Hell I would go back to xp if it was still viable Both were better than windows  Imagine not having to use windows and pay for a licence key  With proton and lutris being able to run windows games on Linux at similar performance to windows the  for a licence key meaning you can put more money towards a better CPU or GPU this could make a difference especially for budget builds Ubuntu is free Much less accurate when you struggle to pay  for a PC Honestly I still Miss windows  Dont get me wrong  did some nice stuff and its slowly been getting better but I still hate the condescending error messages and way microsoft repeatedly forces their beliefs of what your PC should do on you Besides Microsoft doesnt care about you pirating their OS The money isnt in OS sales anymore They gave away Windows  because the money is coming from selling info to advertisers I think most of us spent around  on a rig so a copy of Windows is more than  of the purchase which is justifiably irritating Get Linux for free Windows equaluvent will be kde neon rlinuxmasterrace Imagine paying for windows  unironically linux Activate windows watermark gang wya Windows should be free Theyre already profiting off your data You cant pirate a graphics card Its the fking bloatware that makes me cringe Why Microsoft why Id just pirate windows oh wait I did Still accurate though Dude when your budget is like  its a little different I got a key off eBay for like  Its worked perfectly ever since Even better by the cheapest damn win  pc you can find and clone the drive Pro tip you can buy windows  pro on eBay for  For me windows is like linked to my account so whenever I sign in it activates I thought it was just because it was on one computer but I built a new one and signed in it activated and the old one is too lol Idk why but Im not questioning Currently  bucks right now on amazon go check it out I will say my water cooling doesnt come with a bunch of bloatware that they get paid for to put in and doesnt also track all of my data and sell it off Just saying But lets be honest You dont want to pay th of your money on Windows  Linux time Why would I pay for Windows That shit is free lol ACTIVATE WINDOWS Go to settings to activate Windows I would take windows  over  any day also works with nba There are two kind of people on the world those who have never played it and those who play Fifa religiously They have one thing thing in common they hate Fifa They changed the number on the cover again Every sports game really Never really played FIFA but this can be applied to Madden as well I only play it for career mode as me and my friend always dicuss is that fifa and related titles are not for gamers its rather for football fans the football fan talks football plays the physical sport watches all the games follows up all the stats dreams football has all the the football things and FIFA is just another avenue to continue the hobbylikeinterest Course some people like the one game genre but thats a whole other thing what movie or film is this Recently Ive been working alongside a lot of Russians and Bulgarians and every one of them has individually asked me Bro you got a PS I used to have PS to play FIFA Bro you play FIFA Its great game bro Poor EA has to make money somehow httpsmediagiphycommediaEQmVHkveNckgiphygif Where tf is skate  for pc already As someone who has bought the last  or so FIFA is isnt the same every year It is essentially still  blokes chasing a bag of wind around a field but the gameplay has changed quite a lot over those  years Only problem is it probably peaked about  years ago and has descended along with basically everything EA makes into a trashfire Relevant MemehttpsiimgurcomhOJTyajpg And Pokemon Why dont they just release the game once and update it every now and then Imagine paying  for every Minecraft update If you dont play FUT and would prefer better gameplay I suggest giving PES a try with a community patch The gameplay is not for everyone but as someone who plays PES since ISS FIFA feels like an arcade ping pong game I only play Master League Career and its supposed to be reworked and improved in the next one Its a very chill game to play while listening to music Forget about fps believers This is what we have to worry about Ah yes Pay To Win in its ultimate form Rub it just right for an explosive surprise E A S P O R T S its in the game This year even more shittier due to missing Club licenses eg Juventus FC and Bayern Munich FV Yall really pay  every year for a number Ayy bruh we changed the cover and updated the player roster Now give us  for a new game so all your players that you won in last years game are worthless  Every Sports Game Let people enjoy games thanks Pokemon fans Problem is not that the most fun and most played game mode is one thats fueled by live content so if you wanna play you have to buy This includes all sports games and most yearly game releases Ive actually jumped off this ship I stopped at fifa  Im just playing  and I will NOT purchase another fifa game Basically any sports game ever same shit more micro transactions Rocket League a better game cheaper you only pay once and get free updates Fuck EA This year I am willing to give fifa fans a pass as they are introducing street mode thing Also cod HEY Relic made some good games dont you dare go disgracing the mine with that EA bullshit NHL fans lol I play fifa because I am literally obsessed with soccer I only play against friends or career mode Fuck ultimate team Thats every sports game I find that the people making these posts and the people playing the games arent the same people Let people like a game lol I mean if they love the games and it brings them happiness then its worth the money and we should leave them alone People in the comments are talking about sports games but is there really a difference between modern war fare  and  and most other series that come out with a new game every week Lookin at you assassins creed Literally any sports game Nice Thought this was going to be about Bethesda Oh Cute you should post it to raww Ive played NBA K for years Granted they could release one every  years and update the teams instead of releasing one each year but Its not shitty if you like the game Yes but with pokemon Is there a better sports game than fifa Fifa is honestly very well made as a game The engine is supreme and it feels so fluid to move the ball around the pitch When you score your first goal its like crack and you will keep playing Its not just the same shitty game every year Every year EA makes sure to make it even shittier and even more financially exploitative Could be interchanged with any sports game COD the side scrolling Mario games aside from Mario maker and tons of other games that people buy every year He likes something we dont like get him So true And Im still gonna buy it HAHAHAHAHHA DAE SPORTS GAM BAD Of course fat gamer slobs are going to hate on anything sports related Honestly dont understand the hype for sports games Whats more annoying are the youtubers who play these games just for the loot boxes COD would like a word Art by Nikita Veprikov httpsartstncopGBLGz So whens the release Pokemon And they bark in ur face when u slam their shitty rigged money grapping game And around that time people will trade in last years and complain when I have to give them  for it Rinse and repeat I stopped buying the game  years ago i think this would get more upvotes if it was the picture by itself Also works with pokemon rdankmemes repost nice every ubisoft game ever Wheres this from Looks like a Disney movie When it was always the same it was still not as bad as being almost the same but with lootboxes now Far Cry franchise So fucking true Youre right NFS is a better example the brand is just a label changing the label doesnt shouldnt change the experience Technically Half Life  is also the same game every year Haha love fifa To my shame I fell for it from  until  I have now been clean for  years    true I feel personally attacked but I also agree Dont you mean COD fans You mean any and electronic Arts games I avoid them like the plague because like Sony they are bad for the gaming world  Agree sir The only thing they change are the posters Call of duty Anyone else think this is a poor use of the format I feel attacked Fax boom I bought Fifa  on Ps yesterday for  Thats a solid oof captain well played And I hate myself for it Its not about the quality of the game as much as it is a game simulating peoples favourite sports and they have a monopoly so of course they do the shit they do if someone else wants to make a basketball game that simulates basketball and they do it better Ill switch first chance Its really about the fact that its a competitive online game You dont really have other options if youre into it Its not love its a captive audience Yeah sure httpsiimgurcomfHVGNpnghttpsiimgurcomfHVGNpng Works with marvel movies Just change it to every  months I promise they added so many features this year This applies to all the shitty sports games Never understood why people play that garbage We want SKATE  also works with POF xD The game isnt shitty the issue is that they make a new one each year I buy fifa every  years and enjoy it Its not like that at all They despise the game but cant quit like an addiction Also  of the players are little kids who dont know any better Omg its so much better than the last game Its so different rpufferfishbomb I havent ever bought a soccer game Based on this thread I never will Imagine buying a Xbox too just to play FIFA And marvel no but iTs dIffErEnT tHiS yEaR even call of duty isnt as bad and those are the same rehearsed games every time But can we just talk bout how cute the pic is PLayed every Fifa for like  years Then a few years back I tried PES Its a  times better Gameplay experience compared to Fifa Sadly it lacks in other areas As someone that bought a FIFA game for the first time since playing winning on my PS Im probably not gonna buy the next one I got FIFA  and its fun no way Im denying that I just dont see the point of buying basically the same game with a different title slapped on it Its not the same they change the logo Sometimes Ok its the same Could be said for basically all of the EA Sports games Youre also implying that FIFA games are the bombdiggity Repost REPOST ALERT The bets one for me was  they just improved graphics a bit and added better physics Its so annoying because I love football and just want a good football game to play  And Call of duty too Ya but this year theyre giving us a feature Fifa Street they removed  years ago so its basically a brand new game Us Football Manager fans cannot take the piss here or Call of Duty fans any yearly game really Only took  seasons but i learned my lesson I enjoy playing FIFA I upvoted this knowing full well I am gonna buy FIFA  Why is FIFA so bad I swear After seeing the patents for the dynamic difficulty adjustments or whatever they called it I can honestly say Fifa  will be the first one I wont be buying The game feels unfair and on the whole poor but above all its a platform for EA to squeeze as much money out of their players Every game feels different and unfair and EA alter the stats and performance of players in an attempt to make every game feel close Just close enough to make the player feel like theyre one more upgrade away from winning Its all a ploy to make you spend money on packs The only way to beat FIFA is to not put any money into it Replace FIFA with EA and you have a better meme Also Ive never seen this format before whats it calledwhere did it come from Precisely why I stopped buying EAs sports games I am still playing NCAA football  on my PS One of the best EA sports games IMO rproevomasterrace Expecially lets waste a thousand dollars or more in a card game that last  year Applies to NHL Not true I buy it every other year You mean any sports game right Oh and those CoDWhatevers are mostly the same too why are you crying My son is at the age where he should be watching porn but instead hes playing with metal Lego Edit TIL the existence of erector setsMeccano thanks my Reddit brethren Planet Minecraft Do people not just use incognito

wwwtubegalorecom Pcpartpicker been there saving me from this for two years and I have yet to build a pc I think there iswas a plugin for firefox to not record the history of certain domains so you dont have to go incognito and the site would not show up in the history or suggested urls unless you bookmark it Id assume Even the extension didnt store the domain cleartext iirc Dank You fools Use Incognito Make it a habit and save yourself the stress Come on people Its  This is nothing back I used to use Youporn a lot because they allowed download without sign up and its much more risky game

uBarklehh Who actually uses their PC for it though lol PlanetMinecraft paypal my guy Just two cents from a random internet stranger I use to go to a lan Cafe and I stopped going because it was more expensive then buying all my own stuff The lan Cafe didnt have any deals or memberships to pay in advance for a yearly membership or something I wish it did because paying money everytime to play didnt feel right  If I paid for it up front and forgot about it I could just enjoy the time and experience  Also an adults only time would have been appreciated too for example after ten or something when the  should be home anyways  Dont choose favorites the lan Cafe I went to only had LoL installed and didnt have DoTA  or HotS  Also some TVs on with twitch streamers or some gaming broadcasting is a good way to fill the silence in the background but as long as its not too loud so that the game sounds are not affecting communication  Lastly red bull mountain dew all that sugary stuff is fine sometimes but please at least have some water  tea  normal drinks They dont have to be free of course but at least have them I only throw these things out because I want your place to be successful Hope the best to you Edit Thats a weird one to get gold for but I suppose it speaks to how much gamers want LANs to succeed Thanks stranger My nips can cut diamonds right now So this is  PCs worth of parts for my LAN Center Im opening On top of this we still have  more PCs with the higher end parts coming in Its literally a dream come true standing in this room with all these parts Edit So since this is the most visible post I will put this here Wow I did not realise you guys would have had THIS MUCH of an interest in our LAN Center There have been waaaaay more questions than I can answer one at a time so Ill post all the top ones here with the answers were opening in Sugar Land TX ARush Gaming is our name We will have  PCs  Racing Cockpits  VR stations and  console couch areas as well as a small lounge with tables and chairs to just hang out in Here is a picture of a d model of the designhttpsibbcozPcZQy Our date for our soft opening is Aug th were doing a Classic WoW Launch event lock in for it Why intel over AMD  Bulk Pricing and availability at the time were our real deciding factors How much did that cost   Whats the full build list  httpspcpartpickercomlistqjqmyX for the parts in the picture httpspcpartpickercomlistBVbKCb for our enthusiast builds We will serve snack style foods like instant ramens and chipsdrinks but wont have a liquor license or food license at launch We totally understand that the LAN Center business is volatile and that many have failed before we believe the time is right for one in the area we chose though and are taking a chance while we have it Thank you all so much for all the comments and support this REALLY blew up and we just got a whole nother wave of energy to keep going which we will need for the upcoming buildathon Every lan center that has opened near me closed down within a year Good luck OP Damn Lan centers are still profitable Lucky you Shit died out here in NYC I had most fun in lan centers Bruh how much does all those boxes cost OP you should talk with some High Schools in the area if any have an eSport team as somewhere they can go to practice Heck just promotion in the HS would get a lot of traffic oh thats hot I have never actually seen a LAN center Just curious how it works Is this something where group of people rent the space for a certain period of time to have LAN parties or do individual people come in to play other random people Or even e sports teams coming in to practice RemindMe  Year Check MooseAntlers posts for a deal on a gently used PCs Thats an interesting cover story to justify your spending on PC Stupid question time Who does a LAN center cater to Mind telling us a little about your business plan So here is the build for the parts you are seeing here with a little big of wiggle room for manufacturers since finding  of each part is kind of hard I sincerely apologize for any PC part shortages we may have caused httpspcpartpickercomlistqjqmyX We are also waiting for  of our enthusiast tier build to come in which I am even more hype for that uses this build httpspcpartpickercomlistBVbKCb What is the ROI on a build like this or the enthusiast build you posted below I worked in a LAN centre when I was a student Singlehandedly the best and worst job I ever had Pros Endless getting paid to play games  organise tournaments Nerdy conversations Free snacks Cons Screaming children playing COD Old guys watching porn Cleaning  keyboards twice a day Free snacks No offense man but LAN centers are a dead business for a reason only tourists in foreign countries use them why will people spend money to use a PC at a LAN center when their home computers are perfectly fine My pp hard Having an area for table top gaming DnD and the like would be a great way to bring in more people lol have fun going bankrupt in  years Know this comment might get buried but just a quick word after seeing several of these fall under do NOT cut corners with licensing Lawsuits from publishersdevs can tank these businesses quickly sadly enough Just make sure before you deploy anything youre making money off of that the license youre using complies ie Windows licensing use of SteamUplayOrigin etc Often just takes a quick call or email to make sure youre following agreements and its definitely for the better Id LOVE to see these take off in the states again this is awesome When you go out of business in  months can I have your stuff With how expensive electricity is in TX how are you going to be profitable AC   pcs running at the same time You are also by Houston Which turns into waterworld once a year Will you be putting floates on each pc I think I speak for everybody when I say HHNNNNNNNGGGG PCMR Pro Tip Keep an eye on OPs posts in the coming months Youre bound to get a reasonable deal on a gently used gaming PC when hes selling inventory after declaring bankruptcy Business strategy question Did you bootstrap or raise funds  partnerships  Been thinking of doing a build center but cant bootstrap  Dude  thanks for the PC bonner Reading your others comments it seems that you have most of the bussiness aspect covered my question is how much time did u spend with this idea on your mind how much have you planned in advance  Shouldve gone with AMD couldve saved some money Ive always been curious how the PCs are configured to prevent malicious activity They cant be VMs because youd get worse performance right Is it just a very restricted AD user account I havent been to a LAN center in probably  years so I bet there are plenty of good solutions just curious how they work EDIT I see in another comment OP states theyre using GGLeap Ill have to check it out I wanna go but Im stuck with Linus Wish I had a lan centre near me Its not much but its mine Looks like a weeks worth of my wifes amazon purchases I hope at least one of those boxes is full of Fabreze otherwise your LAN Center will never be rid of that PRO GAMER SMELL That is too much power for one person Judging from your comment history I hope you dont blame your impending business failure on immigrants Good luck Ive been working on a solo project the past  years to open a LAN center downtown as an afterschool center for youths Any suggestions would be appreciated Also good haul there very excited to see the finished setups Theres a place called Cave Gaming Center in Burke VA My friends opened that place and I mightve been part owner too had I chipped in when they started I suggest you look at their model Most Lan centers cant survive in the US unless you have a high Asian population nearby or you have a reasonable price range Although I didnt agree with my friends pricing structure I did suggested them about setting up streaming booths and weekly fighting game community tournaments As far as I know theyve had some success initially getting Blizzard to host regionals for Hearthstone there I dont know how well theyre doing now but they also have bunch of Music Arcade Machines that a middleman put in their place too The place gets packed when they have tournies And they usually have  tournies in a week  of those being SmashI think Gl going bankrupt Looks like a whole lot of fun is about to happen And then at the end of it you can play games on them No AMD  How about mining centre honest question hopefully I dont get flamed What made you go nvidia over amd So where are the crates of Bawls I would make it so kids could have birthday parties there They can bring in their own food and drink Of course this would all be in a separate room from the PCs Especially in Sugarland I think you guys could turn a profit This guy is a legend Please keep us updated on the center Also please keep rMMA updated too on your career Love to see you go places dude merge them all together make the ultimate pc Completely out of curiosity why didnt you go with Ryzen They have similar gaming performance for a far lower price Do you plan on keeping all of these boxes If so make sure to put a number on the boxes that correspond to each PC Eg if PC  has a GPU failure then you just have to look for a GPU box with  on it to smooth the RMA process Dont forget the server with active directory domain Please dont do a  computer work group Please dont Proper group policies Everything Oh and enterprise routers like something from Cisco or SonicWALL You should put  classic style arcade machine in your place like with a joystick and the circle buttons Those really set a fun gaming vibeatmosphere The problem with those is that you take up a lot of space with a heavy ass machine for only  out of date game that ppl only play for noveltys sake But if you can put in it an emulator so ppl can play thousands of games across NESSNESSEGAPSNetc then youll not only have the vibe part covered but youll have a really fun af machine too You can charge for it or let ppl use it for free Dude you gonna need a lot of help building and troubleshooting these Tell me you have a team I owned an opperated a gaming center for nearly  years The biggest issues you will have are broken hardware from general use Keyboards mice headsets and chairs Malware getting onto pcs requiring you to reimage systems every nightyou can automate this Steam licensing is total bs for gaming centers they will ban people that use personal accounts in a gamingcenter read the find print Some people are just slobs Be sure you setup a licensing system the adds and removes the license to and from each computer when a game is lauched allowing you to buy less games but still allows your customers to play their favorite game from any PC Not possible with Steam or blizzard games Some things to note from your photo Intel is are just not going to cut it for paid gaming In order to make real money in this business you need to have top end hardware something people dont have at home I would have went with AMD x We had horrible luck with nvidia cards failing so make sure you have extra hardware on hand to replace on the fly We did contests and gave away the systems in the gaming center as prizes when we replaced units All night events are great profit Day passes are great peofit for Mondaythursday Prepay for FriSatSun Get a food license and sell food for much better revenues We had  PC seats plus console seats and pulled about  income In the end i closed up because my other businesses were doing a lot better and this ate A LOT more of my time Finding reliable people to run it was next to impossible Good luck As an Amazon worker I hate you Some tips from someone that grew up in gaming cafes Have some vending machines with a plethora of energy drinks coffee water and snacks Have lots of packages especially night packages if youre going to be a  lan cafe if a day lan is  for hours make a night lan for hours Restrict loud people to some level Raging once in a while is okey but you should make sure people dont start flipping inside your IC Host tournaments every once in a while people love them A ladder system for the  most popular games in your area is a good idea The more wins someone gets while playing in your netcafe the more points he gets and after a certain amount of points he can exchange them for free hours or something Socialise with your customers give them tips while they are playing gift them an hour or two if they come often Gamers are often lonely and if you manage to make friends with them they will prefer your IC over others Have lots of games available Not every game has to be installed There are some clients than install the top  most popular games and all the others are available for download Assuming you have Google fiber this is great for people that visit internet cafes to play newly released games I assume customers have to sign up to be able to buy LAN packs and not pay per hour If so each user should have some local storage gb or so thats bound to his account This allows people that play games with modsskinsetc Skyrim osu Gta V to be able to download them and save them to their accounts storage and not have to redownload every time the PC restarts Ill add more later Man thatd be EXTREMELY profitable back in the Philippines Open up one in Manila Capital and undercut the competition by a cent or two Theyre overpriced anyways and youre flooded with people Looks cool but is Why Some of the engineers here at NVIDIA just did a backflip from excitement in the middle of a meeting Dude you are literally doing what I would be if I had the capital to launch something like this Please keep us or just me updated Thats so cool Its beautiful OP am I seeing heaven Oh so this is why my Mobo was delayed Gl man Best of luck Just the fact that youre opening a LAN center itself is appreciated Give the best of luck and hope you succeed  had lots of fond memories myself OP Do you have custom rooms for playing I can imagine a gamer renting a PC to record and livestream for their own twitchyoutube channel Too  to buy the equipment just rent one instead I dont want to ask But how much did all that cost What networking equipment will you use Thank you good sir for doing Gods work here Ill take the parts that you dont use xD Lol people still do lan centers Cant imagine that making any money but good luck I hope you guys have a place to hang out and watch twitch streams of big tournaments and just casual watching Theres nothing more satisfying than going out and watching regular sports side by side with esports How did that all fit under the floor mat in front of the door So hard right now

overall only when a post reaches the top  of rall But think of all the things that  PC can do That game can only do one thing The problem is the PC you can use on a daily basis for another  years Majority of games you can finish in a week or less and never touch it again I dont have a problem with spending  on a game I know is good Which is rare When you buy a PC you know what youre getting When you buy a game youre taking a risk that the game is garbage or isnt fun to you especially in this day and age I dont buy games very often for this reason Literally just about to build a PC for  and even during the summer sale I was hesitating getting some games To be fair a lot of current games are just shit Even AAA games have shit PC ports Im with you man Most games are just not worth it anymore its like a new gaming depression k Pleb Thats how much i spend on my RGB fan Now excuse me I gotta decide how to distribute  cents amongst the charities on the humble bundle site Kinda true Spent  on my rig yet I was there pondering whether or not to get a game for  for a few months I wasnt even light on cash But I think the  games I have on steam were a factor since I dont wanna add anything before I finish the games I wanna finish first If youre not stingy when buying your games you will end up paying way more than  on games in the next couple of years Well I know that Ill love building the computer and using the computer Plus its physical Games are more of a gamble Also in my case a lot of my computer came from puppy dogeyeing my family lol You wouldnt download a GPU Especially when its a Crafting sURvival early acceSs opEn world Game Curse Hey man a PC is going to give you potentially years of entertainment Itll store your photos videos music word documents powerpoints etc You can browse the Internet with it You can play games on it You can use it to communicate with friends and strangers from all over the world You can create things with it You can use it for work play and leisure A game as fun as it may be if you manage to buy one that actually turns out to be good can give you potentially years of entertainment too but its still just one thing for you to do Greece yay steam sales The games are so cheap Buy all the games Bank uuuh bro Steam wallet bn Greece shit I get this But Im way cheaper like  is too much a lot of the time But I dont mind spending  on knives Just did that this morning  Vs me where I have  in my steam account and I still cant figure out what to use it for even during big sales I have nearly  pc games and yet I spend so much of my time on a very select few Id say Ive only even touched a handful of my pc games The games I have the most hours in are Rust Garrys Mod and Overwatch Between those  games is about  hours of gameplay My steam library is worth more than my computer Nice Except that it took me  generations of systems to come close to spending  on hardware deleted Spent k on keyboards and k on the PC k on audio and k on table and chair Still dont want to buy most games above  Ive literally never spent more than  bucks on a single game Even back in the early console days I always had a system  generations behind If you do it right you should never have to spend k on a PC That  is gonna last the next  years maybe even a decade That  is gonna stack up and most likely cost way more than the  pc if you include all the dlc and micro transactions and stuff I prefer to borrow a game then I feel inclined to buy it if I liked it even if Ive already finished it It feels good to support the developer and legally own a game Ive enjoyed Yeah but I only buy one PC I buy like  games My bookshelves cost more than a book deleted Yeah because the games as a service mentality has people in fp models in their  games I remember being excited for Overwatch and then not buying it because of Lootboxes Why would I buy a  game that has content that I cant get unless I spend more Thank god VR games are not suffering for the micotranaction cancer yet I think the hesitation to buy software is because no one feels like they own it anymore Everything has to be ongoing revenue for these companies or it is not worth it Thank god the indie scene is thriving or I probably wouldnt play anything tbh You only buy a pc once every couple of years but you can possibly buy hundreds of games and still have played them to boredom in the same time period Plus its not feasible to download a ti Very true My PC also does porn as well as video games if a  game came with a free porn movie I bet sales would skyrocket Well GTA V is  Play Warframe bruh  Waiting for sales and getting  dollar games for pennies on the dollar tho So true I filled my cart with  worth of games during the summer sale then conveniently forgot to check out Im the exact opposite Hardware Damn this RX  is  cheaper than the  it would be great to have it but I cant spend that much money on a rig Games Ive heard about this game once and never even bothered read any reviews and theres a  discount I must have it who knows when therell be a discount again depends on the game I guess Its not spending  on a game Its spending  on ANOTHER game You have to make that decision more often than with PCs Kinda similar to a few friends a mine but its more like sure ill spend  at the bar every weekend but  on a game is a no go Penny wise pound foolish I dont remember the last game that I bought I think it was Battlefield  I maybe played  hours before never touching it again I honestly think almost every new game is utter garbage now though I am quite interested in the upcoming Cyberpunk  Steam sales spending  on  games in total  of which youll ne er even play Yes This is me What if it goes on sale next week Well that  can surpass  or  console generation and still outperform latest consoles Interms of games I only invest in live and long running games I dont play single player anymore on day  as its too useless to invest  just to play single player that I will never ever go back Looking at the state of PUBG and the shitshow its devolving into Id say my  PC is a solid investment Thank you I just spent  on a new graphics card but really had to contemplate the  on the game I really wanted now that I had a card to really show it off  look at mr Money bags over here  Inb cdprojektred fans invade this post Computers can last a decade and have resale value Games can be complete shit Whelp at least Warframe is free and nice Wait until Prime Day were I will probably spend  then complain about filling my gas tank for  literally hrs later Recent games i have played leaves a lot to be desired Ffxv felt incomplete fc is the exact sameas fc and fc but with worse story fallout  not recent is just too dumbed down for kids for me to enjoy assassins creed origins is so boring same shit as before Same dead family member plot as every other assassins creed game Mafia  is absoulte dog shit and i regret wasting time there Cod died for me after BO This is the reason why ijust replay older games like witcher  skyrim dark souls gta viv batman series Mafia  crysis games without online as i hate it AAA games just suck these days The difference is I can pay  for my computer and know that Ill get my expected value back out of it and the value to use ratio only goes up the longer I have the computer For  I got EAs Star Wars Battlefront  An unbalanced unfun Star Wars themed COD skin Its a direct inverse of the computer investment because the longer I own Battlefront the worse I feel about the purchase and the more my capacity for human trust and love diminishes spending  dollars on food So I want Skyrim bit But I am not going to pay  I stayed up till midnight on  to get Skyrim its such a good game Please someone tell me the  bit is noticeably smother I was looking for it on some sites that swap BTC for steam codes found it on gg for like  Via gagcom I hate that kind of people I have a friend whos got  bucks worth of gaming set up and just download games for free illegally I wish I could download a pc Tell me about it People dont think it be like it do kinda related Just got a new GPU so for the first time in forever I can actually play AAA games now the question is which ones are worth the time and money Ive played Witcher  and the two new Tomb Raider games all of which I really enjoyed so what games along those lines should one play IT HAS TO BE WORTH IT I was about to buy HOI as the first game I have bought by itself in easily  years just checked humble monthly it was there Only chance of me ever buying a game when it comes out is Just Cause  assuming it works finedecent reviews that and Truck Sim DLC Except Ill spend  on a game with only minor hesitation If I know I have money and wont need it there is none Its basically become the reason paying to for things more important things are less of an issue for me compared to others around me If I can spend  on a game or hundreds on pc parts paying stuff I need doesnt hurt as much lol I can resell a computer part I cant resell a digital download in the US Fun coupons Twitch has been so amazing for my wallet Watching  minutes of gameplay has saved me  innumerable times Jesus Ive just realized how long it was since I bought a game for more than like  It really do be like that sometimes When you have Ganes and played  to the full potential and  you have with k hours I always dream of playing rough my growning library once I retire and stream a lot of it All the trash games as well like Jerma But I havent even got noshed school For me it is more like spending  on dinner vs spending  on a game It is one thing to build a really nice rifle but you dont always have to buy the best ammo to have fun hahaha i spent almost  on a PC but spent like only  on my csgo account i think its all but fair you cant pay equally to what you spent on a pc for a singlemultiple games I dont get why everything is

pair an i F with a ti if you want mind blowing performance for the buck I k rtx  gb ram The newest Ryzen  coupled with an RTX  Super Get yourself a good NVME SSD and a TB Intel p in a SATA adapter unless you have another m port Its not the best but its better than a hard drive and is only  or so gb of RAM or so and if were really talking about an unlimited budget get a Valve Index Also on the subject of VR dont get the Rift S or any other headset without an IPD distance between pupils adjustment For years I thought VR wasnt for me because my WMR headset couldnt accommodate my smaller IPD  and it made my eyes tired and burn Now I love my Rift Batmans computer I love your comic uSrGrafo Serious answer Ryzen is hot right now Most recommended builds use them due to priceperformance sweetspot Ryzen  or  if you have money to spend and want high performance Water cooling is popular and middle of the road water cooler would be the Hi You can also go with a giant Noctua air cooler if you dont want liquid cooling They are both good I like a TB system SSD personally I then put in two Western Digital Red hard drives and run them raid  striped This almost doubles their speed because they are written simultaneously Gives me a lot of cheap storage that isnt terribly slow For games I play a lot or have annoying load times put them on SSD for everything else throw it on my big ass data drive Video card is your call We dont know what kind of monitors you are trying to drive if you have a p Hz that you are gaming on and want to save money you can get by with a GTX  Super If you

their mums are packing LEDs round here Shouldnt we wait for next year to start this trend Or is this a yearly thing I havent improved in the last  years but this describes my PC setup perfectly There

deleted battlenet and origin and hid all of the Battlefield and Call of Duty games in my steam list I dont want to know anything about them RGB everywhere bishhhh Fuck Too accurate Thanks Amazon and your recent  fan pricing I finally get to join the RGB crowd Bullshit now you also have a widescreen monitor or more likely to have one Never thought Id see the day RAM had lights on it Did this meme exist  years ago s Square monitors were also phased out in favor of widescreen ones This is the kind of quality post I subscribe for What the hell is this  year challenge thing What is a good cheap rgb mechanical keyboard No rgb LEDs on the back on the monitor Cmon I genuinely miss  era gaming I love my RGB keyboard I have an rgb desk and PC but a standard keyboard Way too accurate  TIL I was a pioneer in  with a lit keyboard outstanding move Not enough RGB room needs to be synced and monitor needs back lighting Dont forget the GEFORCE RTX  Ti Im still in  Cant stand the rgb stuff Its the new insane armor looking cases I feel attacked I had the manager install really low power black light in the clanwar room back in  cybercafe and now i have everything turned off with the shiny dps

years left to be using the same PC for  years Im feeling personally attacked right now on a serious note i am so much more thankful for my computer than i was in  every console game now is  hours of cinematics with  minutes of gameplay that is usually quick time events if i had to choose between playing console games or playing no games at all i would just not play games Ive spent a good deal extra on my latest build just for RGBIve been bitten by the bug Inaccurate Where are the double monitors U l t r a w i d e Can you add more wrinkle and bags to the guy please Still using the same cpu tho Wow this was a bit personal Back then I wasnt connected to the internet in any way shape or form Good days But not all of us have RGB  too fucking real lolol Accurate I feel personally attacked Need more screens and more rgb You forgot the ultrawide monitor The retard lights are like a cancer that has infected everything but vital organs Well I mean its a laptop now too Me Only I have facial hair now And now my gf is mad at me because I laughed to loud and woke her up fixed httpimgurcomgalleryuSicyu AAARRRRR GEEEEE BEEEEEE Hahahaso stealing  borrowing this I use a red lighted keyboard

like everything looks nicer without it I had a blue light keyboard in  and I have one in  so I guess this leave me out Needs the other three monitors Ive gained since then And a  monitor Accurate The monitor needs to be at least  though deleted That monitor is too narrow Wouldnt the screen be wider too Im calling bullshit Everyone is on their phone now Lol i really want a mechanical keyboard but I still got my  Logitech one What about the gaming chair Meme of the year goes to  In  New year new format What unicorn poop all over keyboard rcomedycemetery no led gaming chair using the same monitor w o w Please help me to interpret this joke That poor driver will be blamed for everything all the time Even in the few cases its not its fault the cpu looks so cute i could pet it Wait how did he answer he doesnt speak their language grasp in cpu I couldnt find it at first but credit goes to usystemcomics Check em out at httpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomics httpstwittercomSystemComics httpswwwfacebookcomSystemComics Its more like all of them speak the same language but realy basic and then suddenly all of them speak it as their mothertounge Thank you for crediting me OP If you like to see more comics you can see them on my social media httpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomicshttpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomics httpstwittercomSystemComicshttpstwittercomSystemComics httpswwwfacebookcomSystemComicshttpswwwfacebookcomSystemComics This is weird because the CPU is actually the one computer component that doesnt require a driver Reminds me of this httpsyoutubefoTrsHmS But wait drivers arent used until the PC gets to the OS Who uses drivers for a CPU This made my day Wholesome They shouldve been sitting on a bus not at a table I guess you could say it was their designated driver So a processor expansion card and a mouse If they dont speak their language how are they conversing in the beginning Where can I found more of this D Isnt it the kernel that lets them talk httpsiimgurcomQpKbNCGpng Original Nothing happens Repost gets on hot posts and gets thousands of upvotes Reposti So wholesome Sorry to be so grumpy but aside from not finding this at all funny Im really annoyed with how inaccurate the analogy is The mouse and the graphics card are talking to and understanding each other how And the CPU needs a translator which is a driver That doesnt make any sense If anything it should be the CPU bringing the translator for all the rest with the translator being the OS This really helped me understand what a driver does Cute CPU why does the burger look squashed in the first panel The CPU is sweating thermal paste its so cute Shouldnt the GPU be the foreign one while the CPU is at the table Wholesome Repost from usystemcomics Awe this would be a great teaching tool My kids will love this rwholesome Didnt the Gpu like reply  How did it reply if it doesnt understand  I need answers Ifthe cpu doesnt naturally speak their language how does it know they want it to sit with them Wouldnt it be caught completely off guard that it can understand them at first if the driver was present the entire time I thought drivers were the interface between the hardware and the operating system I mean a driver is more a translation for the OS to hardware rather than CPU to hardwareright Your CPUMotherboard understands the GPU just fine or you wouldnt be getting a picture Drivers are for the operating system and software not the CPU The CPU can and does talk to the GPU through the BIOS Software can use that GPU without a driver if it has the correct privilege and the software developer has a hardware port IO map Drivers standardize multiple GPU port IO layouts so different software can use different GPUs without having to know the gritty details of how the hardware works Its also a securitycontainment mechanism to make sure a program cant crash your computer through improper hardware usage Its more for software development than for the OS Your welcome This has been your community nerd responding to meaningless wrongness on the internets over and out Also I still smirked Doesnt speak the language but knows the phrase Hey CPU come sit with us and thats ok we brought a translator Hmmmm seems fake I dont think this happened This looks exactly how I imagine a sentient cpu would look like I said do you speaka my language He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich And he said here mate  u deserve it Should make a version with an AMD driver drooling and licking the table How did they understand each other at the start without the translator How the fuck did he respond How did the cpu know what he initially said He may be a driver but please keep him talking and no driving in that world powerful gaming pc would be the bully assholes group  Thank you Then how did they have the initial conversation pretty dope everyone liked that rwholesomememes Hit em with the windows update bois And hes even sweating So cute Here we go again Nice Is this like a group suicide I see good wholesome memes i upvote But They talked without the driver facepalm Its so sweet I will hang my self You guys got it wrong The computer dont have a CPU The computer is the CPU and the IO devices are the weird people you need a OS to translate into something useable is the mouse ps or usb Awwww Butbut he understood them That driver is kinda cute Ill remember it the next time Ill bash him Working alone and already overheating I couldnt consistently run csgo for almost a month because i decided to update my drivers How did they communicate before the CPU knew there was a driver How were they talking in the first place Its comedycemetry anyway  This is the first time in eight months that hardware has made me smile instead of cry Nice Gotta love graphics cards with single fans directly on the pcb Brings back good times That CPU will be sweating for a long time What is driver I dont speak your language But understood LoL How did they he say that he doesnt understand stand their language if he doesnt understand their language Hmm considering the CPU is the central processing unit of the computer I feel this would work the other way around with the peripherals trying to join its table But whatever I cant draw at all so kudos on a funny comic     Damn this is the nerdiest shit If he doesnt speak their language  Thank you for this wonderful addition to my cubicle decorations where is os and firmware Unless youre using nvidia graphics on Linux Pretty sure the next best thing of a translator to the CPU is the kernel Is this a windows post Youre skipping over some closedsourced parts of your operatingsystem Fuck this reminds me I need to update my graphics driver Unrelated but I just updated Windows and my whole C drive is corrupted now Literally no program works Thinking of PC parts like this makes it way sadder that my GPU died speaks their language  sorry I dont speak your language This reminded me of something I meant to ask about Sorry about the tangent Back in the mid to late s all of my ATI card using friends used to make the joke I love ATI cards I cant wait until they make drivers for them Did ATI have a bad driver history during this time Looks like theyre both speaking English Waithowd they understand the CPUs first statement So touching Thats a good ELI of what a driver is Simple op Just spend your money on a new computer Im wondering why all people dont just do this Its a k with a GT Tomorrow I am printing this out and putting it on the outside of my cubicle How do the first two panels work if the cpu doesnt have the driver yet rcomedycemetery Super cute comic Thats great I love it The joy on his face at the end xDDD inb it is an Intel cpu CPUs dont need drivers This is fucking stupid Is that CPU dripping thermal paste Is this comic sponsored by The Verge I dont get it Is this some kind of rich person humour Im too broke to understand At first I thought the driver had a microphoneheadset But wait he knew what he said when responded by bringing a translator Why are they all so cute Ow its too wholesome but theyre all speaking english Technically it would be a hypervisor or an OS depending on a few things even then it would be more like the CPU is on the other side of a wall and youve got a messenger going back and forth between them Thank you That cpu is so cute i wanna overclock it The fun part is that they were talking together the entire time without the need of a translator This is cool D Aww Wait but they are all hardware and each needs a separate driver Wouldnt it make more sense if OS was the one saying it instead of GPU But He just replied to the GPU NANI OwO Las armas Guns Super cute uwu Nowwhat is the implication that the Driver is INSIDE the disc tray if they are living things here Talk about HARDware How did he understand that in the first place though if the driver hadnt done anything yet The poor CPU wheres his best buddy RAM The gpu is black The Driver is just a slave and does not get food until he earns it Unless youre Corsair then your translator is mentally retarded and in a coma This is rally wholesome OP thank you for sharing Nice A healthy meme If this was my laptop  that driver would be the bully punching the cpu until it was blue  damn you nvlddmkmsys The rest of my family would never understand this CPUChan wont you come sit with us oh nani CPUChan we brought a translator Execution error Your program had this runtime error Exceeded memory or invalid memory reference The program ran for  CPU seconds before the error It used  KB of memory Motherboard chipset sitting by itself lip reading the conversation Oh God I forgot the drivers makes the cpu understand component fuck been a while I study IT been working in the field for two years  rProgrammerHumor  months into PC ownership and I still cant get my Bluetooth to work because the Bluetooth thing apparently doesnt exist and cant be downloaded The first  hours were spent endlessly downloading drivers and watching YouTube videos on how to unfuck the thing to the way a Mac would have performed brand new But macs are expensive and cant game yeah I know But they last a decade and work  perfectly from the second you inbox them until the day you sell them on eBay for a surprisingly good amount  years later Such a better product just outrageously priced and cant run games Edit Ive had these issues with every windows product Ive owned since  Every single one I came here to be a bag of salt just let me be Repost Hopefully hes not an AMD or hes going to melt his new friends TBF the CPU needs it own driver and both drivers need to communicate through the OSs HAL Holy fuck this is a weak comic Theres no punchline and the entire setup doesnt even make sense because they are literally talking before the driver is even mentioned Haha Funny Maybe even  STUPIDContext is difficult though Theres an extra panel to this comic Whyd you leave it out I love it when the driver smashes its head into the table over and over and the graphics card and peripherals flash in and out of existence before becoming horribly malformed and mutated Perfect ELI material thats epi Learn about us and our historyhttpspcmasterraceorghistory PCMR isnt just a subreddit but a very large community founded in  that is ALSO on reddit Check them

wallet Hnngggno nut november failed I just lost No Nut November and also all the money in my wallet Micro Center is the best They must have great turnaround on product Its almost impossible to keep up with sales on NeweggAmazonTigerDirect etc Like RAM and SSD prices are constantly changing Where is this OP I need to move into a place nearby now removed AH THIEF HANG HIM DammitNNN just got a lot harder  The St Louis Park one has really gone downhill in terms of selection Lots of empty shelves Which store is that Itd be so amazing if there was a more accessible way for endusers to assemble their PCs Its an absolute joy to figure it out on your own but I guess most people are intimidated and never end up experiencing what PC gaming has to offer Ah Microcenter the place that actively invites you to scam their add on warranty The employees get a commission on the warranty so they actively encourage you to buy it use your video card for  months then return it getting  percent credit Buy another card probably significantly better because its  months later with the credit pay your  warranty cost I call it my rental fee and repeat indefinitely The employees love it because they keep getting their warranty commissions the front desk and management dont seem to care at all I dont even lie when I return it The fan is louder than when I bought it this one game keeps crashing Where heavy breathing can heavy breathing i heavy breathing find heavy breathing this the brown tones of MicroCenter Nah fuck off microcenter is Never that clean Stop I can only get so erect Jokes on your  I still cannot afford any of that shiny newer shit AhhhhHHHHH Oh god Sweet Jesus its everywhere Someone grab a towel When I was first starting to build my own PC around  or so we had computer shows near the local fairgrounds You could walk around and see demos of hardware and buy brand new stuff for less than retail It was so great I forget when they stopped happening but yknow probably around the time Amazon and other etailers got popular That looks WAY nicer than the selection of FRYS I grew up with Nicer selection nicer organization BUT do they have a spaceship on the side of the building at Microcenter D RIP OP Youre in heaven now Hell on earth for my bank account I was going through there in December at the peak of crypto mining and they sold a ti for retail as long as you could prove you cared more about FPS than hash rates I love that place I cant wait to browse this store but then look for better prices on the Internet drools Is that store in the EU If you strain your hearing just a little and the wind blows in the right direction you can faintly hear your Wallet crying in the background I have always lived in pretty small towns so I get excited going to

store Does anyone know if first born children are still acceptable forms of payment Whats the benefit of these stores Considering you can buy everything you want over the internet at your own leisure often at the best price and get fast shipping Please someone fill me in on this I remember that Euphoric feeling when they finally built a MicroCenter in Brooklyn NY Prior to that MC was just a store that I read about on other PC related forums Went one Friday after work and nearly wet my pants Moved to GA about  years and have an MC about  miles away from me A bit smaller location then the one I used to go to in NY but its still good to go Thats our Denver store This the Micro Center In Denver Ive spent lots om Money there The reason I build my own is because of the quality of the parts Not the specs themselves I was a bit disillusioned when I saw a prebuilt computer being sold for less than my custom build even though it had better specs but when it came right down to it the parts I

display k Hes itching for a GPU upgrade though so hes been saving his money Our PS and Wii are mainly dust collectors at this point My  year old plays on them maybe once every few months and in  years Ill be building a machine for him too Big mistake Youre raising your son to be a console peasant when he could have a better life with his own personal computer Its child abuse Your kid will never get to play PUBG  EDIT This post somehow caused a PS fanboy to PM me some angry words while bashing PC Im speechless some people are nuts If this actually offended you then you need to grow up FWIW I even own a PS I have a PS but really only use it for the odd exclusive Injustice  Madden But for the most part I just use it for blu Rays Netflix and other streaming services in my living room  raising a peasant and not teaching your own blood the ways of the masterrace ISHYGDDT I built my kids their own pc and now every time I come home my  year old son is downloading new mods for games Pretty soon he will know more about pc gaming than I do Child abuse Thats fucked up Creating a peasant just to keep PC gaming to yourself And youre doing that to your own progeny Just get them an equally priced Minecraft box to a PS and a few kids things on a steam sale Fucking child abuse Holy shit I cant believe you people upvoted this A true member of the master race would have built said  year old his own computer and started him down the path of the gods not given said  year old a fucking paper weight Peasantry Upvoting because I reallife lold D beloved So he gets to play Last of Us Shadow of the Colossus Horizon Zero Down FFXV Good for him psh like anyone on this sub has ever had sex While PC Gaming will always be my one true love Consoles do have their place I currently have an XBox One and Switch If the XBox One didnt play UHD Bluray I would probably have a PS Pro I really wish they didnt gimp it by not putting in a UHD player The PS exclusives are so much better than XBox Xbox kinda sucks The Switch tho I freaking love my Switch Zelda is the bees knees Also he can play Bloodborne now I want to believe it is true But it is from gag Imagine being this insecure Typical shitpost on PS subreddit Hey guys I was a PC gamer for my entire life and just bought a PS so glad I switched Circlejerk ensues with misinformation Yeah fuck that kid I bet hes an asshole A rollercoast of emotions For fucks sake OP label this with a warning for those of us with anxiety Mine do not touch my PC on pain of death I have so many PC games that Id like my kids to play but Ill be damned if Im giving them access to my PC or Steam account    they can play my GOG games on their own PC one day though If we were in a pro pcmr jurisdiction Id lynch you for child abuse Poor child The father should of built a computer with his son JUST SAYING Why Why not buy him a computer for the same price and if if money becomes a concern Why not set him up with a cloud gaming computer If it wasnt for my dad having a PC and letting me touch it get yelled at for messing it up and all I probably would be a loser bum on dead tour instead of having a high end programming analyst job I have today I wanted to play the games back then you had to do a lot so the computer would have enough memory allocated to play the games Id not be able to get it to work and learn from that How to critically thinktrouble shoot Id mess things up and get a talking to and I would learn from that How to understand the impacts of what you do to downstream users But most of all it made me just understand the PC and architecture and how things work Because just knowing how to computer goes a long way in the business world ewww gag How did he survive for  years The only reason i would even think about getting a console would be because of Nintendo actually having exclusives All the other games is getting released on PC anyways Plus i play a lot of fighters and the PC versions of fighting games doesnt have the input delay as the console versions do have This is why i bought my son a Wii U While he loves it i still had to build him his own damn PC so he would let me game in peace I doubt an  year old would care about the difference between p and pseudo k anyway Seems like a vanilla PS would be better for them I dont get the hate I have a nice PC with a ti in it and I recently bought a PS Pro I am enjoying all the exclusives ive missed out on like Last of Us Uncharted Destiny Horizon Zero Dawn Why cant we all have both Is that gag Hahaha yes same here I have never been into consoles What a roller coaster My  year old tells me PC games are the best thanks to Youtube videos This is child abuse  Bloodborne The Last of Us God of War Final Fantasy  Persona  Horizon Zero Dawn Spiderman Uncharted  and Until Dawn are all worth getting a PS PCMasterRace Some heroes dont wear capes dont touch my PC thats what i say but they touch it anyway Why would you subject him to those nasty fps I want to get a PS Pro though so I can play Gran Turismo at K with VR support Please dont kill me removed Why cant I upvote this more the once Already stolen without credit by gamingbible have they no shame I have a  year old son He has his own computer constructed from usedhandmedown parts waitdoes pc gaming exist  years ago In all honesty the PS Pro does kick ass I have a GTX  in my PC but Windows always pisses me off and there arent really any local multiplayer games that I want to play for the PC so it has been relegated to a HTPC year shudder I did enjoy horizons new dawn But yeah That was about the extent of it Now so and I are back to ark my emotions has been cheated at least twice What a twist That didnt go the way I thought it would Bravo Lmao I would do the same thing Damn haha yeah Gg rUnexpected Introducing the macrotransaction Its genius Make themselves the monster in order for a hero to be created and they made the hero themselves What if I wanna be a Sith huhh Not gonna give me that choice For those who havent been following Apex Legends was apparently very much rushed past marketing and released on announce day to avoid the corporate influence Apex Legends is a monster success This is EA going ohhhhh Now rock the boat by announcing its epic store exclusive deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk This doesnt mean the game is good They created this problem and now theyre acting like theyre saints for not adding MtX Thats not good it should be the default While I am hopeful EA is the shadiest of shady publishers Anyone with a cursory understanding of the situation should know to wait until multiple trusted outlets have reviewed the game before buying NO PREORDERS NERF HERDERS For all we know EA could step in an intentionally make the story terrible just so they can go see We told you No one wants story driven single player games anymore what are everyone even talking about every Star Wars game made by EA is a marketing campaign towards a new movie they dont care about microtransactions and shit the whole battlefront  fiasco was EA trying to squeeze a bit more money but failing to do so battlefront   nov  movie  dec  battlefront   nov  movie  dec  fallen order  nov  movie  dec  Watch for falling DLC Its gonna super short Im calling it The only way EA would allow it be  bucks cut and dry is if it didnt take an enormous amount of money Well battlefield  didnt have that till recently so I presume theyll probably add it back in the future Trust no one Yawn No loot boxes or anything but you can get the Jedi edition for  it includes  new lightsaber colors  skins and a Star Wars duffelbag This is actually gross even if they do stick to their word They are acknowledging that their own practices are trash without apology and in the form of marketing for another game Ew Trying to recoup some positive public perception after Battlefront  and Anthem and the bioware controversy Apex is still pretty well monetized and not at all unfair whos to say this wont also stick to what they say Respawn is the only AAA dev at EA they let use something other than Frostbite and they gave them the Starwars license If anyone at EA can pull of something consumer friendly its probably Respawn Its funny how this marketing is basically EA admitting microtransactions are bad but theyre still gonna keep at it This will go down like this  day  DLC  preorder bonus  Special edition that costs   Season passes  A sequel announced a week after release that contains the rest of the game  Sequel riddled with microtransactions EA bad CDPR good Orange arrows left This sounds as convincing as Windows  when you get an upgrade All your files are right where you left them This is like an abusive boyfriend telling you Ive changed while just changing up their methods of manipulation Wow congrats EA its the first game in a fucking while that doesnt have those things Its nothing to brag about when you look at literally every other game they release Plus its expected that a single player only game wouldnt have those Im ready for my sense of pride and accomplishment On the deluxe edition theirs cosmetics DAE EA bad I bet they are gonna release a coop game that is unfinished No we are not well just let you be without any microtransactions apart fron the  price point Inb they set it out to be DLC heavy So they lock up content youd think to already be in the  full price part and it ends up being bareboned EA needs a PR win on the Star Wars front and Respawn seem to have some supernatural ability to resist EAs meddling Im going to say I cautiously optimistic on this visible confusion Chapter   chapter   each  Months Later xB SO THAT WAS A FUCKING LIE THEY ARE LYING Honestly Its probably Disney telling them not to fuck around with this one or else they lose Star Wars Doubt X EA gets a lot of hate and a lot of it is warranted for sure But that said a lot of the things that EA gets blamed for is just as much the fault of the developers as it is EAs  sometimes more if you believe what the developers are telling us or have been following any of Jason Schreiers reporting Turns out EA is actually pretty handsoff with their developers For the most part with the BIG exception of not letting devs use UE and pushing them to use Frostbite a requirement that Respawn somehow manages to avoid multiple sources and multiple devs have said again and again that EA gives their developers a LOT of rope to hang themselves with which may not always be a good thing To quote BioWares founder The best analogy I use in a positive way is EA gives you enough rope to hang yourself It was really interesting because we really made all the choices we wanted to make ourselves these are all things we wanted to try  That was the biggest revelation that rope that EA gives you they dont secondguess you they dont say you shouldnt do that We had complete creative control over a lot of it some fans didnt like some of it and some of it was experimental quite frankly yes because a couple of mistakes a company makes means that they are the worse company ever haha eapic bad Seriously guys this sub is becoming the circlejerk they dont need any more money after Apex lmao No microtransactions but no one said anything about no cosmetic dlc packs Congrats EA youve done the bare minimum to not fuck your customers Cant wait for the other shoe to drop Its just gonna be the worst PC port mankind has ever seen Im calling it Im calling story episodes like how the Life Is Strange etc I want to believe it so bad but I cant get my hopes up httpiimgurcomUfbrejgif ea bad Just a reminder for anyone just crawling out from their  rock DO NOT PREORDER THIS GAME FOR THE LOVE OF JEEBUS Just dont preorder it Bro I love Chicken Run Is this for real If so then i might actually buy something from EA again after years of ignoring them Ive already seen a few comments on social media from people saying they will preorder the game just because its single player and supposedly no mtx No gameplay footage no other details facepalm Im waiting for the announcement that theyve pivoted the design to mobileonly You all have phones right Diddnt they say this for BF but it ended up beong a lie So what do they want A pat on the fucking back for making a full game with no bullshit attached Thats how its supposed to be Can someone help me understand this And no we wont be adding them Isnt that similar to a double negative meaning they will add them So they should be saying And yes we wont be adding them Idk if its right or not No its respawn thats why Respawn basically does whatever they want this is EA capitalizing on that A desperate attempt to gain some respect This is probably going to suck and we all know it Its going to be an Epic Store exclusive I reported their account on twitter for being hacked no srsly Thats exactly the same shit they said for battlefront  be skeptical be very skeptical httpsiimgurcomLaJKmogif Im calling it right now theyre going Episodic Thats my current theory anyway ITS A TRAP Echo bulllllllllshit achoo Yes but actually no EA if you think releasing one game that you havent filled to the brim with dirty fee to pay revenue generators will make everything right you are out of your minds You have killed off countless studios I and many others love and absolutely bastardised and ripped to shreds IP that we loved NFS is a Joke Sims is a cash cow and Deadspace is a long forgotten dream Oh look were making a starwars game and we wont rip you off Thats the bare minimum expectation you sorry excuse of a disfunctional pleague Christ Rule Number one never trust EA This is like an abusive relationship yeah change is on the horizon but the problem is you cant actually reach the horizon Thats true thats damn ture Press X to Doubt Can you maybe stop shilling over this shit Just let it die like it will shortly after release anyway Its sad when thats the sentence you use to try and sell your game Seasonal DLC plans and Passes Oh thanks ea for advertising whats NOT IN THE GAME Now to sell a base game for  because dlc and season pass And in the end its a sp MMORPG Im gonna nope the hell out on that Respawn must have a lot of saying over EA since the spaex Launch  Only thing I can think of is restoring positive customer relations Its like when a husband beats his wife everyday then doesnt for a week and the wife praises his lack of beatings he dealt Presses X to doubt X doubt It will just be a shitty short  hour game with  DLCs instead to get all the episodes Trust me Respawn entertainment folks The creators of Titanfall and Apex legends Well see how this one plays out but I wouldnt worry TOo much To this very day EA still has no idea what Respawn is or what its doing I know its so hard to trust them when weve been fucked so many times Theres no pleasing you people Every time you press W it costs  They arent loot boxes guys they are star card packs Know the difference Inb monthly subscription required always online single player game Get ready for only half a game with the other half coming in  separate  DLCs Releases unfinished game followed by a handful off DLCs that are  each  DLCs that are all cut from the game  It will still just be a rushed half assed game lmao New model Every level is dlc Whether this is EA turning a new leaf or another guise to manipulate its consumers my days of preordering a game or buying it on the first week of launch are over I am now a gamer who waits to see the reviews and average playtime of actual consumers Im done with marketing and thats coming from a guy who has a marketing degree and several years experience in the field Didnt bother to watch the trailer i mean its ea You dontt have to include microtransactions if you have to pay a monthly fee Taps head Its like being in a relationship with a serial cheater and then they say Just give me a fourteenth chance I promise this time Ill be loyal Nahh Im good bro You can fuck off The fact that theyre bragging about not having microtransactions in an offline single player game makes me legitimately upset especially when people start praising corporate for it They shouldnt be praised for correcting an issue they themselves introduced I like how they know gamers hate microtransactions and loot boxes to the point where not including them is a selling point Yet they go ahead and stuff them into almost every game they make anyways Build bridge on fire Cross this bridge the fire wont hurt  xB Build bridge not on fire Cross this bridge this time is not on fire Half way through the cross sets the bridge on fire  xB Build new bridge not on fire Cross this bridge this time I wont set it on fire  yeh I think Im going to skip this time I miss the days of expansions where the only reason It wasnt a new game was because it was the same engine There is a  min time limit and everytime it runs out you have to pay an additional  to unlock the rest of the campaign also featuring exclusive star wars content and never before seen footage of Yoda and Jar Jar going to a strip club on Naboo Only real Star Trek fans are allowed EA will make some sort of greedy twist somehow They always do I want to give Respawn the benefit of a doubt But EA AND Disney Too much corporate to know this wont go down well They didnt say anything about DLC so theyll be adding lootboxes in the form of a DLC I suspect they take the Train SimulatorCreative Assembly path and have a fuck ton of DLC like needing to pay for the blood in a total war game i love how we tell EA to get their shit together and when they do we dont trust them Respawn is EAs best developer in the current climate IMO their last  games have been fantastic and innovative I am not going to pre order or let my guard down but Im going to let myself get excited about something Star Wars again that looks really cool I believe EA has already hit the peak of their greed and is now looking at whats actually working Those suspicious motherfuckers NotMyEA MakeEATerribleAgain Yeah I saw it on a PC Whats a PC Youll find out  years ago Framerate doesnt matter anyways Now  YES  So itll probably be fps in p and fps in k For me its the best use of this meme yet Not bad at all mate When they said that they were adding something new and revolutionary that had never been seen before I was genuinely excited Then I heard them say fps I guess you guys arent ready for hz but your kids are gonna love it I like to think PC stands for Performance Console At the end of the day I really hope consoles achieve these framerates would give more encouragement on cross platforming to PC and I would be able to play games with all my old high school buddies who all play on consoles Been a while since Ive seen Marty And its not even real yet Yeah but console gamers arent saying this console marketing heads and console sales are saying this Also true of pretty much any iOS feature lol You ever play quake  in fps Its  and Im still gaming on a p hz monitor I need help Yo Beaver its Kevin SmBr is that you Holyshit if it is Its not about power though it is about how the dev wants to develop it give it  years if that long and the framerate will be right back to a very inconsistent  What console is getting fps This is the best thing I have seen in my life I have a feeling a lot of the kids here are not going to get the reference Console gamer When this baby hits  fps youre gonna see some serious shit Console explodes Reverse this for console exclusives though I can smell the sweat and dorito dust through my screen When they said that all I could think of was  on what Ha Okay I KNOW the benefits of PC gaming and have been an enthusiast for agesbut as a dude who can just afford a reduced price consolegame here and therethis is still funny as hell Last console purchase was a Switch was gifted an X years ago from friends I love I salivate over the power a gaming PC has but my last build is old and even after adding a decent GPU can only handle modest graphics mods to FNV I would certainly LOVE to build a moderngame capable rig but do not have the patience or budget to do soa full console that costs me  Switch with Breath of the Wild  before dlc and a preorder of Mario Maker  cost me less as my GPU that just makes me beautify a game Ive loved and played for years I got the Switch and BOTW at  off and  off respectively due to a store going out of business MM I actually preorderedstill spent  on the GPU This is not a defence of consoles nor an attack on the PCMRits just the opinion of a broke impatient gamer who just LOVES to game For whoever reads this justgame on on whatever hardware you want Edit do not know how a flair got added I was watching E with my boyfriend when the new console was unveiled I giggled when they said  fps Boyfriend looked at me and I said I was getting   years ago now my new comp goes way beyond that And he just went THIS ISNT ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER LIZZ GOD And I giggled again at how triggered he was  would mock again This is by far one of the best PC vs console memes I have ever seen Take this upvote you man of class deleted Does  really make a huge difference over  Asking for a friend     Lol             FPS on a  inch tv How much I mean I get the joke but Red Dead  would like to have a word with you Memes like this are why I come here Thank you Everyone But TVs can only do hz herp derp an dur eyezzz cun only du fps xB xB xB Some of the newer k TVs thatve come out the last  years can do a true hz  p not that TRUmotion or whatever the fck Samsung and other manufacturers use Havent seen any p ones that do a true hz yet but then I havent had to look Solid state drive paired with an SSD honestly how dumb do they think people who are going to buy their product are Im high right now And this meme is fucking aweso I love BTTF Its one of my favorite films However the actor in the coonskin hat will forever be Kevin Arnolds older brother sees a ssd Can a mod DM me  Im having my contributions deleted automatically for no reason I LOVE that movie Great meme  You guys arent ready for that yet but your kids are gonna love it Console doesnt even get  I cant wait for games to still be fps because devs are pushing for graphics You beat me to it If you have a link in your comment people will clickhttpsmyoutubecomwatchvdQwwWgXcQ it Its not gonna work because most people have a hz TV Press L to crouch lol console bad lmaoaoaoa Theyre spewing shite mate Incredible K and  FPS So much fucking lying holy shit Theyd wish the box would pull a stable  FPS at an upscaled K What movie or show was used for this I would buy a pc if i could afford it lol  fps fucking casuals hz is where its at Theyll play it on their k hz TV and claim they can see the k and  fps I dont understand how console gamers can be excited about this new console The Xbox one or ps could barely hold fps when they released It took  more iterations of each console to even get close to holding fps in any title Now this console is touting fps Legit I will eat my own foot if its a stable fps in p at launch It wont be Fuck you nice repost Why are people more concerned with frame rates rather than gameplay and story Credit where credit is due it is SUPPOSEDLY  FPS at K I had no idea Back to the Future memes were a thing thank you for opening my eyes Yeah brand new on consolesthis is getting old quick It checks out As console gamer can confirm What they were talking about in the movie cries in Monster Hunter World Absolutelynotmeirl Someone did this yesterday with the same meme Yeah new on console rcomedyheaven laughs in Hz deleted GTA IV This wasnt always true The little kid looks like a young version of the guy who played the punisher but I cant remember his name right now  But have you experienced it with a controller while laying down If yes please lmk your setup Console makers say that but not most console gamers I dont know any console player who thinks console can be better than PC Flip that meme and you have Halo deleted Ok I just came across this post because its on the front page Whats the context for this meme I guessing they expect console gamers to have  hertz display or a tv Is it weird that I read both subtitles in their voices I actually only remember that kids voice because of the subtitle Havent seen the movie in some years although I have seen them a fair few times mfw my pc doesnt get that much and i spend  on it  Excellent meme OP Pc is too much of a dedication towards videogames lol god dammit good job I thought  came after  Hey Ive seen this meme ive seen this meme Its a classic So are we just going to act like Xbox and PlayStation exclusives dont exist As a console gamer I approve this message Just started watching the second BTTF yesterday and Im already seeing memes about it Why is his mom the frame rate Best meme of the year first ones a hit confirmed I saw this  season ago Good meme Its especially funny because Im pretty sure this was posted less than a week ago Hmmm Im guessing this guy forgot about red dead  Wait is that the brother from The Wonder Years Unless were talking about GTA V As someone thats terrible at comparing specs does the Scarlet best my GTX  and i k Nobody thinks this That kid looks like Wayne from the Wonder Years Fuck this format has some serious investment potential Console I have  fps PC yeah but how fast is your tv Console what do you mean As both a PC gamer and a console gamer I appreciate this Prob  fps in some light ass game Inhales Xbox project Scarlet ray tracing fps k Im afraid of seeing hz because my wallet and eyes have only seen  so far Wont you need a Hz TV for that Lol  get a Gaming PC instead much cheaper and much better I think they mean K or maybe even k fps which is dull pretty impressive by PC standards This is amazing Bet they cant wait for  fps on their moms tv Whats this meme from Nobody can see it ITS FASTER THAN THE EYE CAN SEE Most TVs cant even support  FPS and what about  haha Even though we already have it the concept of a console being able to manage fps and k is neat I wonder what is more common Hz monitors or SLI and Crossfire for gaming Also seeing over fps is new No Ill buy that for a  Never before seen on a console imagine xbox announcing integrated windows in project scarlett But but its still a lot in pc just yall to Xbox th comment I was showing my friend HalfLife the other day Told him it was running at fps He said he didnt see the difference between that and his xbox I let him get a feel for the gameplay then said press that button there and pointed to a button that locks the game FPS to  same as my refresh rate He immediately complained that the game didnt feel as smooth Scott Great it is Me after finally downloading Steam and buying FNV after playing it on PS True tho Theres  fps on console Right through the heart Errgghhh I approve I feel like the only person whos fine with  FPS on my gigantic tv instead of a tiny hz monitor I just switched my monitor to  Hz for the heck of it and god it looks awful I dont understand how I ever played like that The mouse pointer alone was giving me a headache Stop hating guys The new xbox will play raytraced Pong at fps K Xbox one x supported fps Im certain early games hit fps easily if devs wanted to Especially such from XBOX One and PS Its going to get interested once we are on the middle of the road with those new consoles and PC gamers can tell whether a new graphics card will be necessary or not XBOX fans in recent update of the new console That epic gamer moment when you are getting your first pc this week yeah now I bet they wont be saying theres no difference from  FPS huh Just got a hz monitor I can relate finally fps gaming came in around  with starcraft  and league of legends Nice to see consoles will have this feature  years later Replace fps with SSD and it still works My last  years have been using an SSD Will console gamers still defend fps is better because you cant see more than  and  is more cinematic Saving this for later Reverse this and edit to Halo MCC Its cool that console gamers are finally being gave the respect from console makers to have both resolution and FPS Still though its only took about  years all my friends its brand new me what do you mean For real lolz So many typos rpatientgamers Edit Never thought Ill get a silver for a  day old comment Thanks Or if you have anything Nintendo wait  years still pay full price Ive found I have too much in my steam library that I actually intend to play Many are older titles Ive started going through them in alphabetical order making some decent progress until I went to grad school Ive purchased the odd title in between when I see things like  off and what not Now that Im handing in my research I have become Pooh Plus lots of the bugs get worked out and some killer mods are done Borderlands  instantly comes to mind I just refer to it as Gaming on an Adult Timeframe Still feels like Witcher  came out last month for me Depends on the game If its a game that I anticipate the multiplayer for Id rather pay full price now and enjoy the MP scene before metas evolve and the fun of a fresh MP game with a overflowing player base ends xB But if its for a SP game Id like to check out eventually then fuck ya bud lol Better yet waiting  years so you can play n games on an emulator for completely free We play the long game Add a third panel Never playing it Witcher  At  youre getting ripped off Wait for  P You mean getting it on Humble Bundle for  Borderlands  Ill see you in  Skyrim I sincerely dont think Ive ever bought a PC game for full price Unless Im dying to play it Ill just wait for a deep discount and play something else until then Steam had a massive deal where you could buy every single borderlands game every DLC and character skin which at full price was around  USD was on sale for USD You bet I bought that Still havent beaten the first borderlands tho and I havent touched the nd or the presequel Why the fuck does Gearbox make  Collectors Edition bundles that cost as much as car payment Theres no fucking reason for this no way does it cost  for a fucking RC Claptrap deleted Looking at you Borderlands  Basically me I do it because Im poor There arent any new meme formats anymore only old ones in new skins I guess This meme was used incorrectly This should have been a Drake meme The Pooh meme is for saying effectively the same thing in fancier language Everyone should do this most games are overpriced crap anyway Also waiting a decade to play AAA titles on now affordable hardware  Yup and thanks to Epic doing that is getting easier and easier  This is actually extremely easy to do since Im so backlogged with older games that have been out for  years that I havent started yet Just started Skyrim first time on the Switch Its not always about the discount Except for nintendo when its still the same game at full price Me with Borderlands  now You people need to get price protection credit cards with  year claim periods Recently bought Titanfall  for  Worth every penny Or wait  months for Borderlands  to be released on steam Pooh with glowing brain Getting the game for free from publishers With the way AAA games are nowadays all you have to do is wait like  or  weeks for them to go like  to  percent off in sale GOTY meaning Amen brother Or better yet you typically only have to wait about a year to get triple A  games for less than  I picked up Far Cry  in late Feb for  Game was out for about  months I think its funny how so many people will wait years for a GOTY version to come out before buying but waiting  year for Outer Worlds to come out on Steam is too much to ask  bucks Its  on Amazon httpswwwamazoncomgpproductBMHVGrefppxyodtbdasintitleoieUTFpsc Borderlands  for me This is what I do  Thats how I got The witcher   Skryim  Fallout  and Shogun   Wow did you watch me buy Witcher  GOTY last week for  Really the way many AAA games ship broken or glitchy these days waiting is better from a mental health prospective I cant help but feel like this is what caused quality games becoming fewer and more far between Nobody is gonna pay  for a game when they know if they wait just a couple of months they can buy it with all the dlcs for the same price or significantly cheaper Sale numbers drop investors back away massive corporations scoop up the bust company and push out a cookie cutter game with the series sticker slapped on it Meanwhile shit battle Royale games are being pumped out with a  price tag that imbeciles with throw money at for a God damn character skin Im no fan of preordering either though I feel like the most responsible gamer waits for a game to be released reads and watches some reviews then buys it I did this unintentionally with Borderlands  Didnt know it existed until like  Yeah Who told you Thats exactly me Not even These days you get the full game for less than half the price in about  months Witcher  I just got GTA V Shit is still  Jokes on you Civ VI came out  years ago and if you want all the DLC youre still looking at an  purchase I got the witcher  GOTY edition with DLC last year for  Did that for FONV game of the year edition Worth it  Preorders  Buys Day   Waits for GOTY  Pirates As a person who just bought Witcher  GOTY for roughly  and is enjoying his first playthrough I rate this meme accurate Pirating it thats how mafia works Dude Asif PCMR mods remove a comment because it talks about torrents Worst mods in the world how the hell do you become PCMR mods without having an inclination into the life of a PC gamer Absolute shills now disgrace Sekiro and me right now deleted Titanfall  at  Best money I ever spent Speaking of this Im planning on building a pc and I was thinking about buying Destiny  Its gonna be cheap as dirt I assume I liked the first game a lot and I havent bought the second one because I learned my lesson not to spend  on dlcs on a barebones base game Is it worth buying in late  if I liked the first game Witcher  Got Far Cry  Gold Edition the other day on Steam for  worth the wait I see you are a man of integrity like me I want sekiro really bad should I wait for a the prise to decrease or buy now what do you guys think This is my attitude to games now Usually means I can pick up used hardware for cheap too Its also a fact that if you wait a few years to play a game it will run smoother and you will get a higher frame rate due to it being old Even if you use the exact same PC At this point buying a game immediately on release should be done only by people who really really want to play it Everyone else whos interested should just get a special edition that combines the base game all the patches and any extra DLCs a year or two later preferably during a sale Except for the Division  That shit is still full price on Steam Heck yeah just got dragon age inquisition goty worth it lol The only game I have ever preordered was Middle Earth Shadow of War Thats also probably the only game I will ever preorder or buy full price I got just cause  for   would wait forever again For single player games totally makes sense I will plug Green Man Gaming though for people who are less patient They typically have some great deals on new games You can usually get games  off at launch with them Or just go to rsteamgameswap on release and buy at half price because people are selling their codes that come with device bundles I wish I could wait that long Doom  got it for  dollars Definitely the latter I just bought metal gear solid v for  dollars on greenmangaming Ill be seeing Red Dead  in  for about  at the Christmas sale Civ  For real though this is exactly how I buy and play games learned it from xkcd in high school witcher   You are overpaying I go  or below And getting more content than release looking at you battlefront  I did that with horizon zero dawn Waiting  months after the EGS release for the Steam release Was looking forward to playing on my PC but EGS Im new to PCMR but Im gonna suffer and play on my One S Ill get it on steam when it comes where is the dead one with Realizing that only works on single player games because all your friends have moved on and you have no one but randos to play with Having to hear all your buddies talk about the game and being left out is shitty though Im already tracet torrenting the game before the realease  ALLTHEDLC Middle earth shadow of mordor be like Nice I just did this with borderlands  for  xB Maybe not  years but yeah Totally Not only youll get the game cheaper but also with all DLC and fully patched The only games that I will ever break this rule is for Cyberpunk and maybe The Elder Scrolls  The only game ever I bought on premiere up to this day was Hugo The Evil Mirror but lets not talk about that Dumb And thats why I still havent played the Witcher  Plus saving shit loads of money on not needing a top end rig Looking at you MSV  I recent started gaming again and I had stopped when I had a  I just bought Arkham City Red Dead  and Fallout  all for like  These games are AWESOME I dont even have xbox live anymore It makes me wonder why a lot of big game series have stopped paying attention to making great story modes Of course now I want the newer versions of these games so Im thinking about getting an Xbox One Not only the price but my long back log makes me wait too Spiderman God of War and RDR can wait a bit Hell I waited until Arkham Knight was completely fixed on PC Then I picked it up with all its DLC for  Whats that saying again Only fools rush in I wish this would work for someone like me that likes to play online multiplayer games After  years a lot of online games are completely dead Feels like missing out on all the fun to be had at launches Never playing it after buying it because of a newer  game you just bought which is what happens to me almost all the time I tried the rpatientgamers thing but I found that if I missed the initial launch window for a game I was far less motivated to play it at which point I was better off not buying it This is my plan for Sekiro I knew I wasnt the only one who did this kinda thing deleted Unless its Nier Automata Are you asking if a meme subreddit likes memes You still need the big ass gfx card Breath of the Wild GOTY Edition  Love the game but Nintendo tax is real That not quite true anymore Most  year old games Ive been waiting to drop wont go below  And barely hit below  on sale And I swore to myself never to buy a game for more than  Whats worse is that theyll charge an additional  for all the DLC GOTY with all DLC  years and maybe  Fable  and  for  at goodwill this morning Uh thank you very much  More like  at the pace were going Youre using the meme incorrectly Its not just a reskin of the drake meme Whoa this guy with  money Ill wait for the Steam sale and pay  bucks GOTY Mainly because my computer cant run the new games Just bought the Borderlands Handsome Collection on steam for  Buying it on GA for  Thats me I recently picked up assasins creed origins with Dlc and all for about  Man it was weird playing gta years later I was so overhelmed by the game but it felt like I was the only one on the world who played it I like cheap memes Wouldnt the Drake format be better for this Mastercard Tho it depends on your bank Ive seen Visa offering equivalent insurances Forgot to add the Waiting  years for it to be on gamepass Yeah Ive really been enjoying Fallout  and DOOM I wonder what great Fallout game Bethesda will cook up next Waiting  months to get it on Steam Add a rd panel with a Pirate Pooh Pirating the game two days before release I do this on console how is this pc master race Or couple of months if its a battlefield game Also your mediocre gpu can run it in ultra Plus I can probably play it on my cheaper PC Although saying that I just picked up Just Cause  for  and its catching up to my hardware rniggawhat Or waiting yrs because your pc will run it Thats how I feel about new phones s I wish that worked for major life purchases car house university healthcare etc Never really understood this I mean Im all for saving money where you can but  years isnt worth  Haha try  in a fanatical bundle with  other games This is also just part of growing up Priorities shift and things that were really important just arent as you mature Youre not as susceptible to the hype machine of the latest and greatest or FOMO When I see a new Marvel trailer I say to myself I look forward to seeing that on Netflix in  months I guess itll be Disney now When I see a new game Im interested in I try to remember it for the next Steam summer sale or whatever Maybe in a couple years Ill see it for  bucks and be all stoked Civ vi gold for me not paying the  thats listed on steam currently Borderlands  on the Epic store be like yup thats me I do this all the time I play MMOs so that really helps me keeping from buying full priced game HOWEVER I did preorder MX cause I love fighting games So when new fighting games come out I tend to buy them right away My Fo experience in a nut shell One time I saw fallout new Vegas GOTY for  online I was thinking what a fucking bargain  I bought the witcher  GOTY Edition for  a few months after it was available Like  weeks later it was like  That one hurt lol Pirating it because the lack of DRM makes it an objectively better product I though it was the only way to do You will be mine seikiro For  Pirating a game to get it for free Fancy Fancy Anybody thinking about doing this for Mortal Kombat  Lol just did this with The Witcher

already have a decent pc Firefox has this nice little feature that removes your history from address bar search suggestions and as for web search I am pretty sure you can get rid of search suggestions a friend taught me this Use profiles Or private browsing Or tunnels Or a VPN Or a different browser even Do people even actually have this issue anymore or is this just a meme I have literally  sympathy for you if this actually does happen because its so preventable I got banned from PC Part Picker because someone made a meme build and people were shitposting in the comment section I posted a bit from a copypasta relevant to the build go back on the next day cant log in anymore I go to the Discord for the site and ask why turns out I was permanently banned for a sentence of copypasta incognito mode incognito for the win Fucking novices need to learn about private browsing Ah yes My fantasy build May she one day become a reality I mean how much do you buy new parts for your computer I just dont understand this Like most people do that maybe once a year Why would you check like weekly Actually Im a good child who never have and never will look at that stuff so cant relate Everyone is mentioning Incognito mode or private browsing as its called in other browsers but one better use a sandboxed browser On Windows Sandboxie is pretty easy to use and will do an infinitely better job of either keeping you safe or getting rid of your data there must be a browser extension that will help you accomplish this task But whys my mom on my PC She has her own Just clear your history Fucking OUYA lol Soulja boy really ties this together What have we become  The whole industry is fucking itself Consoles are getting the worst parts of PC gaming and PC is getting the worst parts of console gaming  video card exclusivity Mark my words I do wonder how much Epic store only games will be pirated For tons of people they wont care about epics shitty security or the data stuff But those that do will probably either just ignore the games until they come to steam if they come to steam OR will yarharho the games Oh how the turn tables Soulja Boys Face Kills it Youre right either way its a bad comparison tho No matter what store we buy from at least its not exclusive to an entirely different platform like with Xbox vs PS Maybe I am just looking on the bright side but at least I will still be on PC WTF is OUYA doing here the simple joys of a monkey knife fight The key difference between these  scenarios is that consoleexclusives require a monetary investment if you didnt already own all these different platforms Theres no barrier of entry on PC Youre free to buy from whatever store you please There is a  chance of epic games taking over due to their non customer friendly everything The amount of people that dismiss every point against Epic and boil it down to just installing another launcher is really disappointing I see this differently with consoles you have users arguing over exclusives out of pure spite for one anothers userbases On PC an open platform you have people arguing against the anticompetitive and anticonsumer actions of epic A truly valid fight that cannot be allowed to become the norm Wait Who is actually rooting for epic games As the meme shows Epic games store is a direct attack against the pc master race thats why we shouldnt support ANY game released exclusively on the epic store If you want to compete do it offering better support for the user or a competitive price or a better service Buying exclusives dont helps users it restrict the freedom to choice and its therefore an anticonpetitive strategy We became the very thing we swore to destroy Epic bad Exclusivity needs to die a death Put your game out on PC everywhere and let people play it where they want For consoles I assume the coding is different between consoles so I guess its more difficult Ideal world would be every game comes out on everything and we just let people play how they like though Epic are only getting these deals by undercutting the others Thats the only reason not because theyre good in any way  the CEO has even said they dont care about consumers but they will win because publishers like them They dont care Being undercut by half in any industry is ALWAYS BAD FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY I always think it is ridiculous when people say Lol I just buy it on PS and dont have to deal with exclusives I mean the reason we are up in arms over epic is because they are doig on PC what console manufacturers have been doing for ages and that even worse as it requires specific hardware Can we get a PirateBay sitting on the balcony above watching the whole thing I dont give a crap about Steam but I do not like trust or rely upon the Epic Games store and I certainly wont be supporting it The only competition for Steam Ive ever considered good for consumers was GOG but DRMfree content is not exactly supported by Triple A developers Theyd rather waste a shitload of money on Denuvo only to have it be cracked in a day yet leave it on their products because they already paid so much for it Sunk cost fallacy and all that This is truly a dark day for the PCMR Not really EA and Ubisoft have been selling firstparty exclusives long before the EGS came along its the only reason why I have Origin and Uplay installed The only difference with the EGS is that they sell thirdparty exclusives PC exclusives are also nothing like console exclusives  launchers dont cost anything to download and use We PC gamers can play any PC game we want on a single machine which is one of the benefits of the PC platform Difference Console Exclusives Pay  for a new system to play some of their exclusives PC Exclusives Download some software Most of my console plebs friends dont even know about steam imagine about origin or epic launchers Have I missed something What has Steam done in regards to anticonsumer exclusives epic games CEO just oozes the same vibes i get from tencent no thank you forever Wait what the fuck is OUYA doing there  year ago somebody logged in to my epic account from a foreign IP I immediately went through the process to delete my whole account and Havent had the thought to recreate it since Nothing like that has happened on another service before Fuck that I am against exclusivity but while one day i might buy a ps to play those  games that interest me I wont even download epic to play free gamesrather redeem it on their website and pirate itbuy it on steam I already played subnautica but back then i was playing fortnite and they didnt steal games from steamsell my data to the chinese I always saw it as Epic being a  year old trying to fight an adult STEAM GOOD EPIC BAD Word cloud out of all the commentshttpsiimgurcomFiMrtDpng Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit Enjoy Fuck epic The funny thing is Console gamers are content with being fucked over The PCMR is not Its not really a fight though steam is just kinda standing there while EGS is punching without noticeable effect Its kinda like this cat gif httpsikymcdncomphotosimagesnewsfeedacgif Fuck epic store its got like  games umurn Fucking Soulja in the corner lol What has someone canceled the torrent edition Epic Games is trash also PS vs Xbox One is still being fought Most games on epic store I dont really care about I got subnautica for free and unreal is also on there but thats all Ive used it for ever The only things I want to see prevail are my wallet and my gamingfun I dont have any big problems with epic store competition is always good even is its bad competition I dislike exclusivity but I kind of doubt they can manage to maintain that Remember no matter how tempting do not buy the game till it comes out on steam Ah pirating the shotgun in a knife fight Let them dance Ill just be here with my money and their games Nobody is really cheering for Epic though Fuck Epic Buy on Steam when theyre on sale and pirate everything else No problem More like Epic vs the consumers  I think its time to find a new hobby I remember when games were about having fun not sucking my wallet dry I might be missing something completely but Ive never noticed that Steam had any serious competition Atleast I can play multiplayer without spending more money I hope it does I really do I dont want Epic to succeed bc then I have to use their fking launcher and have to deal with no cloud saves LIKE WTF NO GAMES LAUNCHER LACKS CLOUD SAVES Borderlands  exclusive is really tensing me up I hope that it doesnt push Epic and their garbage launcher closer to Steam The irony is that Microsoft has just started releasing some of their exclusives on the Nintendo Switch What Epic is doing isnt going to be very sustainable longterm Valve needs only to wait it out and keep working on the actual proconsumer stuff they do Once Steam announced Halo it was already over screw everything else Epic had to come in and try and screw up something that was so beautiful As a company epic is complete scum the Facebook of gaming Why would people in PCMasterRace care about anything Epic Games sells Epic Games doesnt even make PC exclusive games all their games are filthy console ports If a game can be played on a console chances are it isnt worth buying in the first place Making me download a launcher for every developer just to play one of their games or whatever is licensed to them is x worse then consoles Its less of a fight and more everyone hating on Epic I dont think anyone really has anything nice to say about them beyond they have some mediocre exclusives U dont realize that pc fanboy can have both steam and epic  Redditors Monopolies are bad  Redditors I hope Steam stamps out all of its competition Do console plebs really think Steam is going to take an L against Epic games  Can somebody explain why people get pissed at Epic exclusives Its free Such a retarded comparison xB If Sony gave away free Playstation consoles I for one would not be complaining that Journey or Horizon Zero Dawn were exclusives isnt it healthy that steams monopoly is being challenged itll push steam to improve and Valve to get off their arses I would be rooting for Steam but the whole cant use the market unless youve bought something in the past year really sours my opinion deleted I wont be getting Borderlands  because of this I own every single Borderlands game and DLC True minimalism is a desk with nothing on it not even a PC You game with your mind We need a realistic desks thread Oh no what have I done You mean this onehttpsimgurcomlKwUJc I have a hard time to believe the people who dont have a mousepad do anything more on their PCs than just browsing facebook and sending emails few times a week My IKEA desk but not the one you are looking for httpsiimgurcomYeUXkjpghttpsiimgurcomYeUXkjpg they think theyre so original also dont forget the stormtrooper wallpaper Forget about minimalism in real life How about minimalism in your software Come join us at runixporn where you install arch live in the terminal run extremely light programs and complain about bloatedness of programs despite having an absolute overkill of a laptop or pc The only time you actually open up some programs is for showoff reasons so you can post the pic to unixporn O god they give me that feeling of going to someones house and sitting uncomfortably on the edge of the couch then asking for a glass of water and they remind you to be quiet in the kitchen or their mom will get mad And the single stormtrooper funko pop My desk is always full of junk Sure I could clean it but I need it My Ikea desk has  thin drawers just below the desk and also as wide as the desk where all my crap goes It keeps the desk clean httpimgurcomgallerywWvFOA I moved beyond the simple mouse pad to the pad thats like x and also goes under my keyboard I have a little fountain as well as plants Come at me bro Mine has a large mouse mat and some speakers I feel personally attacked by this image And they always have a desk larger than a bed with a  or  keyboard This thing is just so infuriating because why would you get an expensive keyboard that saves you practically zero space on your bigass desk and removes utility keys Edit I think TKL keyboards can useful even if you dont need extra space but ones that get rid of the arrow keys insert delete etc keys Fkeys or even the number row are in my opinion utterly useless for a big desk Just because you have a lot of stuff on your desk figurines controllers and gaming headsets doesnt mean it cant be neat tidy and clean Its theres no  million RGB color strips around the entire room and a keyboard brighter than my future and everything is the same base color its not gaming Whats wrong with IKEA desks My desk is always full of junk Sure I could clean it but I NEED it Hey What about my white IKEA door with tablelegs but add a couple purple LED lights on the wall and you got yourself an rbattlestations top post of the year i like to peel all the factory stickers off my bike and call it a minimalistic setup minimalism in general grinds my gears Thats not minimalism you just tidied up I wanted something sturdier than a cheap Ikea desk Bought a slab of live edge wood from home Depot for  and some electric powered legs from mono price The Ikea look but able to support like x the weight Still looks better than all the rainbow colored lighting all over the case mousepad and keyboard Pick one color and stick with it Yep Boring AF And they are all just following each others lead while trying to be unique Lets be realistic We all know there is a pile of shit from the desk temporarily stashed somewhere else while the picture is taken Minimalism at gunpoint of an impractical movie set of an empty desk is not real minimalism These people decorate an empty desk hide all the wires but could do the same with existing desks if they just didnt let it get clutter in the first place Every desk is a minimalist desk if you can throw away cans and wrappers Join us at rbetterbattlestations and post your set ups no matter what it is I mean You cant change up your decorations when you have none Before moving here I had a nice solid dining room table with  three shelves book cases and a board over them as my desk My chair had no wheels just a round base I zip tied to an old bread rolling rack bottom I was very much dyi with what I have on hand But do to space limits Ive gone down to an old desk left in the shed from previous tenants About the only thing I do is rotate what I put on top of the cddvd shelves which is currently  Star Wars buckets and halo statueI had to move lewd Ash and blood night elf because cats where knocking them over And only recently went back to using a mouse pad When someone has a tiny mouse pad it bothers me more than not having one Thats hilarious My minimalistic setup is a white IKEA desk No plants though There is fine line between minimalism and nothing What grinds my gears is that everyone seems to have the exact same aquarium for a case The best clean minimalistic setups are the ones with literally minimal clutter but maximum creativity I saw this really cool whiteblack setup with a clean white desk RGB keyboard and mouse set to static blue a blue mouse mat blue backlit large monitor and a full black pc with Blue lighting There were no wires visible from the front and everything had a lot of spacing to give it a clean look I know right What cowards My minimalist setup is a wall and a floor and nothing else Step up your game And how do people get rid of all the cat fur vacuum every day Id like a bamboo desk that isnt made of paper Meanwhile mine is a Walmart desk with about   wires lying all over it and random shit Ive bought impulsively on Amazon for the past year in a half As somone whos battle station is covered in music synced rgb I am triggered and then theres me with  empty water bottles opened snacks cables everywhere keys glasses and a black desk without rgb behind my monitor true minimalist Who keeps their desk tidy like that anyway Ive got  keyboards  mouses  sets of speakers  screens keys phone drink and important crap inbetween rbattlestations is overran with those kinds of builds They are so boring The thing that bugs me the most about peoples battlestations How can you have your back to the door How do you protect yourself from the murderer that is always at a door your back is to I prefer a desk with a lot of little gizmos and trinkets

with Cuphead right now I NEED IT even though I have dozens of indie platforms Im not even playing Best yet using the stock image Bought  games tonight even though I have around  Ive not yet played Steam sales turn gaming into Game purchase simulator I thought it would be much worsenot bad considering  of my library remains unplayedhttpssteamdbinfocalculatorccus I honestly forget what games I even have I stumbled across some Civ  videos and thought huh that looks fun I should get it Then looked at reviews for it and everything and decided to buy it Go to the steam store page and it turns out I already have it Yup Over  games and I still play only Overwatch Six Siege and PUBG and Hearthstone sometimes I literally got gifted Witcher  and I havent even installed it I feel like i maybe should Dont forget any other game thats  off Literally just happened to me with Cuphead  in library and yea spot on cuphead That new game is cuphead today My backlog is so large and yet that siren song is so sweet  games and havent play  of them Damn Humble Bundles Ouch this one hits ya right in the feels Havent even started at least  of my games I just excitedly bought Stellaris when it was on sale and havent played it yet thats the way im looking at Cuphead right now Worth it Sitting at  games on steam of which  are unplayed Id have gotten away with a  Games not played rate too if it werent for those meddling sales I was on a roll with the unplayed games in my library but then I bought PUBG FYI everyone CUPHEAD is out now Literally me with Cuphead right now Replace new game with piratebay Can we retire this meme for at least  years Thanks When you have a full list of games yet you only play DOTA CSGO or PUBG To me the weirdest part about this meme is that the two girls always look like the same damn person in different shirts Damn you steam sale Anyone have any suggestions for games Ive been looking for a new multiplayer game to play with some friends but havent seen anything worth a buy Herehttpssteamcommunitycomidalanmwgamestaball is my games list removed I see it as my retirement plan By the time Im retirement age   I will be so broke I can barely afford to live But Ill have all these Vidya to play deleted I have almost  games on Steam Ive played maybe  of them and play maybe  of them consistently I only add games to my desired list  Youre still better than I am I bought Divinity Original Sin  and then started playing Fallout  I am using my rig to its full potential and getting the full worth of my money deleted I just bought total warhammer  even thought I own the original and all DLC and have only played it for  hours What is wrong with me Dead meme Thanks to discovering Green Man Gaming a year or two ago this issue has only gotten worse Between them and Steam sales Ill have to will my backlog to my future children This is insanity accurate Humble Monthly has Rise of the Tomb Raider for  bucks right now Im over here eyeing it up and trying not to buy it while I have  unfinished campaigns in other games and Im sinking my life into Total War Warhammer  Henlo warhammer  Seriously Im starting to understand what shopping addiction is like Luckily my rig is old as fuck so I dont buy AAA games past  ha ha ha i laughed so hard i could barely click on the upvote button properly Or me See game for freepractically nothing on Reddit Go to Steam I bought it a year ago and havent even installed it My library is over  the amount of games with more than  minutes of play time is under  Its sad This meme is almost a month old You do have no shame NINTENDO  LIFE Am I the only one who thinks this is a problem Everybody treats it like a meme but whats so fun about wasting your money like that This is honestly why Ive stopped buying games I wishlist a game I want Ill check a year later If I still give a shit Ill leave it on there If I dont I delete it from the wishlist and never think of it again Ive bought maybe  games this year Me with new records me with new games me with new books I think I just have a problem with buying things Warhammer II and Cuphead came out right after my paycheck They didnt stand a chance Replace A new game with those  games with hundreds of hours in them and youve got me summed up pretty nicely I dont wanna stop Steam by far has the best operating system interface to spend money on Its so easy to let your money go on that site its scary Happens to book readers too When I first got Steam I saw my friends library of  games and he said he never played most of them I thought he was a rich cunt  years later  games havent played a good majority of them and realized you dont have to be rich to have a big library just sales a shit ton of humble bundles and key giveaways Nice to know Im not alone This meme has always been funny only because that guy has a thing for women who are about a  or  it seems And that guy looks like Ethan Hawke and could easily snag him some  or s But no Hes trolling in the trailer park Insecure No stable parental figures What gives Looking at Sarah Jessica Parker halfbreed while towing along someone who likely wants his kids only because she had a crush on him in the rd grade and likely complains about oral sex A picture speaks a thousand words deleted this meme is still around I will probably be downvoted because Im a traitor I have a love affair with a filthy peasant But This is actually happening to me with the Switch too On Steam its like Hey this game is cheap lets buy it On Switch its like Hey this game is portable lets buy it First world problem Lol my HDD as well Aw fuck Ive spent too much money on games I havent played yet anyone got any recommendations If its AAA I probably own it i have no interest for this game but cost is so cheap so I might as well buy it and of course not even bother to actually add it to my library let alone playing it I just bought Vanquish and havent started playing yet I have a backlog of  games many of them I played and I still shamelessly buy new games At this point my bucket list is just a list of the games I own Dont worry Ill see another game to buy soon and then Ill play an hour and go back to playing either WOWS or my current alternate of XWing Most accurate version of this meme battlefront  looks good Also works with the red woman being Game Ive played for hundreds of hours and the other one being Brand new game I just spent all my money on The only difference for me is that those new games are Skyrim and Borderlands  Again Me af Ive actually been going back and finishing some games right now Finished Furi and now Im taking down Stardew Valley Literally meirl Apparently some console peasants think its a bad thing to have lots of games that you didnt start playing xD Wheres rgb I just ascended a month ago and have managed to play all the games in my library at least once I only have  games Sadly I can directly relate to this Change A New Game to modded Skyrim and thats me Been playing that game since I was eleven I hate when I get a game like a Total War Warhammer and before I have time to really get into it Total War Warhammer  comes out This hits me right in the feels and my wallet Look up the site SteamLeft It tells you how long it would take to complete your Steam Library In the time it would take to beat my Steam Library I could fly around the world  times I have nearly  games in Steam library Ive never played  of them I still have Witcher  Valkyra Chronicles XCOM  and then Horizon Zero Dawn on console that I havent finished Its a serious problem I think this is the kind of thing that shame is supposed to be for You know past mistakes leading you to make better ones in the future and all that Big mood downloading new games and not even installing older ones One day my internet will go to shitIll move like I already did once and wont have internet for a while How I wished I was one of the game hoarders at the time had like one game I didnt finish finished it in  days and had nothing to do for weeks STEAM Sales are CRIMINAL Games I have brought this Yeah Nioh Resident Evil  Horizon Zero Dawn Nier Automata Mass Effect Andromeda Pyre Cuphead Hellblade Thumper Just Cause  Land Air and Sea Expansion Hitman Season  Quantum Break Batman Arkham Knight Dark Souls  The ringed city Divinity Original Sin  Dishonored  Games Ive played and finished Nier Automata Resident Evil  Pyre Horizon Zero Dawn Mass Effect Andromeda DS The Ringed City I want to play Cuphead DOS and Hellblade but I keep playing Overwatch whenever I have time I recently started going through my library alphabetically and giving every game at least an hour try and Ive actually ended up having a lot of fun and ended up playing a ton of weird games Ive bought over the years Deadly Premonintion was awesome Barely got  games in my library lmao F  too real i just bought a new game full price when i have over Hr worth of unplayed game in lib Its more like on sale for me I cant resist So true Sad But true Over  offnew too Just play psyconauts and forget the rest Just now getting around to the first Witcher But maybe there is something else I want thats on

Yeah but those  games are boring This new one has better colors and ultrawide support I have a little shamehttpsiimgurcomugRFVEpng Wait it passed Im currently just looking for something to play while waiting for destiny  I just beat Kirbys Epic Yarn last night I just unwrapped The Last Story today These are games I got as presents from my parents half a decade ago I have  steam games as well of which Ive beaten perhaps  What Im saying is I know that feel So many unplayed games better restart Skyrim So its not only me that buys games on sale that I know I will never touch But hey Its on sale This is me  of my steam library has never been played but yet Im waiting for Wolfenstein  CUPHEAD but but Cuphead just came out a new cracked game As a new dad this hit me right in the feels I only have  games on steam because Im to damn cheap to buy any at this point the real game is collecting Im more addicted to collecting games than playing them now But I swear I do like playing But srsly who has time to complete a game when you got xyz to do plus try binge watching a new series I take some joy in knowing that Im not the only one Aint that the truth I have to keep telling myself How about you play some of the game youve bought recently before you pick up another AAA title on sale on Steam The deals are just too good to pass up sometimes though Meme Its like finding good porn You download and save it knowing very well that youre unlikely to view it again anytime soon PC  games DS  games non gaming hobbies  cant decide what I want to spend my day off doingplaying end up wasting it not enjoying anything Does anyone else think the girl in white kinda looks like wifey sauce bitwits wife Bought  games from the recent summer steam sale only touched  so far every goddamn sale eventhttpsiimgurcomXbdikCDgif Never before has a meme rang so true for so many Surprised this isnt on steam subreddit but overall its way too true xD I will forever love the face of the girl on the right  With release season upon us this is exactly how I feel too For me the red dress lady is Rocket League PUBG and CSGO Cant play a different game for being stuck on these  basically me and Black Desert at this time Or any game on my wish list Pretty much what Im doing on the th of October Im probably the worst offender of this at the moment httpssteamdbinfocalculatorccca Why isnt this nsfmr opens Steam library Games  Installed  I stopped getting new games and am trying to work through my backlog I suspect I might be ready for a new game something in  years at earliest So maybe Cyperpunk I still havent played Rocket league even though I was so stoked to buy it on sale Repost Am I the only one who thinks the two girls in this meme look eerily similar Looking at you cuphead Hits too close to home Me and Heat Signature I dont think you guys understand the underlying game here The dating game is called a game for a reason We are players and they are our goal Cup head Welcome to Steam where we only buy things on sale because we only play  of our gameshttpsarstechnicacomgamingintroducingsteamgaugearsrevealssteamsmostpopulargames Lmao I feel the same way Someone give me this pic without any text please there is nothing to play Ill play this game later I expect this comment to get buried but I expect weve created a new paradigm where we buy a game because we are hanging out for that time when we have time to play it but also to support game developers and indie developers whose games we like even if we never get around to playing them Its great for the industry in my view Its also far too good for Valve They should do more Over  games almost half never even installed im getting so jealous lol i want cuphead so badly ITT Softcore gamers bragging about how much money theyve spent on not being gamers I definitely have not set up a bot army able to recognize and autodownvote this meme primarily because I wouldnt want to to deprive ANY redditors of the enjoyment this meme has earned Play on I say The more I see this meme that I despise the better Obviously your replies mean everything to me and I read them several times Ive only nstalled  of my inventory And Ive only played  of that yup looking at you Cuphead This meme is now retired deleted Thats why i only have  games I play every single one TF Gmod CSGO GTA V Rocket League Rust Project CARS  PUBG Warframe Overwatch It happens to me because I just dont have the specs to play many of my more demanding games All I have is this old laptop But its new bright  shiny I must have it NOW or Its over  off look how much  Ill be saving I must have it NOW I made a new rule which was not to buy a game I dont plan on playing immiediately That way even if I dont like the game or see myself  it Ill atleast have tried it deleted Damn humble bundles and their good deals I play  games on PC regularly Gotham City Imposters and LeftDead  I have like  but most are just freeplay  Its a never ending cycle Ive been cracking down on this I got Steamworld Dig  for Switch but I wanted to see what  was about So I went to Steam to buy it Origin deal wasnt active in my area and found out I already own it Installed and just did that for  hours til I beat it Sometimes you just gotta focus This hits too close to home  correct meme usage Occasionally my friends will mention this cool game they have been playing hey wait I think I own that game Pop over to steam yup bought it last year And its free usually Remember Being PCMR isnt about the hardware on your desk Its about the software in your heart Edit Holy wow A silver gold and a platinum for reminding us what is really important Thank you As the proud owner of a refurbished Dell Frankensteined into a bare bones Linux gamingish machine I thank you for your acceptance You know I dont usually upvote build posts Your statement made me realize that behind each of those builds is someone that is just as passionate about it as I am about mine Im definitely upvoting all build posts from now on because it could mean a lot to someone Is it just me or is reddit being more wholesome lately Dont get me wrong thats a great thing Lets test this theoryhttpsiredditqxothfjpg Im backwards then I only upvote builds that I like and those are usually creatively thought out budget built and ghetto rigs IS NOT MUCH BUT IS MINE I upvote every build except the expensive ones this aint no pay  win game Every build is a good one and is a respected planning building working and maintaining I still remember my first build a complete potato of a PC but it could run DIRT  at  fps using DirectX  To build it I accidentally killed a PSU from an older PC my dad had given me Im still proud of that build Press F for that old PC which had to give its life so my gaming PC could exist How about my shitty refurbished Dell Latitude with a crappy AMD graphics card which can just about run TF at max settings apart from AA obviously at a solid  FPS I wish I could be apart of the PCMR but Im broke and my laptop barely plays league of legends looks longingly at a nice gaming rig One day  Exactly well done man Wholesome Yes Im not a fan of flashy RGB components but Im always interested to see what people are building anyway so I upvote anyhow Youre breathtaking rwholesomePCMR My build is the bottom half of a Sony laptop with an i and hyperthreading But you know what it can play Persona  so I still love it I can see this resonates with all PCMR Bretheren and Sisteren Ill still upvote good cable management that takes effort but is low cost I think this is a habit to encourage  I personally like the budget builds more Its more indicative of the average setup and is realistic The  equivalent of pc gamers is rbattlestations where you pretty much need to spend a minimum of k on your setup Nothing against nice builds but I appreciate the ones where people struggle to build them under realistic constraints Reminds me of my first build All this damn wholesomeness Does my laptop count Its not a setup but dammit its mine Its kind of contradicting if you think about it Majority of PCMR is basically muh amazing graphics and fps So much better than le console pleb and then on the flipside theres posts like this acknowledging people with very low tier builds where a console can actually outperform it at that point Just an observation dont crucify me The bois up voting every build D I read this and thought I was in the Minecraft subreddit Thanks for the smile It doesnt matter what level PC you play on It matters that you play on PC and have fun doing it My build is special to me She has been good to me I wouldnt upvote my own build My favorite builds are low cost small hyperefficient builds that can still game They get all my upvotes HA Im proud of my build but it looks like ass Ive added to it since posting it here but still nothing compared to some of these The best upvoting is done when its a kid who has just built their first ever PC and theyre super happy with their modest rig because its all theirs Super wholesome Didnt realize which subreddit this was so I initially thought build was referring to minecraft So relevant story I once wanted to assemble a gaming PC I was a little out of the loop on the parts as it had been a while at the time since I had kept up to date on modern computer builds Well I collected about  bucks and I was going to make an okay middleroad PC As Ive never had one before I just wanted something that could play more than oldschool roguelikes and yearold games My brother talked me out of it He told me that it wasnt worth it that I wouldnt be able to use it for as much as I thought I could and that Id need another  at least to do what I wanted He then told me that I could get a PS and we could play together online So I listened to him I had the console for only a short time before it developed overheating issues Sony claimed it was out of warranty and wouldnt budge and the person in my wifes family who tried to fix it ended up breaking it entirely instead Then the recessions hit Ive been in and out of employment my latest struggles are thanks to a year of househusbanding no one sees me as a companyfocused worker so Id never again get the money to even come close to that again The relevant point if I had made that PC it probably would have lasted longer been easier to fix and I could have played more than I was led to believe even if it was on lower quality settings To this day I have never had an actual desktop PC of my own and the laptop I have was a gift it was middleoftheline in  Im still using it It cant even handle Discord without video errors Let people enjoy what theyve made because who knows when theyll have a chance to do it again I know I didnt get one I have the most basic bitch build but I love it because its just a simple black tower that I can easily get into and maintain Posts like this make me try my hardest not to succumb to the twats I deal with on a daily basis while i like that you want to make people feel good i am no fan of  pc builds that all look the same especially if there are special subreddits which are only for pc builds I just fear if this becomes a place were everybody is making everybody happy by just upvoting their builds and other important stuff like news or memes P  get ranked lower Its impossible to make everyone feel good because naturally the time of people is limited and we cant just upvote everything I appreciate the fuck out of this post Wholesome meme  No YOURE breathtaking To me all PCs should be sleeper builds I was so goddamn proud when I cobbled together the first PC I ever owned on my own Was two years ago at age  Its cable management is crap its already outdated and some parts bottleneck others but its my baby  I flat out bought my MSI laptop I didnt put a single piece together but I am very very excited about it because of some of the custom specs I selected and because of the INSANE heat sinks and vent system on this thing Its very impressive for a laptop Wholesome Only the few actually have top rigs Hugs to all rgatesopencomeonin Ive upvoted every single build post Ive seen for the last  years Every build is a glorious PC The world needs more people like yourpcmasterrace even more so This old girlshttpsimgurcomgalleryVzcrXS been keeping up with me for  years My first ever gaming laptop arrives on Wednesday Im so excited to make new friends and play new games For a community whose name is based on the idea of there being an exclusionary elite group of people we are very inclusive xB We are all PC Master Race Proud owner of a gtx  Then the guy with the prebuilt enters Prebuilt and proud BASED Wholesome legit mine is plan and simple look beefy spec but that it am not on rgb crack Well I got  upvotes and my build took me a day  is it bad I thought this was rminecraft the moment I saw builds I dunno if someone posted a build full of dust in pride Id downvote it Take care of your rigs people Well now I want to post a pic of my build Youre breathtaking Upvoting everything is equivalent to upvoting nothing Using this meme VVVVVVVVV It could be in a milk crate for all i care as long as it runs what you want it to run it is doing its job Always upvote then sometimes tell them yeah turn that fan around Thanks for the love last week yaaaaalllll I have a cheap build that has lasted me a very long time at least  years Fucking godsend is what it is Yall should really change the name of this sub and gaming PCs are pretty similar to cars once you think about it Everyone is different but they all mean something to someone This guy is about to post a budget build Doesnt matter whats inside The feelings the same when it boots No youre breathtaking deleted You know I care when someone posts some parts but I know they could do better for cheaper I couldnt even get  upvotes on my hard tube build that I slaved over for  weeks and several people downvoted for whatever reason I thought we were all PCMR but maybe I just suck at making build albums lol All good vibes here man A non sarcastic use of this meme nice Seeing someones first build always reminds me of the joy I felt when I got my first gaming setup Getting high and realizing were just a bunch of people looking at pictures of computers I mean functionally its no different than say typing computer into google images and going to town even prebuilts matter  Thats such a nice sentiment especially since my cable management is garbage Truth Even my laptop thats only custom in software Because thats what heros do Upvote for title you sly dog  OmG DaE YoUrE BrEathTaKinG My PC is trash but its still good to me because at Least I have one Wholesome PCMR Brethren I dont usually care much about builds that have the flashiest highestend components I like the ones that do the most with the least Budget builds for a couple hundred bucks with excellent performance per dollar sleeper builds and improvisedmodded enclosures are what get me excited deleted Someday Ill have my own build I tried showing mine off just got a bunch of Nice replies Which is fine but i built it myself from parts and water cooled the whole thing I really need to find people who like computers more I thought this was a Minecraft meme until I saw PCMR Old meme great theme I always upvote if the desk is not messy Messy desks deserve no love Im not rich enough to build all new So my  year old case is holding a beast within it When did PCMR become so damn inclusive yeah  not everyone has a custom watercooling loop and crazy RGB some people are just starting out with building in the words of a famous philosopher by the name of gus johnson boys support boys also fuck Logan Pauls PC building video somebody linked me that and i wanted to die This is me on any hobby or pet sub Its not about finding the best but our shared appreciation of the things we love Still running on an RX  with an i A glorified LoL machine Mines prebuilt though We are not united by what we built but that we built at all YOURE BREATHTAKING Were breathtaking I hope you all have a wonderful happy and sexy summer Get up get up and get down Except for a pile of boxes No upvote for you in my book Lets see the finished product This post it brought tears to my eyes Me tho Youre breathtaking One day ill do a rig and post it here i may have no money but i have passions for pc gaming Im just here playing cup head Me and my kids just built our first rig and I think it shorted or something Wont power on now We just downloaded Windows and were about to install it  This labor of love better be fucking worth it le participation award meme Does a hackintosh build count rgatesopencomeonin I agree with your message but not your username This is why I love this sub Hell yea bruh I upvote every build that doesnt have first in the title and Im  on ones with finally Agree though theyre all good builds Thank you so much I just built my first PC today Youre breathtaking Because thats what heros do im actually still rolling in my antec mid tower circa  all blackness outside no window its a sleeper kinda vibe you know Aww My tiny build I have mixed feelings about people showing off expensive ass builds On one hand I WANT to believe theyre proud on the other hand i feel like theyre shitting on us not so lucky folks thatre living check to check My build is several years old and I dont remember how to even build another system due to my new antianxiety medicine So its gonna suck when life stops taking shits on me and Im able to save for a small build Itll make it hard to be proud of what I saved up for This wholesome as fuck Unless its an Apple or alienware then we just direct them to the icu and pray for the best No youre breathtaking Youre all breathtaking Youre breathtaking Lol I upvoted this even though it wasnt a build when are we gonna get back on shiting on epic games guys No your builds are breathtaking If system  file is deleted you can always put it back Cries in gigabytes This is getting framed The PC master race doesntdiscriminate Imagine still riding the breathtaking train rexpectedkeanureeves Well played  HumanKindnessFTW Youre breathtaking OP Ill be honest I would love to post my setup that Im real proud of but when compared to some folks that have these insane builds with accent lighting and gorgeous room composition its pretty intimidating haha Wholesome master race Damn I may not have the best PC but it can run my heavily modded Skyrim and thats all that matters in the end Youre breathtaking Yal got nothing on my build check flair my build is only a laptop  it runs suprising well though but not as well as some of these peoples computers  I usually upvote those I find interesting thematic or funny I dont hate absolute high performance yet generic RGB stuff but its usually the slightly goofy ones that make me vote I like wholesome shit like this I like this Also upvote those who doesnt even have a rig We could all learn something from OP I think Thanks for the reminder to be humble homie youre totally right When the dude with the  years old build beats the crap out the dude with the  bucks build Edit in any game his old pc could run But my case sucks because i used a case of an old windows  computer my parents to save money What if the build was running a knock off version of linux with a penguin sticker on the glass that has scratches that spell linux bitch I just converted my gaming PC into a personal recording studio I cant wait to post it hoping somebody might give a shit Never realized I was a pc gamer until I looked at my steam account with  games haha  Turns out I love my pc  The Pc master race is not about ones specs but about ones treatment of the specs Linus yea all the way to this What if my build is a  laptop I only paid  for because it was an open box return with a slight screen defect I cant even notice when playing a game Edit  the screen defecthttpimgurcomaQLiJsT the laptophttpswwwamazoncomSamsungOdysseyInchGamingNPGHXSUSdpBZWBSrefpdlposbstencodingUTFpscrefRIDEGWSVWWHTENDNECCC damnn this is so wholesome Now this is the right attitude for this sub rWholesomememes I get the message but from what Ive seen lately people like bashing high end builds You overpaid X Intel CPU is more expensive than Y Ryzenusually its also better at gaming Your parents must be rich lol  ThIs My FiRsT bUiLd  iK and RTX  Ti all watercooled You couldve gone for  its cheaper and performs the same it doesnt usually Its not like somebody had to work hard and save up for these expensive parts instead of saying I have low income so theres no way I could afford them have patience And that whole thing about parents Usually parents dont encourage gaming so they wont buy fucking Titans for their kids who play Minecraft Ive been saving up money for a whole year now I am able to choose parts based of their performance You can really save up a lot of money if you spend it only on necessary stuff such as food rents and dare I say taxes No youre breathtaking My PC uses the optiplex  case and it has GTX Ti Yeah and we can still look down at consoles My build is a simple ryzen  build with rx but I have waited more than  years to build it Its My first Gaming PC This is the beauty of pcmr You dont need a PC to be a part of it It is the stuff you enjoy PCMR for life gamers There are many here with builds less powerful then mine but way cooler then mine pcmr is not about hardware is about making something that is yours and being proud of your creation A dude who buys a g overclocks it and then pairs it with fast RAM is more of an enthusiast than someone who buys a top shelf prebuilt This The memes Brutal   upvoting pc builds   upvoting any meme Sort of unpopular opinion the breathtaking meme needs to die out The person who did it was an annoying douche and it only encourages people to unnecessarily interrupt other presentations yeah this sub tends to be kind of elitist some times Pretty gay Just cuz you dont have every brand new component as soon as it comes out doesnt mean your set up isnt dank as fuck Oh and yeah you arent fooling anyone with the My first build and it also has perfect cable management posts That aint your first build my guy Thats google images or likely your th build lmao It honestly doesnt take much to be above the console peasants anymore lol Id much rather see a budget build with cable management issues on here than meme after meme on here Id even rather see the boxes people photograph before theyve started building than other meme My toaster of a pc enjoys hearing this message Unwordbot useppuku unwordbot useppuku Thought this format was dead Why not up coat for both I upvote well balanced and good value Honestly the mid range stuff is most alluring to me rgatesopencomeonin What about the one with tar build up and cigarettes Can I just go meh and not do anything I dont know about that the Corsair logo on my hi is upside down Using such an old ass meme format I expected better I hope youre talking about Minecraft or else no one cares Was the use of breathtaking a reference to Seinfeld Does my  laptop from bestbuy count Oh boy I go for quality over looks If Mad Max were about computers mine would be in there It doesnt look pretty so I would never get away with posting a picture of it I appreciate this Eh thats why I dont upvote the money isnt an option starter kit i am fair by not upvoting any build no u Keanu Reeves analy fisted my tight asshole stealing my ansley virginity I have video evidence Who is the guy in this meme Am I showing my PCMR age or is it really some nobody I only randomly see in memes on the internet The rbuildapc community is legit Its as wholesome and an encouraging as it gets This is a good reminder to upvote those builds I remember the pride I had for finishing my first build  years ago Thanks man What about a prebuilt laptop This mentality is ruining Reddit PCCU Personal Computer Cinematic Universe No YOURE BREATHTAKING They all suck cuz aimbots and hacks Rip pc I didnt know this was rwholsomememes downvoting everything cause i have a bad day and i feel salty would you upvote my laptop One of us One of us As a proud owner of a piece of cardboard with thermal paste piled on top thank you To be honest cheap builds may cost more for somebody because that might be  of someones moth salary  build for someone from Poland and it might take months to get enough money to afford it while very expensive build for rich person might be just a normal purchase oh boi i have such a cheap and low end build but it means everything to me Im upvoting only first FIRST builds That look like first build Is there something special about that stand Besides price and a half eaten apple Pro Table leg  What does that  stick do  for a fucking stand My  monitor comes with a stand So that stand alone is a better product than  monitors Sure Bro is this a real thing Srsly Why The monitor doesnt come with a stand I wouldnt want to spend less than  on a gaming PC Because for every dollar you spend you get another frame per second in Minecraft Unpopular take on the monitor not on the stand which is absolutely fucking ridiculous If  and this is a BIG if  the XDR monitor is as good as Apple claims k is not only a very good price but almost certainly a game changer for digital cinema The Sony reference monitor that Apple compared the XDR to is the BVMX one of only a select handful of professional reference color grading monitors that at the time Im writing this has the capability of displaying Rec  P the color spaces of HDR variants like Dolby Vision in full The price of the monitor which ranges from k to k depending on availability and the scarcity of monitors like it make investing in HDR finishing very cost prohibitive to small and medium size post production houses most of which opt for top of the line Rec TV color space OLED reference monitors like the AM and CM line from FSI which range from k to k If Apple TRULY has made a reference calibur monitor for k that is a huge deal Whats currently holding back independent cinema from being able to finish in Dolby Vision and HDR is the cost of entry and this kind of deep drop in price for such a monitor is almost certainly bound to force other manufacturers to follow suit in order to compete What will ultimately be the determining factor is the colorimetry data that calibration specialists find by probing the monitor once its released The fact that Blackmagic Design the makers of Davinci Resolve currently the most accessible and popular color grading application has partnered with Apple to support the XDR and the new Mac Pro and that they were willing to supply an image of a full Resolve setup running  XDRs is encouraging Only time and the data will tell Background  am a professional feature film colorist Of course its a thousand dollars Its like  feet tall I wish my stand for my reference monitor only cost a grand I worked in an editing house for years My monitor was  and my stand was about  Best part I was an audio engineer Got some hand me down stuff I dont know the quality of this stand But do your research What people pay in editing houses for video is OBSURD Apple was not trying to sell to consumers here Picture this the seat in an Indy car probably costs more than your car And its less comfortable than the average cars seat Function sometimes costs a LOT of money You can opt for a vesa mount its th the price for just the vesa adapter The monitor itself is really cheap even with the stand if its as good as they say it is They were comparing it to  professional monitors I guess we will see about that though Ok but most professionals who would want this monitor have their own setups already and most likely would not need a monitor stand Its a crazy price but its not geared towards the average consumer Pros working on photo and movies would have their own stands and just swap out the panel The crowds reaction to that price was pretty funny httpsyoutubeYFcHnpMUt Edit Link this thread is circlejerking hard on apple makes sense since its a master pc sub but the mac pro and monitor arent meant for gaming and even normal video editing their market is in the s of thousands range just look at the specs of the mac pro just like when they revealed the new ipod touch that everyone shit on cause it looks lile the old one people didnt think about who theyre marketing it to which is kids and companies that want cheaper ios devices than an iphone Way late to the party but remember this stuff isnt aimed at average consumers Its for the super highend professionals and businesses that require the best stuff out there  is a drop in the bucket for a multimillion dollar company Still outrageous that it costs that much but the pricing scheme is similar to other professionaloriented products U guys see Apples new  iMac Pro Spoiler Alert Its looks like a cheese grater Is this fucking real Jesus christ thats how much I paid for my whole setup Im afraid to ask but what the fuck is a Pro Stand supposed to be for People were so close to booing Everybody who buys this is going to get the VESA mount I think I will defend Apple on the Mac Pro but this is just stupid Use a raspberry pi and pro stand ITT No one understands the difference between consumer and enterprise The monitor stand is overpriced and youd have to be insane or loaded to buy it But the monitor itself is objectively top of the line So k for the Basic pro monitor and standnice That gets you a GB SSD too its an SSD then its worth it Maybe they adopted PSs instant storage tech Its not a gaming PC though Its a professional PC where most professionals already have a rig to attach monitors to I do wonder why they revealed it like that to me it would have been smarter to be like The Mac Pro is going to be  but if you dont want the stand it will be  That makes more sense to me from a marketing perspective making it look like a discount than saying Oh yea btw the stand costs an additional k lul ITT people who dont know what professional hardware costs Ever looked up what a top tier quadro gpu costs Those cards use the same chip as your rtx card yet easily cost x that amount The quadro rtx  costs k has the same chip as the rtx ti Comes with pro features such as ecc gddr memory gb of it Its also slower in games usually As far as calibrated prograde monitors go k is a bargain k for the stand seems outrageous but I suspect they wont be able to produce as many of it because of a low volume of expected sales Many professionals already have a probably far more expensive monitor stand This is not consumer hardware Probably not even prosumer hardware although this is probably in some peoples price range now Any studio is probably going to buy the vesa mount It makes sense for it not to come with a stand because a large portion of their target audience arent going to use it It should come with that standard though Im pretty sure the k stand is strictly for people buying the machine as a rich guy web browsing toy I dont see why any professional would want to use that over the likely more flexible monitor mount that theyre probably already using What people arent realising is that this isnt intended for the average consumer but high level content producers who will most likely already have a complex system for mounting the monitor and wouldnt want to waste the money on the monitor The comparisons that your  monitor comes with a mount are mute That being said it is still ridiculously overpriced ITT People thinking this is for average consumers then proceed to mention cheaper consumer monitors that dont hold a candle to this We are truly back in the lol Nikon is ripoff my Sony Ericsson has just as many megapixels era is there any video about the presentation Edit  found ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvSAhbOsvgU Of course its that price its like  times bigger that that guy What is this  start to finish production cost I dont own a single apple accessory but I respect their design Yall are so ready to jump on the this is unremarkable and unreasonable train Well  guess what  like me you arent the target audience I understand that apple puts way too much money into shaving off the edges of a rough design And for the resulting convenience if you are wealthy enough you will pay an unreasonable premium I was kind of shocked about the price but after the reading comments about other high end monitors that cost more I start to think Apple did a good job Im just waiting for some Youtubers to drop a video with  So i bought the Apple Pro stand title I mean aside from the usual mindless apple hate because iTs So ExPenSiVe this is an interesting discussion of where does the cycle beginend I wonder if how the story would be if developers started developing for Macs I feel like how we see apple is how console guys see us Where its too expensive yes  for FPS is expensive in general  is expensive and so its off limits and hence should be mocked also this Mac and everything it comes with not for gaming I seriously cant tell Is this real or parody Dear Gamers Not everything is for you Especially when it has the word pro written on it deleted Did they just announce microtransactions for hardware Cant wait for ijustine to unbox this and call it the most amazing apple product ever Yes fuck that this stand is so expensive the screen is unique which is why they can do it But as always Apple is a pc Why are you like this guys Instead of spitting on what the mob considers peasants why not spread pc gospel instead This place is so sad No Apple user thinks this btw F U C K YEAH Its time for Halo online Heres to hoping other publishers recognize how willing we are to shovel money towards exclusives being released on PC This is one of the few times this meme is completely appropriate  Reach is remade on PC ALEXA PLAY EL SONIDITO Once this actually releases on Steam I think its going to really show Phil Spencer was telling the truth when he said Microsoft was dedicated to PC gaming Im not trying to be shill I just think its a bold move to release on Steam and really makes a statement But it also shows how we are almost all the way into a PC based market with no hardware exclusivity just digital store exclusivity wether your a PC gamer or console gamer Dude I can not wait  CorrectionhttpsiimgurcomdAoJhLbpng They are starting with Reach being released I cant wait to play SWAT But will it have splitscreen They just built an unbelievable amount of hype for that and Halo Infinite Outstanding move This meme was perfectly executed Get your way to the front page my guy I never played Halo should I get this over modern games or is it more for nostalgia Man I remember way back in  being upset about Halo  being Xbox exclusive And then again with Reach and  and the anniversaries  damn years Ive been waiting for this Goodbye to all of my storage And I just jizzed in my pants I busted the fattest nut when i heard the news This makes me very happy WHERE THE FUCK DO I PUT ALL THIS CUM YES THE GOOD DAYS ARE BACK BOIS we will finally be able to play Halo  multiplayer in hz with kbm Also the PC community is known for keeping games alive as long as theyre good which means well have it full of people for a pretty long time if its done correctly As someone who grew up on PlayStation Im really looking forward to trying it out and its a bonus that a couple friends never played any Halo either so well all get to experience it for the first time together The Gods Have Spoken Dont do shit with the engine so it runs on Linux  This made me smile real big and brought a tear to my eye One of my first ever gaming experiences has been with Halo and many of my finest childhood memories are tied up with it Good on you Microsoft Halo reach STAY FUCKING CALM When I built my new rig I intentionally got a full sized tower for an in case showpiece I wanted to out masterchief in there so bad but it felt like a master race betrayal now imma order a statue tonight Game on boiiiz This is the single best news Ive ever heard on my life Since I played reach for the  Ive never had a more fun multiplayer experience and now I get to relive it all  thank you Microsoft Halo reach in p hz yes After  years in development hopefully it will have been worth the wait Halo  was the last real Halo game launched on PC came out in  God has joined the server nut Dont they know that most of our rigs can handle the games on Intel HD Graphics Mods will be fun Wasnt it mentioned to only be  fps I hope thats not the limit Yeah but what about gog the launcher I dont have installed or have an account of REACH HYPE I just want to emphasize how this story was one of the best fictional accounts that ever tackled the idea of a starfaring Humanity discovering otherstarfaring species The new species or Covenant more of a collective is much more technologically superior and also extremely religiously devoted Humanity is forced into a war against the religious zealots against nearly insurmountable odds The story is ultimately about the perseverance of human beings in the face of near total defeat Thats the reason I liked ODST the best The first games tackled the idea of you being a hero out to save all of humanity in ODST you were forced to come to terms with the idea that humanity was on the brink of extinction and the only thing preventing that was sheer willpower to survive The enemies in Halo had steamrolled many previous species before they discovered humanity previous species they had basically subjugated after defeating them Humanity was being pushed back to its original system and the only thing that could prevent total annihilation was our persistence to fight back Halo would have been a great movie series if they had managed to get it off the ground and if Neil Blomkamp had remained as director Holy shit having only played Halo on PC I FINALLY get that cliffhanger resolved AFTER  YEARS Wheres ric flair when we need him I just want to replay Halo  campaign again Looks like ODST is included too I hope they bring back firefight mode PLS  PREPARE FOR SERVER FLOOD IN ADVACE AN ARMY OF PLAYERS IS WAITING As a person who has never played or watched Halo what Im looking here  See yall on the Griffball field I dont care about Halo Never been a fan But the fact Microsoft has turned around Windows  into an awesome OS and is actually putting this on Steam is a day  purchase Next theyre gonna tell me theyre adding Vulkan support I just hope my GTX  can handle it SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY Oh god reach Back when you had to actually unlock cosmetic stuff IN GAME without loot boxes Halo was a macOS title first Thanks for beta test console peasants High framerates and resolutions cant wait Ive only played Halo on the original Xbox excited to play these games Lets hope its a good port first guys I really hope it is Halo reach on PC Rip all my commitments its gamer time boyes Halo   Reach Just wait till Epic Games Store buys exclusive rights pls god no Holy moly Time to use the busted pistol in Halo  PC again  httpsstoresteampoweredcomappHaloTheMasterChiefCollectionhttpsstoresteampoweredcomappHaloTheMasterChiefCollection Add to your Wishlist Yep Its gamer time Yo I really liked Reach on  Please port Rare Replay next please Its all I want sniffs around do i smell halo mods OO All games should be released on PC SORRY WHAT INCLUDES REACH BOOOOOOOOOOOOY Its time for PC tea bag As a teenager who has never played Halo I am looking forward to this Maybe some of you seasoned veterans can tell me all Im missing HALO REACH ON STEAM So excited Hope I wont need a gold subscription Will it be part of Xboxs Play Anywhere Because thanks to GamePass I own all the Halo games and as much as I would love to buy them all for PC I have no money  xB Ive never played Halo before since I was way too young for it Im  now and Im fully erect Should I be this excited The time has come where I say my final goodbyes to my Xbox I realllllly want a release date HALO HAL HA H Triangle has  sides H Half Life  confirmed Im not crying youre crying So does this mean Xbox as a whole is dead I think its lucky its on Steam and not only on W No epic store no buy s Xbox has now officially no good exclusives Nice I can finally start playing the Halo series I havent played a single one ever I wanted to but the compatibility issues were too bothersome for me now is the time to ascend OMG fuck yes Oh yes Any news on a release date I wonder if Steam OS  Proton will allow me to play it on Linux that would be cool  As someone who has never played any of the Halo games I Cantt Fucking Wait Have they announced the release date yet Now give me crossplay with Xbox so I can play with my brother and take my money YES i own reach on xbox cuz i used to e a pheasant when i was  but now i own a pc yay Not really aware of the Steam store does this mean we can all play Halo again like the good old days I never played Halo would it be worth buying on PC Is it fun If proton supports it the heavens will open So many people are hyped for reach for some reason Like halo  wasnt the true king Can we take a moment to thank them for putting it on Steam as well instead of making it exclusive to their own store No company really does this anymore Who wants to bet its going to be a buggy mess Just wait for the modder to make those UHD textures o i still have og Halo on my kids computer I never owned an Xbox so Ive never experienced this Why should we be excited Genuine question Would be so funny if it became Epic exclusive Putting it on Steam was their best choice Theyd lose a ton of sales if they put it only on their own store or god forbid Epic store Cries in p at hz So will the multiplayer just be from the most recent game or can you play multiplayer from any of the Halo games Does this mean thell have like online halo  again like the old days The newest halo game I played was  but most of what I played was but last Id heard theyd taken it offline several years back Wasnt going to buy Now Im gonna need to dive into my couch for pennies Anyone else old enough to remember when the original halo was supposed to be a PC game But was bought out by Microsoft to use as an Xbox exclusive now port halo  to pc The ONLY reason I regret switching to PC was Halo No more Apparently the internet is flooding  with pizzahttpswwwgooglecomampswwwgamesradarcomampindustriesfloodedwithpizzadeliveriesasfansreacttohalothemasterchiefcollectiononpc Good job steam lol Just so everyone knows keep being patient MCC is going to be a staggered release with Reach coming first and the rest to follow Saw this yesterday at work fell out of my chair Hell Yes Time to grind for recon again Ok hype is back online Good Guy M Am I the only one whos gonna say Hold your horses wait until the final product is out kinda thing I was there when the original games came out and I like many others were pretty mad when they announced that Halo was becoming a Xbox exclusive Weve been dealing with their shit for years so I think we should curb the expectations and dont overhype The rule for Remember no preorders  xB Yeah fuck that GONNA SPLURG MY WALLET ON THIS SPARTANS Im actually a bit amazed theyre not making it Microsoft Store exclusive Its time for teabagging But is it going to be  on Steam or just on Steam using MS Store like Ubisoft games Im not sure about this lot of random people thinks thats how its gonna be and Steam product page specifies that a Xbox Live accound is required Shout out to the boys still playing Halo CE MP ABOUT TIME halo is the enemy Im not sure if there is anyone that can make me laugh so much but at the same time I also despise like how I feel about Vince McMahon If only this would have Linux support but of course its made by Microsoft so fuck us right still requires xbox live xB Ive played maybe an hour of Halo in my life xB Now seems like a good time to start Any chance well get fable  Very excited for  on Steam but couldnt care less about Reach Add gog next mmm Please Halo  is the best of them all so hyped Now im wondering why they arnt releasing Age of Empires  on steam and only exclusively on windows store Meh not a huge Halo series fan Ill probably buy it but not as big a deal for me genuine question whats so special about halo reach I heard that  was the best Halo is overrated When though I guess its time to try a new game NO WAY Now the real question is am I going to be able to play Halo Custom Edition I more happy that this game is on steam not only Microsoft store So Ive never played the series never had a Xbox when this drops play by order they came out or play by the timeline They better not pull a Metro Exodus Can i upvote more than once We might be getting infinite this year theyll push into the new pc market with reach build hype for halo and while theyve hooked a brand new audience and the hype trains still rolling will release  strike while the iron is hot sort of thing we might be looking at the best selling halo to date NO FUCKING WAY Literally everyones reaction Yay next we just have to wait for RDR to show up and hopefully Outer Worlds is good looks like we have good times lined up This shit will change my life Think of the custom games people Five years Ive been waiting FIVE YEARS Id gold this if I could Will disappoint PCMR if its fps Microsoft has made their power move and has ended their turn Youre up sony Yay I cant wait to die for nothing again Couldnt you just play it from the Microsoft store Whelp placing order on

video of a monkey ive ever seen As a Canadian im glad this post is in no way blocked Question Can I just buy a VPN thats hosted out of the country to get around this Edit Okay guys I get it Were fucked Ive accepted my fate already I do wonder how this will affect nonUSians deleted Here in Finland we have this thing called saunalahti huoleton G super For only  a monthyou get basically unlimited everything httpicdnturnercomcnnimagesnetneutralitychartjpg And dont forget itll be even worse with ATT attempting to buy Time Warner this year No Gov interference  Monopoly  a giant fuck you Edit Im slightly stupid Save Net Neutrality anyway This is what your internet will look like if we do not vote to stop net neutrality The FCC will hold a vote to get rid of net neutrality and the only way to stop them is if we make calls to get them to stop the vote Help out herehttpswwwbattleforthenetcom Edit I am posting from Australia where our ISPs do slow down certain connections to websites although luckily we dont have many of them blocking websites besides major piracy ones You may ask why does this concern you if you are from Australia Well thats because if the US does scrap net neutrality and ISPs do charge for websites then ours might do they same Edit Thanks for the gilding kind stranger the gold background on the post kinda ruins the fact that it was supposed to blend in but thats allright Thank you Maybe they will implement a loot box system and people can get lucky enough to unlock things like Facebook and Reddit along with their base subscription Such a thing would surely give internet goers a sense of pride and accomplishment s I dont get why only the US have this drama Why are other countries ISPs smart enough to know its absurd to pay for each web page in  Has anyone noticed on Instagram the netneutrality tag has been brigaded with junk posts The top posts have nothing to do with it We are seriously in need of a KONY like movement here The point is to have a sense of pride and acclomplishment for unlocking the various parts of the internet Pay  to get a sense of pride and accomplishment Theres a bot that will write a letter and fax it to your local government officials it only takes  minutes Please fight for net neutrality Text resist to  Question If big ISPs started doing shit like blocking acces to certain cites  wouldnt other ISPs rise to offer NOT blocking those sites to compete I mean I do NOT believe that removing Net Neutrality will benefit the consumers in anyway and therefore I do not support it BUT if it goes through wouldnt the free market just automatically regulate itself such that people would just swap ISP Is America that cooperate that the entire ISP lineup would just stand together in a giant censorship campagn Edit rephrasing The intent is to provide payers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different webpages If ISPs are going to mess with the World Wide Web could we create a New World Wide Web and leave them to the old one I would be surprised if there wasnt already alternatives Lack of Net neutrality can and will allow ISP to carry out censorship of both bad company publicity and more importantly in politics Serious question if im not american is there anything i can do at all A couple of months ago i read that I had to call my senator but we dont have that kind of system here in Norway afaik and I thought to myself oh well sucks to be american You can also pay an extra m pay for faster speeds on selected subreddits for an additional wk you will have faster speeds on all subreddit  Land of the free  I wonder how theyll attack VPNs If they cant that industry will experience a HUGE surge of new customers Thanks Im sitting here in a hotel in Saudi Arabia and saw this and absolutely shat myself thinking that something has been blocked and Ill have the Saudi internet police coming over to lop my hands off  Holy shit that was amazing the way it moves when touched is fascinating The best part of all of this however is the fact that we now know that This comment preview was a free gift to you by your ISP please upgrade to the unlimited Reddit pack for  per month to gain access to the full comment Unlimited as in your packs total volume please check our premium packs for more options While I agree that net neutrality is very important individual posts couldnt be blocked as reddit uses HTTPS The telecommunication act of  is still in effect There will never be a tiered internet The FCC is so evil how are they part of a democracy Here is how I envision these stupid ass ISPs moving forward post NN The same way EA tried to get loot crates to be the norm They will test the waters to see what we will tolerate I suspect that as soon as they try to charge for a service like reddit there should be a huge lawsuit over free speech I have google fiber and honestly I am waiting to see if they do anything Stop karma whoring Just imagine EA being your ISP TBH my life might be better without Reddit You know when this stuff doesnt happen the next fearmongering campaign isnt going to be believed either What will happen metered plans with sites like youtube or facebook unmetered Oh fuck sake not this shit again I cant wait for this shit to end so the spam will stop and then maybe people will start thinking for themselves Dear ISPs Please charge someone an additional fee to access my web site Please Sincerely A future plaintiff in federal court How can I help as a Brit Would you really get an ISP that blocks reddit No one would so the businesses who made reddit an extra fee wouldnt survive in a free market This might be a good thing I could get my life back Ah yes just like before Net Neatrality Several years ago most internet packages in the UK had a data cap Someone started doing unlimited and now everyone does to keep up This is why Im not worried about NN even without the EU We have a functioning market for ISP and a noncorrupt body to govern them Sorry this comment has been blocked by your ISP Please pay m to gain access to Reddit wwwgofccyourselfcom click express Despite VPNs being a thing and all manner of technologies to combat it people still think that american ISPs will have the magic ability to do this without net neutrality in place even though its only ever been a thing for a couple of years I dont get the logic Ok so the internet has been a pretty big deal for the last  years But Im having trouble understanding why this net nuetrality is considered so crucial Title  regulations have only been in place for two years It seems like the hypotheticals people use to defend net neutrality were never a concern before the law was in place Before  I dont remember isps blocking content based on usage stats or competing media Is there actual merit to this or are people just in favor of more government regulation removed I bet  that with or without net neutrality this never happens GET A VPN Thats nice actually been wanting to get off reddit for a while now Thanks government I will spend this extra time to make good life choices Lmao idk about everyone else but I would just stop using the internet at the point they cant make money if nobody uses it Ill go back to reading books and being more social In person Sorry In order to see this post you need reddit gold Reddit uses HTTPS Service providers wouldnt be able to inject a message like that into the site They could block the entire site but then you could still access it with a VPN or the Tor To view this comment you need Internet Pack The intent is to provide players users with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes websites Lets be real who the fuck would pay for reddit  the intent was to give Reddit users a sense of pride and accomplishment Is there any proof comcast would actually implement this type of thing Just seems like fear mongering deleted Lets be real here They wouldnt charge that much a minute because then nobody would use them wed go back to no internet The nefarious things they would do would be like only  cents a minute guys And  cents a minute if you buy our ultimate deal package for yr It seems that they just keep on trying to destroy net neutrality They just never stop I think they are counting on people getting sick and tired of seeing these posts and eventually stop giving a shit about it Then they win As someone in the UK what can we do to help our brethren in the USA Posting on Reddit is fine and all  but you really need to contact your representatives if you want to do something An easy way to do this is through Resistbot resistbotio Text RESIST to  or message facebookcomresistbot on Facebook and theyll find out who represents you in Congress and deliver your message to them in under  minutes No downloads or apps required Redacted  Please pay USD a month to view replys and or comments Has EA just bought reddit Comment blocked by Comcast Hmm Oh well Maybe I should go outside To those who paid the package whats there I cant see it In some places populated areas with multiple ispsnot the really big ones this will help create more competition in rural areas not so much But my boy Elon is working on that Some one tell the government thats it we the people not us the corporation I am surprised at the number of people who have no idea what the actual problem is No Actually I am not Because the real fucking problem takes more action than signing an online petition Since that is all that people are willing to do what you get is a Fix of the problem like Net Neutrality We only think we need NN because of how badly we have all allowed our local governments to behave If your local government allowed real competition of services to your address NN would be nothing but a blight on the ability for companies to tailor offerings to our needs and budgets As it is the lazy have latched onto an idea that instead of doing something about the problem we can cover it up with NN That is fucking stupid FIX THE PROBLEM Get real competition to every fucking address Good its probably a dumb shit post like this anyways Before  I dont care if I have a hard tim starting up because of the subconscious psychological manipulation caused without actually changing any website data which could be charged to access reddit deleted Calm down EA The only way to keep net neutrality is dont pay a penny It worked in Ireland for water charges Shit posts like this are just a circlejerk these shitty spam posts turn people away from supporting net neutrality God are we still doing this stupid shit WE GET IT ALREADY I kind of want ISPs to censor the Internet at this point just so I dont have to see this edgy shitposting  times a day I wish i could upvote this post but i didnt get the premium redditor fedora tip package in my ISP deal  Funny how the country with first amendment rights is the problem to the rest of the world Do All I have to do to farm Karma is say some bullshit on net neutrality Sure its good but It isnt the fucking end of the world Whoa liberals care about censorship now A tad too late my friends So fucking stupid One again bitching about net neutrality with no link to the actual bill for people to make their own conclusion Gotta keep that hivemind healthy removed Are you still talking about net neutrallity Or whatever it is called God you guys never shut up about it Cant wait till this shit is done with A week or two of crying about it doomsday stuff then hopefully back to normal Can someone explain to me how a company external from a website is legally able to charge access to websites they dont own host or overwise have any legal authority over Will they actually be able to charge to access a website they dont own Seems very farfetch to me The irony is this is often framed under the guise of the market being free to regulate itself but in much of the US you only have a choice of one ISP so not really much of a free market Where I am I have a choice of multiple ISPs so I still have a degree of flexibility in boycotting providers that are opposed to net neutrality ISPs roll out loot crates to get decent pings Will you Americans just please call your local representative already and stop this ruling Id really like to get back to normal redditing now  oh yeah I fixed that ages

just call out and insult the people replying Theyll provide all the information you need in just a moments time deleted Have you tried restarting your computer I dont know whats more annoying Someone posting a problem then saying Nvm fixed it Or Someone posting a problem and there are three replies in the thread that are all Bump Im having a problem Same Same Same Same Oh yeah I had that problem but I solved it Thread closed by a moderator I didnt know if I put my cpu in right so I just really hoped I did the rest of the time I was building my pc Naw the real question is where do I download ram I had to Google a problem yesterday clicked on a forum and the only response was I dont know how to fix that Then why waste everybodys and your time posting a response post from Feb  Nvm i found out what the problem was What did you see DenverCoder What did you see deleted OP Im having problem X can anyone help OP next day Never mind I fixed it Posted  years ago Oh nvm I figured it out on my own and am never coming back to tell you guys how goodbye forever Even worse is how any issues with any game is automatically diagnosed as you need to upgrade your computer You can have a ballin computer with a  TI and bleeding edge hardware and if you go to a forum and say Hey the game is really laggy in this part what gives Heres my absurd specs youll always get multiple people saying Uhh dude this is a highend game you need a better PC here are my specs and the game runs fine specs worse than your own Worse is when you have a very specific issue that no matter how specific you try to phrase it on google you cant find one result that actually pertains to it Hell Ive even put in the error code and apparently Im the only one whos ever seen that combination of numbersletters in the world Programming struggling with an issue for hours and googling for ages finally coming along a thread with what seems to be a similar issue OP hey Im having this problem Person have you tried X OP yeah but it didnt work OP nvm I fixed it D last reply  years ago Toms Hardware be like In the pice slot Obviously Everytime Im on google when Im having issues with my AMD Radeon wattman settings My favorite is the solution to the problem that was posted  years ago but is no longer true or relevant because of changes in the hardware or software But every website you go to gives you the same old solution that no longer works   Search for solution to a problem online  Top google search result is a forum where somebody asks the same question  The first response is some edgelord telling the person to google it before asking stupid questions on the forum  The rest of the responses are people reviving the dead thread years later saying they also have the problem and people reeing over necroposting Same problem with me ah yes i have the same problem  where do i put the cpu whats even worse is the nvm fixed it Is this the most reposted meme yet Who are you denvercoder What did you see The CPU goes in the sock I have gb ddr can i get an f in chat Plug it into the PCIe express port google a problem steam forums come up just google it lol can we stop reposting this Oh wow this is on rall AGAIN I was once having a recurring bug in a video game and had to go through ten pages of Same here and Me too just to find a comment by the Devs stating that they were working on it On any d Printing forum Hey Im having an issue and heres what I guess and know about the machine etc etc Have you tried printing slower if not someone else will possibly know point the little gold triangle in the direction of your heart  The worst to me is when you describe your problem what steps youve taken and for example a common mistake is NOT updating the drivers you make extra sure to mention that you did infact update the drivers and the first replies are all still the most bland advice of did u try updating the drivers that fixed it for me Repost I always thought of myself as someone who would never need to post on a forum or in rpcmasterrace for help But damnit I built my wifes computer yesterday and the thing wouldnt boot I had a cold sweat running down my back my heart was racing and the whole time I thought I was a failure  hours later I figured it out but damn now I understand why people post asking for help The best is when the only reply you get is worked for me lol Some condescending stackexchange poweruser telling you why you shouldnt want x instead of explaining how to do x I had a very simple question about a very popular video game It took  comments to answer my question I have a problem Nevermind I solved it Tell us how goddammit My favorite is when you have a problem that is old so thread closed with no solution Everyone knows that you put cpu to your pocket In this context forums  Reddit Sorry It goes in the pci Express slot Note if your PC explodes then well I guess you wont be able to get this comment deleted Nice repost As someone who debugs issues for a living this can be helpful sometimes I mean if no one else is having the issue its got to be something with my specific setup and its much harder to diagnose whats going on If other people are having the issue I know that its wider spread than just me and it may change how I try to find a solutionfix Arent you supposed to shove it inside the psu or someone finds a similar problem and directs you to that solution but its not it A good runner up is replying idk Is the cable inserted Never mind I solved the problem Whyd the sky change colors This subreddit has turned into trash Heres a forum post that explains what to do click the page you requested was not found On the creative cow forums there would be an answer insulting you for even thinking that what youre dealing with is a problem and not the intended operation of the software Just run debug and send the raw data file to my email in my signature I should get back to you by the end of the day Email bounced back with message that address does not exist Uhgggg I saw this meme earlier in new I wish I commented for some of that sweet karma Help me My PC BSOD on boot and loops with different stop codesand I cant even reinstall Windows cus it bsods while installing Im at a total loss that NEVER happens lol deleted Too good Third hand coming down from a passing boat to hand them a letter that says nvm I solved it thread can be closed Logitech ghub is basically this picture This is every thread on Steam when a game doesnt work Yup Happens every time I try to google the problem Im having and after pages full of useless info you end up some random forum someone posted the same issue Then comments are pretty much this Yall just not die in school to flex on the Americans Yeah Im having the same problem Has someone else fixed it yet Wow this is on point was having some obscure disk issues on a Unix box and searching only found unanswered forum posts Sent pm Hi can someone tell me X or Y I dont know why do you want x or Y get A same problem here fixed it nvm The CPU goes on the power supply your welcome NO THE THERMAL PASTE DOES NOT GO ON THE PINS Crate a new account and post a wrong solution In couple of hours you have at least  smartasses knowing it better You first download it than launch Pro tip When looking for a solution to a problem add Solved or Solution to your search term Often it will narrow down search results to forums of users that posted the steps to solving that problem Mods should lock the comments on this post with a sticky comment saying Never mind guys I figured it out  Did you try sfcexe scannow I swear to God that line frustrates me so much I make a point to register on the forum and insult the shit out of the guys jesus do we need garbage memes in this sub too Sounds exactly like github issues to me Ah yes my days toying around with ubuntu This shit again How do I fix this issue Find forum post of person with same problem Ah sweet heres a solution mfw post has one vague answer is  years old and in relation to a version  iterations ago FuCKiNG DAmnit DUde deleted Nvm Re And Why dont you do a search This has been answered hundreds of times Thread closed under every single thread about the problem To add to the others Tutorials that show you how to fix things but skip steps Ive seen quite a few where they just assume I know how to do a certain thing and dont really explain it In fact I feel like its a lot of tutorials I run into Ill get half way then have to open another tab to figure out what program theyre running and how to use it Its especially annoying when its on YouTube and youre watching them do it but then they just edit out some of the steps Like you did it to make the video You didnt just type out what to do online Why dont you include it in the final upload Even if it seems simple and dumb and you feel like the person watching would obviously know just put it in there anyways One person had the same issue  days ago WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU SEE blank template for this meme the ones i really hate are the ones where people reply use the goddamn search theyre many threads on this issue and they have all been deleted the runner ups are the first post the issue and second is op saying its fixed with no explanation This happened to me while setting up a usb of windows on my computer This meme also works for when you ask a question in randroid I still cant figure out how to change my text message background on the new update on galaxy s Oh yeah I havent figured it out either WellMe either so here we are lol marks post as solved without saying what solved the problem  My favourite Me hey guys I have this X problem could someone tell me how to fix it Random guy yes I have it to The same random guy waitI solved

out a correction Or when OP comes back and says never mind I figured it out It doesnt help anyone else that comes across the same problem rprogrammerhumor is leaking SOLVED Just Google it Loser Umthanks I didand this was the only thing that came up uSE gOoGLe Relevant xkcdhttpsxkcdcom Here I am feeling the same way with my Xbox one x that has a known issue There are literally hundreds of

replies up you bump it for the other person without them having to bump it and if you get an answer  both of you will get notified xB edit  its the same with bumping a modding or general bug fix thread that ended up on a far back page on steam forums to the front so people that have the bug see the thread that has a fix  just writing this helped or im having the same problem  on threads without replies  reduces the amount of copy threads and if someone ends up finding a solution the other person will know too And the worst forum messages to see Nvm guys i fixed it thread closed Oh i

and GPU MHz it wont even go up it just stays stuck on Mhz  Amazon q and a in a nutshell I had one of these over the weekend where I was able to fix the problem and also help the other guy I felt pretty good about that in the dim slots DUH The worst one Ive ever encountered was when my audio wasnt working after a blue screen I asked after a while if it would help if I updated the BIOS since Id already tried everything else They told me that probably wasnt an issue Three days later at the end of my patience I update the BIOS and what do you know I fixed it If it has even the slightest possibility of working I want to know Dont say No that wont work when it might work We need an unsolved tech mysteries website that links back to the post and offers real solutions I am having problems with software X telling me error such and such Can someone help me Lol just use software Y Theres always that guy that says google it hurr hurr Can I have Jesus walking on water when correcting someone I literally prefer to get any fucking response I think you stick it in the motherboard open the square or rectangle bit pop it in the right way up Then add your thermal paste on top pop the fan Im before it dries creating a seal so the heat from the CPU goes to the fan or similar method just do it I guess then jobs a good en And remember to plug CPU fan wires in Pretty much all I got was Throw it away Why this guy getting like k upvotes This was posted like  months ago Im having that problem too Anyone know how to make them go away starting to get really annoying now Speaking of which I had a question about a fan controller in my pc but apparently only  people have the same one and no one knows how to get the controller connected to the motherboard to sync the lighting In the thing How to install google chrome Stack Overflow in a nutshell I HATE Threads like this Where someone asks a question and all of the responses are people having the same issue Its like chickens with their heads cut off Theres also Im having a totally different problem that sounds the same but Im not going to make a new post Isnt this a repost in my experience reddit has been the only place that consistently provided great answers and usually is quick to respond too In the PCIe slot derp truly I appreciate knowing Im not alone REEEPOST This omits the  links to the perfect answers to questions you never asked Just because of that after many years of putting up to this exact selfish fuckery I found a solution to micro stutter on gimbals for GoPro cameras I have watched hundreds of videos with this problem and read all the posts no lucko Since then I only answer NVM I know how to fix it now In the CPU slot Dude just google it  Everyone Thanks thats how I got here solved but doesnt say how CPU goes inside the floppy disk drive fyi for anyone wondering That is always a relief a confirmation that its not my hardware or software Thats basically  of stackoverflow I searcher

CPU in the USB slot I think I just cant find the wire CPU Holder next to the Southeast Brace Usually for me no one else has ever had the same problem yep  every fking time that i open up any forum to

generic solution you already tried but is willing to actually help furtherrecognizes you already tried basic solution and is willing to help further Random User Duhhh I have a similar issue and am going to clutter your thread with my problem Another User I will encourage this bad behavior by trying to help the hijacker Another User Hey I have a similar issue too that actually and obviously isnt and will further clutter your thread with my problem Another User I too will answer the completely unrelated problem question further encouraging this bad forum etiquette because I too do the same thing Original and Useful User stop posting about their original discussion and leave the thread leaving the original problem unsolved Thanks you thread hijacking jerkwads Repost gOoGlE iT u DuMb sHiet Is this loss Literally happened to me earlier today so annoying Well if its an intel cpu ask for a refund If it is past its refund date put it in the freezer and MAYBE you will get normal thermals The traffic light ones are worse Do I include the poles or not Who knows it only works  of the time anyway Its hit and miss with these Sometimes you have to take a chance and get the tires obligatory videohttpsyoutubezGWTRtcDeQ I go for the   completion Normally the bots just want the squares where it is fully in the square whenever I complete one of these things and it says I was wrong my faith in autonomous cars falls ever so slightly Captcha has turned into such a pain in the ass Do the stop light poles count too The worst is when you have to redo the captcha each time you attempt to remember one of your  go to passwords Is this the website that requires special characters and numbers Shit cant remember  minutes later and  captchas later fuck this site Fuck its annoying Dont leave us hanging what is the answer Troll the AIhttpwwwcommitstripcomentrollingtheai Doesnt matter itll be wrong the first  times no matter what you do The correct answer is none of the squares It asks for buses plural and none of the squares contain a plurality of buses Source I am a robot Nah but tires Its actually using how much you sweat to determine if youre a robot Dont try to pick what you think the captcha wants to see pick what you think is the correct answer You are training the program to think like a human and the correct answer is based on what other humans select as a bus rTiresaretheenemy Tyres Whats next colour lol Fun fact Thet already know youre human from your mouse movements These are just a trick for free crowdsourced training for their self driving car ai Its interesting that proving Im not a robot is one of my biggest day to day struggles Every god damn time I laughed harder than is reasonable for this Always There is also a tiny bit of bumper on lower right pic I swear these things are more about google using people to teach their AIs how to identify things then people having to prove their are not robots Looks more like a coach than a bus Choose all the bridges Those are just overpasses What the fuck Sorry please try again Mother fucker Ah Yes The typical PCmasterrace post consisting of relatable captcha memes Absolutely nobody Americans WhAtS a tYrE Have they only just figured out theres differences between wordspronunciationsspellings in each English speaking country orrrr I find with most of these there is some room for error If you had the  blocks selected and then one selected in the bottom right corner it will still pass you So true Me every goddamn time Firefoxanti tracking extensionsvpn Doing this dozens of times only to be blocked by Google for suspicious activity HA HA YES FELLOW HUMAN ITS SO CONFUSING BUT WHAT IS THE ANSWER Or when its traffic lights is it just the lights or the metal poles too rtiresaretheenemy TIL they are spelled tyres in British English THE WHEELS ON THE BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND For those who wondering what is a tyre its Tire but with different spelling ITT Americans trying to get their heads round the fact that people speak English in other geographic locations Technically buses is plural so just which freaking squares do they want  I hate these since I need to solve  captchas at a time tires don exits Asshole design traffic lights are worse do i select only the ones pointing to the camera only these where you can see an actual light or the whole damn construction on the intersection with the ones across and in the sides what about the pedestrian ones If you get it wrong someones self driving car is going to be trained wrong and youre going to cause a car crash Do you want your futureselfs selfdriving car to avoid the tires If so select the tires Most of the time if it doesnt occupy more than say  of a square it doesnt want you to click it Select the entire bus If the AI cant see it thats their problem In the future well have to use these captchas to find whos a robot and whos human It dosent matter its the time you took to calculate and your average accuracy which matters I always get fucked up by the street sign one because I include the posts they are attached to These arent even too bad the worst are the ones where you select the tiles until none of the object remain because it takes like  goddamn seconds for that last tile to load another picture of the thing you need to get rid of recaptcha is one of the most retarded things on the internet You should always get the first three captcha wrong so that we can slow down the eventual rise of SkyNet You are training your future master Is that just me or if you move your mouse around a lot it detects that you are a human well at least for recappitchas I thought all this was just to train robots on detecting these things Ive never failed one Dont feel bad Your labour is being used to train AI computer vision which will enable it to more rapidly steal your job in the near future I always try and do the crappiest job possible that it will accept Teach Google to outsource US road image testing to us in annoying ways This is why I hate captchas I think I speak for everyone when I say these things are fucking stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupid When it asks for buses itll show NOT buses ie motorhomes trucks and ill say no busses and it tells me Im fucking wrong Despite being a fucking bus driver for a living FUCK YOU COMPUTER YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS WRONG Yes you select the tires lol I have to bring attention to CGP Greys video on algorithmshttpsyoutubeROHnZFUo At the  mark specifically But the whole video is worthwhile Tires are the things on your car that make contact with the road If the square is mostly covered by that thing select it If not dont Also no poles on traffic lightssigns They use this data to train selfdriving AI so select ONLY WHAT IS IMPORTANTESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT FOR YOU May god have mercy on your soul if the reCaptcha wants you to select traffic lights or crosswalks Without fail those work exactly  of the time Id rather just send in a vial of my blood to prove Im human I feel like captchas test confidence over accuracy Like you spend  minutes discerning details and it issues you a new one Or you click anything quick and hit accept and its like oh yeah thats a human let em through You dont even have to correctly select things for it to give you a goahead You just have to interact with it period In case youre wondering youre really just training Googles self driving ai for free Moving the mouse is enough for the website to know youre a person Isnt data mining great  I failed about  of these in a row last night apparently I was infuriated I ended up drinking over it when I wasnt planning to drink Congratulations you are the first person to make a dark mode friendly meme without boasting about it on the title I like to do  or  wrong on purpose because why should Google get free labour from me They stopped using text based captchas because people kept spamming the N word I sometimes intentionally take a couple more minutes to try to pass the test while also answering it wrong Fuck their human powered AI learning process Its all just free training for Googles automated cars anyway Congrats you are teaching for free Imagine not using buster Any of these image Capchas that say Skip at the bottom you can ignore you only need to do the ones that say Verify Only the largest pieces usually work quite well Tires but ok I fucking hate store fonts They give me images that looks like they were taken by putting tape on your grandmas eye than have a cell phone take a picture of it then have a camera in the top of the building take a picture of the screen of the phone without any type of stabilisation in an storm Just so you know i failed a captcha once HAHA YES FELLOW HUMAN I TOO CAN ENJOY THIS JOKE BECAUSE MY VISUAL CORTEX IS EQUALLY STIMULATED I forgot which subreddit I was in for a second there Dont bother its too tyreing What if all this captcha crap is just a big scam to somehow help with machine learning or something Whats a Tyre I am so tyred of that kashoot me pls I am tyred of this captcha  Tires filthy europeans Tires and yes Theyre part of the bus A bus without wheels is a building isnt it tires ive never seen the word tyres and it seems strange having that y in the middle Tires Kinda unfunny I hope this is satyre Buses instead of busses bothers me and I had to look it up xB It looks like buses is correct My life is a lie xB httpsgrammaristcomspellingbusesbusseshttpsgrammaristcomspellingbusesbusses  Tyromancy says maybe Press those headphones and boom  second completion No It didnt ask about bus tyres Only ID the requested targets for extermination There is a bus in the review mirror of the SUV Also should i select the shadow too Because its a part of the bus too What about the shadow Happens to me Always ALWAYS Who ever designed those captchas can go truck themselves No you shouldnt  The one with one image never fucking works tired to bet my life at each captcha A robot wouldnt have spent any second hesitating Select the traffic lights Is the absolute worst It always fails for me I have tried just the lights and box and I have tried including the pole as well It never works Yes Without tires theres just sparks on the road I always have this issue with the grainy pics Does the traffic sign include the pole holding it up Does it include that street corner over there that should have a sign Am I a robot Plot twist its actually a coach Ahh discord user If you miss the tires then when they train the computers on this data those selfdriving cars will be tireblind Youll kill countless numbers of people Dont get this wrong The traffic lights always get me do you select the poles also or just the lights themselves useansg I hate these so much I still dont think Ive ever gotten the stop light ones right I heard that these captchas make search engines smarter It sounds good and scary at the same time Good that it might make search easier scary that it sounds like Skynet is getting better by the day My least favorite is traffic lights SELECT ALL SPACES THAT CONTAIN SIDEWALKS Youve brought this upon yourself Are shadows of the bus important Is tyre the word of the day if you are on tor youll have another chance Maybe google or whoever runs these captcha things are having us click images to better teach their ai what things look like Ai can see buses and storefronts really well of true These things got me thinking more than my dissertation did Its not a pass or fail thing as such you basically just have to get similar to what everyone else got thats how theyre training their AIsSo if most people think its the tires then the ai will think its tires and then the captcha will think its the tires xB for new images theyre training you can just press whatever and itll work or they might force you to do  just for shiggles THANK GOD THIS ISNT JUST ME I just select the squares that have a small piece of the image Its all for googles AI projects and machine learning so the less accurate the better  Is tyres another one of those British spelling differences Lol rfoundthebritishuser I often have to ask myself if Im a robot after failing these over and over Im really tired of these Thisll probably get lost assuming it has already been mentioned or others post above me but I believe if you hold down the Im not a robot checkbox for a few seconds rather than simply clicking it the captcha almost never loads and you bypass it immediately Dumb reCAPTCHA punishing people for privacy oriented web browsing What are tyres in Freedom language how human of you Should I select the pole on the stop sign How did I miss a bus Is that a bus recaptcha resets  I select every box that has any car component So yes I always would choose the tire boxes TFW youre a robot It actually depends on what other people pick I pick as few tiles as I can I didnt sign up to train AI No does not fill  if page or more Id say yes Its part of the bus Funnily enough theres an extension to solve these for you deleted I hate these things Only a robot would not know the answer to this question All yellow cars are taxis The top right and and bottom right only have one bus So should not be selected theres still a bit of truck where the tires are rassholedesign They lied about the wheels Are feet shoes rtiresaretheenemy I hate those shits so much I smell a robot Prove prove to me that you are not a robot Is less about what you select and more about how bots tend to move directly to the boxes and select inhumanely fast There reads skip at the bottom just skip till there reads verify so u only have to do one Captchas are getting more and more annoying Soon youll have to do an SAT to sign up for things If the entity is in the grid I will pick that grid Thats my rule if they want to be accurate make the grids smaller xD If you select less than three tiles they make you pick again I always get this type of captcha wrong Why make it so hard  British spelling is inscrutably stupid There is only one bus therefore there are no buses therefore you select no squares I fucking hate those captchas so much You are suppose to prove you are not a robot by selecting vehicles in a picture Mean while there is Teslas driving with autopilot that detect vehicles Clearly not the best way to prove to be human lol sometimes ya just gotta wing it in life I feel like if someone photoshopped a terminator eye on this picture it would be perfect When the hitbox isnt very clear Hard choices requires a hard will Where do the wheels on the bus go  Learn about us and our

post reaches the top  of rall and being lazy I give it a different date each time and that doesnt matter either shrug According to the age verification in the store I was born on January st some year between  depending on how much I dont care SteamValve will not remember my age but theyll happily autoenable the option of saving my payment information for later at checkout Just checking you havent used an anti age serum recently My account is almost  years old When it turns  checkmate Steam Valve please fix Literally unbrowsable I think they have to ask for age for legal reasons though i could be wrong what do you mean when  you know very well I was born on  sweats profusely Just pick a year in the s or earlier and contribute to the worlds biggest collection of people born on January st Why do they need to periodically ask if you still use the same email And then to verify it to this day this is the most annoying and stupid thing they didnt fix yet even taking a look at the page of a game you own its asking you for your age How about that stupid friends window that I never asked for that cant ever connect The technology just isnt there yet rbikinibottomtwitter Im more irritated that triple A games can get away with sexual themes but anything else cant I dont get why they even have that its not like its gonna stop a kid from looking at it im pretty sure everyone has the mental capacity to change the year to  or lower Its even worse when I already own the game but still have to verify my age Its even better when it requires it for games you already own Your birthdate is protected information and the less personally identifiable information Valve keeps the less their risk Especially now under GDPR laws The less they keep the better Everyone born on January first of any year raise your hand And why the fuck does it have to warn me every fucking time I click a link leading out of the site I find it odd that not a single other company is so obsessively worried about this security risk except for steam Im really not too bothered by this mild inconvenience were all born on Jan st anyways The say its not being stored so I just put  This is like so to allow underage people to lie their age afterwards Its not inefficient it is deviantly efficient If you use Enhanced Steam on browser it will automatically verify your age each time  It has a ton of other super useful features Why do they even have an option to select your birthday as today Like im  minutes old can look at DOOM I choose a random date every time and im in no questions asked except by dob Really Stop wasting my time Every fucking time However valve now think that Im a  year old male The Discord store is just a  click confirmation button much simpler Pretty sure there was some statistic that said that like  of peoples birthdays on steam were Jan  Lol How long has this been an issue for Jesus Gabe stop fucking smoking pot and fix it already Im over  but I still enter a fake age Its easier to select  or  and keep it at  January than to enter my real birthdate Porn website  Me sure January   Jokes aside that is a legal thing not Valves actual will I think this is the single biggest thing I want changed on steam right now They did it the mad men They did They actually fixed it I like how you have to re enter it every time but if you accidentally put down that youre younger than  itll hold you against you forever until you delete some files i think its made for shared computers Honestly just click on the year and scroll  so years behind Its only annoying if youre trying to be accurate every time I think I heard somewhere they dont store that information because it was against the user privacy In that case I kind of aggre with their action course here Same with when you are signed in and you are looking in the store and tells you to sign in to see your recommendations All the way down to  baby Why yes I am a  year old Druid in disguise Fun fact According to Steam most people are born on January the First Anyone else hate the new placement of your icon I miss the good old days when it was in the bottom right Yep Fix this I created my account  years ago I feel like they should know that I was at least  years old I was  Thats annoying after every time I use steam What about the volume being turned off even of you press play on the video preview I fucking pressed play I dont need to turn it on then turn up the volume to hear the video I just pressed play on january st  but sometimes im feeling adventurous and do  I figure by now Steam thinks Ive been born on Jan st for every year from  to  A friend and I bitch about this all the time   Hey uProfnemesis This is now the top post on reddit It will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts its so pointless to ask anyways even an  year old is going to claim he is  years old when viewing Hentai simulator  It used to save it thats the most frustrating part Actually Steam asks you if youre over  when you make an account not  Im about to hit my  year anniversary on steamhttpsiimgurcomiMPzXppng Im wondering if in three years when the account itself is  if it will still pester me about age verification but I know Im going to be disappointed Cant wait until steam keeps asking  year old accounts if theyre over  At least theres not a captcha This is easily the best use of this format According to steam I was born on February st Anyone else have an issue where steam scrolls too much No other windows application has this problem for me Steam support was  help deleted and being lazy I give it a different date each time and that doesnt matter either shrug  account details  update store preferences  Uncheck Blur and warn about content that may contain frequent nudity or sexual content  Uncehck Blur and warn about content that may contain frequent violence or gore  go onto another m rated game you can check the box to not show the warning for any games You can thank me later  of steam users were born on Jan st Steam doesnt ask for your age when you sign up They just make you check a box that says youre over  I knew it was coming but still read it all the way through and still erupted in laughter Have your upvote I dont understand why they even bother in the first place absolutely no one puts their actual birthday I think they have to do this to comply with some countries laws Just like if you visit a website for an alcoholic brand they will make you confirm your age Steam knows your age but since youre technically visiting a website in the steam software theyll make you confirm it again to comply with  game laws Dude This apparently got so popular that they fixed it httpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsunknownpnghttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsunknownpng Steam has a shit UI and I really feel like this isnt brought up enough tfw to this day the commenthttpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentstdhwhyigottaverifyeyco I got most upvotes on ever was a previous post of this exact meme Its a shame that what works once will only really work once I personally see nothing wrong with under s playing  games ir acessing content that isnt suitable for their age as all the good games that attracts the most attention are games that are  and over This is my two sense so feel free to have an opinion just pick any year starting with  and your good rassholedesign This subreddit is such repost trash General Reposti I am waiting for them to crack down on everyone for entering false birthdays when they were just trying to save time lol Ive gotten that fucking alert while clicking on a game I already own because the front page said there was new DLC for it So whats going on here Valve You think that even though I went through the steps of buying the game I might have regressed in age We have gone over this before Steam does not know who is looking at the screen They cannot infer this from the Steam account because parents often own the account for their kids Think about it I will be  years old in less than  months Sometimes I still get carded when trying to buy beer Its not because I look young and the  yearold cashier cant tell whether Im under  or not Its because the brainless corporate middlemanagers have decided to force all the cashiers to check the ID of their customers regardless of how obviously old they are Apart from Trump supporters there are no greater forms of stupidity in all the universe than retail middlemanagement and suburban city government Also you need a card to get most games love this weeeeee Please remember my age Ill opt in if need be Ill give you my social security and a copy of my birth certificate I will swear you my firstborn on a contract sealed with blood tears semen whatever  your pick honestly Im not going to fight you on this one Just please stop asking me how old I am The answer is old enough The answer has been old enough every single time youve asked Its not like Im ever going to get any fucking younger because that is not how the passage of time works I just hope that in a few years when my account is over  years old itll finally stop asking me January st is gonna be a hell of a birthday party As soon as steam requires a set DOB be ready for some changes Its a canary in a coal mine You can deactivate the screen in your settings Careful what you wish for You might end up having to match the exact date you input when you created your account Wouldnt put it past them Steam sets up a  day trade hold On  day coupons and theyve thrown me off my rhythm They save credit cards but not age information because its cheaper than having a system that remembers users age Hey Gabe has more important shit like eating his hourly pizza I believe this is to be compliant with some countries and states age restriction policies But yeah I dont see why it cant just detect where you are and ask accordingly OH OH And dont get me fucking started on the is this still your email dialog This actually makes me mad when i see that fucking page Like please if you qant steam after we make the account ask once then just fucking stop I also dont know how many times Ive told steam that yes my email is still my email I wonder what happens if your account is over  years old Like if it was created in the early s I was just yelling internally about this earlier this morning Look I get that its mildly frustrating to adults but thats not the point Theyve probably only lost a sale because of it a very small portion of the time and what does asking every time and not knowing mean It means that if audited they cant say for sure that they should have known a user was a minor based on previous input information because they just dont track it This is a loophole that allows them to do their diligence without keeping fun shiny games away from teenagers If they did this I guess presumably with everyone else online we would have all had a harder time enjoying the things we enjoyed online as teens and they would lose a ton of sales by blocking all accounts of users signed in that have shown elsewhere they are minors Would you rather a world where adults have a minor trivial hurdle or a world where when you were  it was waaaay more annoying to buyplaywatch anything about GTA I always put the date at  when I was really born in  What annoys me more is that I have my profile set to friends only and whenever I want to view part of my profile which I am logged into it wont show me my profile because its private I have to open it a second time before the client realises its my own profile Is this probably just to cover their assess liability wise Steam even recognizes my  year old account with a badge prominently displayed upon my profile Could they not realise by their own policies I must be at least  years old I like it cuz Im  and I put in my real birthdate when I made my account but Im obviously old enough to play M rated games What is the point though it doesnt even care about your birthdate At some point soon Ill have been a Steam user for  years and theyll still ask me Pretty sure its against the rules to show your username you might wanna blur that out or something Had this very thought yesterday  pretty sure its so kids can still acess and buy games they wouldnt otherwise be able to This is the best use of this meme Ive seen so far And yes its fucking annoying What if the account is under the name of Benjamin Button He could be over  when he created the account but eventually hell be under  Ive also had that happen to me multiple times Just open the dropdown menu for year and choose the oldest date no need to scroll or change daymonth Not that this makes it any better that you have to go through this lol Most fucking relatable post Ive ever found on reddit Sigh Here I am years of service entering my exact birth date each and every time hoping that one day one day would be the promised day For that day I still await One of the dumbest programming things Ive ever seen so true I always select like  as my birth year let em think some  year old is playing call of duty maybe they need it for confirmation that its true owner using the account  something like that Yeah what if you are Benjamin Button huh January   Its to protect against the nephew or brother from entering through your logged in account I wish they would just fkn FIX THAT In another  years my Steam account will be  years old If they ask me my age even then ill lose it very well done love it I just scroll down to a random year Lol I thought I was the only one THEN when I get tired of putting my birthdate in and just pick the first one I scroll to it decides to keep that one wtf Steam You dont need to be  for Steam only  Gabe once said according to their data the vast majority of Steam users were born on Jan st Steam knows my card details but can remember my birthday Similar story in the steam App It can provide my FA token just fine and even displays my username at the bottom But if I want to use it for anything else I need to login  The real funny part is the sometimes in the title Absolutely I hate this Think its a govt thing maybe I was just talking to a friend about this the other day And if you enter the wrong birthday its a hassle to redo it It wont remember if youre old enough but itll sure remember if youre not They knew your age at the time you signed up idiot Unfortunately Anybody waiting for steam age statsgraphs Steam doesnt ask for your age when you sign up though You only check a box stating that you are  years or older nobody would dare lie to steam Itll be even worse when some of us have accounts for over  years lol Oh cool Im not the only one Soooo frustrating This shit If you select the wrong age you have to wait h to try again I theorize that steam is able to widen their market by allowing this Parents will set up a kids account then when the kid gets a gift card he can lie about his age to get the game he wants ujarlphokas I would slightly tolerate it if it at least saved to the intended age but it just resets it to fucking January  current year Maybe there is x pixel hidden ad on the age verification page They are collecting the big bucks I think this is to allow pre kids to buy mature games by giving them a free loweffort loophole Imagine if little Jimmy could play CoD on his PS but couldnt get the newer one off of steam for PC Little Jimmy would be angry and CoD would have literally  sales on PC lol Yeahits a moronic system Just in case your age changed  minutes ago let me ask Oh by the wzy we know your age anyway It really do be like that sometimes Steam We dont store personal information like your age But we can store your address and credit card details if you want Learn about us and our historyhttpspcmasterraceorghistory PCMR isnt just a subreddit but

loop doesnt overclock m thats when you just nod your head and say yes so she doesnt cut your PC parts budget anything over  kelvin is a heating issue so therefore it still doess Ive been building gaming rigs since  and I have yet to use water cooling I guess Im just a pleb As someone whos just trying to sneak a  build budget past my wife  on cooling seems excessive Wife Whats in that Amazon box Me A new power supply for my PC My video drivers keep crashing and I am pretty close to the limit of my current power supply so I think it might be power related Wife Thats nice honey You do you Installs new power supply Me Still crashing Fuck Also me Maybe I need a new video card Did your other  dress stop fitting you Duck and cover httpsimgurcomIrQhPtd I get it now OP trying to make us think he has a wife Well for Nvidia GPUs its best to always have them under C Not like they are slowing down otherwise but the GPU Boost  has the most aggressive boost if the GPU is under C So I just upgraded from an R X to a GTX  Big upgrade really nice now I can run my games at a steady  fps even at p instead of having to drop it down to p andor deal with a lower framerate I was trying to explain to her why  fps is so important and how much better games look at native resolution instead of upscaled and her eyes just glazed over So I joked that theres no difference between Sketchup and Revit because they both draw buildings shes an architectural drafter and she just rolled her eyes and went back to her book In her defense if my husband spent that much for a part Id ask what was wrong with the allinone he had installed p ITT People bragging Saved you a read My mate got a custom PC build a while ago spent near k AUD he got a gtx auroa was told it was water cooled along with the cpu of course I wanted to see this bad boy the GTX was air cooled when I asked him he said the water runs through the MoBo I thought he was having a lend that is what the people over at Storm Computers told him I have shown him videos pictures renderings of all things water cooled v air cooled does not believe me lmao Yes My first computer was in a no ac dorm room and my  gt rest its soul suffered from heat stress and became progressively less reliable over three years Also maintaining a custom water loop is kinda fun This is my inner monologue everytime I see a nice deal on a cooling system My current setup runs perfectly fine with low temps Id love to upgrade to a fancier more efficient water cooling system but Im having no issues right now sooo damn now I gotta check out amazon again No but it might make the computer last longer and therefore save some money in the long run Ok who are we kidding D This sub in a nutshell Reply Nobody drives aircooled cars anymore why should I have to settle for an aircooled PC This sums up why I havent pulled the trigger yet on a custom water loop I keep trying to convince my wife I need a p hz monitor when I already have  p monitors She just doesnt get that it will make me so much better at games which will contribute to the family somehow deleted I dont get this Are you not overheating Are you even overclocked Why would you buy a coolant system if so Oh I like this meme I have several friends that adore their cooling systems build rigs I cant afford and call me when there is a virus I show up and they like to brag so they always ask if I have cooling to which I reply fans They tell me all of the issues theyve had with installing and leaks Ive got almost  games on Steam and not once had a cooling issue They own and play at most two games usually CSGO and Civ V I never comment on it but I am always thinking wtf did you do this instead of buying a better card sir your card sucks minimum you could have bought two of them for it to make any sense Oh and my favorite do you overclock this Of course you dont Whats it like having Cillian Murphy for a wife deleted ITS NEVER ENOUGH COOLING NEVEEER You mean exwife Nobody needs that kind of negativity in their life I recently had a twentyminute conversation with my brother about upgrading his GPU He was trying to decide whether he wanted to upgrade his ti to a ti or possibly a Titan Conversation might not be the best word to describe that interaction He kept explaining how much he wanted one and I kept telling him that its absolutely unnecessary since the only game he has played in the last year has been Stardew Valley and the bump from  FPS to  FPS isnt worth  hes gonna spend Anyways his ti comes in tomorrow and Im stoked about helping him install it Its all about the build and the building You No but didnt you hear me C Your wife is quite handsome Strong jawline New pcmr slogan Its not because we need to Its because we can Ive built dozens of PCs going back to  DX anyone and none of them used water cooling Its a neat trick but completely unnecessary What about when its  slower alt does the  sign Its an older meme sir but it checks outhttpsimgurcomCRTbuNC Its an older meme format sir but it checks out Why do people in this thread need permission to buy things with their money Well it did when the default clock speed was increased to  soooo When I spend nearly a  Euros on custom water cooling it was to not only broaden my knowledge about water cooling but also overclocking and it taught me allot about hardware in general and it fueled my hardware interests to insane levels It can be so much more then just pushing your rig to do more it can very much be worth it I do have to say this was back in  when I did my first water cooled rig Well did it well did it Never going water it doesnt matter Or she does Running an AMD FX the quiteness is sooooo worth the  for a AIO loop Tell your wife to stop wasting money Im sure her PC is fine  Hey uStageFright This is now the top post on reddit It will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts Been a hot minute since Ive seen this meme But thats the  model of Huracan isnt it Thats like so old now two revisions behind Probably not even the Performante version which youd clearly want for best performante out of your hardware THIS MY FIRST CAR CAN IT RUN  MPH Fucking prebuilt More like Its not much but its minehttpsiimgurcomcEBsgMsjpg Im only  years old every time i see a first build thats like an i   and they are wondering if it can run minecraft with shaders i can hear my first pc fxti screaming in pain I always loved the old quote comparing cars and PCs I cant remember whose quote it was If cars were like PCs we would all drive autos that ran like Ferraris were comfortable like Bentleys got  miles to the gallon and cost  However once a year the car would inexplicably explode killing all of its occupants Lol its true But sometimes its just how it is Two buddies of mine have been console gaming for years Were all adults with jobs and responsibilities My first build was years ago and was a  core pentium processor As adults they are finally jumping ship to PC for destiny  shadowkeep Both of them have a Ryzen x with a ti build the weird thing is that gaming on a lower end pc is somehow more satisfying i own  machines one with a ti and k as my main gaming rig and another with a  and an RX as my office PC whenever i game on the office machine i always feel like man this thing actually still holds on like a champ sure playing any game with max settings is sweet but its not quite the same satisfaction edit for clarification I still prefer gaming on my main rig thats why i built it Im just saying that fiddling with settings to make newer games run on older hardware has its own charm people be super humble because gamers are the most insecure bastards on the planet the slightest bit of brag and they will shit on you to make themselves feel better This was me I basically went from shit ass college broke to moderate adult income after university The very first thing I bought was a computer I bought a computer before I bought forks and plates I like to think about my PC like its a Porsche like Its not top of the line super fancy Lamborghini Bugatti or Ferrarilike but its still quite nice better than what most of the people use and I like it And its mine  Then Linuss build are like a Space X rockets This post getting k votes speaks volumes on the financial state of the average user in this sub More on Its not mine but its much  The only issue I have with those build posts is that by now theyre all the same so nothing unique anymore Theyre all fancy cases with overpriced components and too much RGB I know they improve FPS Back in the days where people doing case mods since all cases were boring grey RGB was nonexisting and even windows had to be made by ourselves there I was really impressed of what people made Homer taught us that youre envious not jealous Built my pc at the end of  still runs AAA games on high settings and runs my Oculus S just fine By the time I want to build another one it should be a k machine Dont need no stinking  card Unless someone wants to give me one in which case I do need a  card please thank you Every time I see one of these top end first build posts especially the prefect cable management custom loop ones I think bullshit Im not saying its not possible I just think its unlikely and theyre fishing for karma Whos going to go from console gaming and dip their toes into PC gaming by dropping  The thing is that even the most expensive computer is going to be maybe K to build The cheapest car is around K A lot of people can save up a couple grand if they have a good job so it wouldnt be hard to build a great computer your first time x XT first build hypeee Coming Soon  BuiltNotBought Lmao if I ever get a luxury car thats the statement I would use Thats rbattlestations in a nutshell Heres the thing Last weekend I did in fact build my first PC but I didnt post photos because everyones gonna call me a fake and hate Even though its got an rx and a  Doesnt even have RGB headlights or underglow Pathetic I mean g vs g Get your money up ive always compared building a pc to cars parts of course you cant build your own car yet Its because the shitty or non remarkable first builds posts dont get voted to the top And just like my car my PC is also the equivalent of a base model  Honda civic no RGB this could be better Naw If this sub was rcars wed all be botching about how the PCs dont nearly make enough horsepower and how it doesnt have a manual PREBUILT This entire sub is full of shit like its my first build dont judge I was on a tight budget What the fuck the guy had a RTX  OC and an i k with GB of mhz Like the fuck you mean budget And why is your very first custom Pc the top of the line I personally would terrified if I was building my first ever pc with  dolary doo shits Imagine if cars were as affordable as PCs Im over here driving a volo b Old but indestructible This but its mine saying has been overused on every single sub that has a build aspect to it My first one was a Pentium  with a gt rofl Quad core came  months after the GT Purchase There was a bit of a bottleneck on the cpu Im old OK I deserve it lol rEyebleach now has an equivalent trend where people post a pic of their pet saying so and so didnt get much love on raww My first pc had an Asus Gtx  with gb of vram gb of ddr ram An gb ssd i gen and was basically a Skyrim machine Im about to go all out soon It will be me th build If I post with the specs of my previous modest builds would that help And yall got mad at me for taking tin snips to my case to fit a  when it barely could fit a hd Word cloud out of all the commentshttpsiimgurcomnDXIzcpng Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit Enjoy I remember feeling like a baller the first time I had a computer with a gigabyte hard drive If PCMR was any other subs it would be starter pacs half the post here are ItS nOt MucH BuT iTs My FirSt BuIld starter pacs or posts like the one you made OP For every genuine first build be kind post theres like  unoriginal garbage meme just like this one But that is rcars Just got my dream car not much but its mine  GTRS Meanwhile the rest of us are driving Corollas But it would need rgb spinner rims This sub makes me feel like my  is embarrassing to own cries in Honda Civic Reddit is trying to make me feel bad by suggesting posts from this sub I dont even own a pc Oh god I laughed out loud on this one I just got to upgrade  years ago but before that I was using an old Frankenstein style build to run GTA on the lowest settings Everyone time Id come to PCMR it would make me die a little inside You laugh but its exactly how it mostly is in rcars Just bought my first car  Shows brand new BMW  series Needs more RGB Yeah it looks great but under the hood the it has a shit engine My build be here like a Corvette All plastic but still performs good for the price Nailed it Is there anything more shitposty than this sub Im really beginning to believe not Thats cause most of these kids have no idea what they are buying I really dont think theyre doing it on purpose All of reddit does this humble brag shit man Its really lame at this point rfoundthemobileuser Does this mean the MacApple guys are akin to Prius drivers Its taken me  years to get my pc where it is My first build had a couple generations old i and a ti with  gb ram I still use the cpu mobo and ram but ive upgraded my gpu to a strix ti and swapped the case to a phanteks enthoo elite and i have a custom hardline loop for my gpu and cpu Big upgrades from my first build That being said my used parts have all been recycled into other builds A fuckin  grand pc is a car too This sub is honestly just pc memes and people flexing License plate should be RYZ  My friends would be like a car kit on a corolla while Id say mine is a  gtr premium Only spent  I know such a peasant Lol so true I remember when I was running an old sparkle power gpu with no fan on it Had to run my box fan next to the open PC case so it wouldnt over heat I remember playing wc and hexen and shit on it And then all my friends got into ddo and I couldnt play it even on low settings Good times Hol up this is an epic rfoundthemobileuser moment Meanwhile old computers would be like Its not much but its mine tried to upload an old car image but forgot Reddit isnt Chan Following this comparison Im truckin down the road with four flat tires and my doors missing I mean Im moving but not in style or comfort rbuildapc be like So its not really Huracan its a kit car Its a lengthened Fiero chassis with an aluminum and fiberglass body made of  individual laser cut pieces made to be a  exact copy of the real thing The engine is a  rotor twin turbo wankel I built from scratch in my shed The seats are real hand stitched leather long story short my buddy Keith runs a dairy farm and old Bessie broke a leg It took me just over a year to put together over a few lazy afternoons xB I dont know very much about cars though really anyone could do this could someone with some experience tell me what they think And then they make fun everyone else who didnt drive what they do Quad sli  gang You should head over to the crypto sub their firsts look similar So so many people buried themselves in debt to show off Ill never forget a mod of a Facebook PC hardware group whose wife posted their total debtcredit card statements and hour after he posted a rig setup to show off his new curved monitor Same as my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars ROFL Personally I worked up to that level but some people just save up their money specifically so they can go allout on their first go round I cant say I blame them Ayy Melbourne Actually it would be like this httpsiytimgcomviLnPInsWsmaxresdefaultjpghttpsiytimgcomviLnPInsWsmaxresdefaultjpg Legit thought it was the batmobile lol Ooo this is sadly a very true thing  rPCMR is the definition of mommys debit Thats a prebuilt you newb real PCMR assemble their own cars from parts Vic Australia rep peeps  SupercarsLuxury cars  Alienware SportsMuscle cars  Prebuilts Tuners  SelfbuiltsCustomised prebuilts Definitely I run a core i k gb ddr ram and a gtx  Its not the most powerful but it can run most games I play at high setting fps pretty well A high end pc doesnt cost as much as an exotic car and not everyone is going to be bargain hunting for their first pc Especially the people moving from either a console or a mac to a pc People have money saved up or simple more assets or earning potential than others I mean this is rpcmasterrace not rbudgetmasterrace This sub should be more the place to post flagship exotic builds than a general run of the mill Why is there so much hate for high end builds as the first build If they want a high end build that will last longer than a low end one then let them You get envious not jealous Should have been a koenigsegg as it stands we only have like a  in this car build equivalent Heres lil ol me with a gtxti gb of ddr ram unusual number i know and a amd ak with a stock cooler thats probably going to melt off of the motherboard at some point and burn a hole through my PC and desk This shit always hurts me My first build was  Pure function over looks Second build is more flashy and certainly nicer but damn im not made of money I still remember changing from Windows vista to  on my family computer and I couldnt find the sound settings So I called my dad up in the middle work to help me I dont think Ill ever forget that now I have a job as an IT tech That thing had a k GB of ram on a bit OS because apparently printers and other software my dad used needed bit os and then he got a GTS  yes that so I could do my gaming My first PC  and x upgraded to x and Strix  Not much but it works Hey Im right there with you my first build was a Radeon HD  i  with G ram and no real bells and whistles but it ran Skyrim at somewhat High  ultra and that was what I wanted Is that a Lambo from that Brazil shop needs more glowy toy car lights Two things about this post  Technically it breaks rediquette It asks for upvotes even if indirectly which

Things are way too watered down these days with uefi and gui based biosBack in our time this was the shiz Usually when I see this I have done something terribly wrong like not putting the HSF directly

Exceeded Nice one OP Usually I had around sec to clean some of the mess in my room But then come the SSD never see the colour of the floor tiles ever again Edit  its a Nvme pcie SSD So yeahh Probably wasnt using Windows  Looking forward to this tbh built a new pc last night with a m  SSD Old pc only had a  rpm hdd so itll be quite a difference Id imagine You dont even get to blink with a NVME Nice that the computer is useable once you see the taskbar on the HDD the taskbar was sign you were nearing finish with just annoying programs needing to still open Every couple years I build a new rig Each time Ive got the blazinest fastest storage I can lay hand on Used to be k rpm drives Then SSD Now NVMe Each time I think finally Im going to have a computer that boots super fast Each time Im disappointed Turns out its not the storage thats my problem its that I keep picking an ASUS mobo Even with quick POST enabled theyre slow as hell POST takes at least x longer than the actual boot At least now I know whats going on Edit  wow lots of responses to this Today I used a stopwatch to get actual numbers s from power on to handoff to the windows boot loader s from windows boot loader to login screen This is on an Asus Maxumus XI Code I have a s delay to be able to hit Del but a drop from s to s isnt really what Im after Yes Im in UEFI mode and yes Im on GPT Fast Boot is enabled The best part isnt how fast it boots to desktop its how once you boot to desktop your computer is  ready to use With HDD getting to desktop didnt take much more time but once you were on desktop it took a while before you could actually use your computer especially if you were using an old shitty name brand PC I still have or my mom does have this old Dell from  never reformatted never cleaned I played BF on it I played Command and Conquer Renegade on it I had to use it the other day because I simply couldnt get my computer to print even after trying everything I turned it on and it took about  mins before I could actually start using the damn thing My mom doesnt use it anymore or else Id build her a new one but her laptop is an old MacBook Pro and its not much better at this point But getting old people to consent to getting a new computer is damn near impossible because they assume they will lose everything Naw the first SSDs were a bit faster but they still hit the SATA mbs limit that HDDs were hitting as well Wasnt until we got faster SATA interfaces with higher throughput that SSDs really shined Were there operating system RAMDISKs he l Edit YES Prior to SSDs you could buy hardware RAMDISKs basically an array of dedicated ram that would stay powered on and keep your OS loaded into them so that at boot time the OS would already be in RAM If your RAMDISK ever loses power you need to give it time to reload its contents from its backup but this was basically SSDs before SSDs So this was always a thing you just couldnt afford it  for one in the early s Kommmwwwww eewwexcnn ycmnojkmmlllollllp It reminds me of running FTP music servers on AOL with kbps transfer speeds being optimistic all my freinds are like dont get it its to expensive but i want this i NEED this Should be a Linux logo This was me back in  when I got my first ssd SanDisk Ultra Plus gb and was blown away Was using a RAID  of  gb rpm drives before that and thought that was quick but the SSD blew it out of the water Its like going from hz to hzhz for the first time Or going from  to ultrawide you can never go back Console gamers getting excited for ssds in the next gen consoles are fucking hilarious making a big deal out of it Im like welcome to  guys Until it died for not having trim support I spent the st hour just turning it off and on again Lets talk about those M PCIE NAND SSDs thooo I dont even have a graphics card  When I first moved from hdd to ssd in  it felt blasphemous How can a mere filthy mortal such as myself have so much speed Its was an incredible experience Now of course it pisses me off if it takes longer than  seconds Can someone please link a guide to move boot from HDD to SSD Besides Macrium Thats a dream for me  my reaction when I built my pc this year My buddy installed one in his ps  told me load times were faster I was like yeah yeah Man ssds are amazing  I need to a m now Meanwhile Im still booting my PC from a  years old HDD I have no idea where this meme first came from but I fucking love it I worked for the Storage Technologies Group at Intel back when we were working on the first SSDs that were developed there httpsenwikipediaorgwikiXM It was insanely cool seeing how much faster things were Nice You want fast boot Even on a SATA SSD Whack on a light Linux distro Even heavy ones like Ubuntu have an init time of less than three seconds And my  years HDD gets me to the desktop in blazing  minutes I remember when I first install Windows  on my NVMe pcie SSD I went downstairs to have a drink and when I got back its already boot up to desktop Drew would approve Cant even go to BIOS settings because my PC boots way too fast Yeah my first one I was like itll be an improvement but not that fa Shit is it loaded already I used to have an HDD switched to an SSD Wasnt absolutely sure if it worked until I rebooted Damn I counted and its a second boot and my Crosshair VI hero takes as long to post as my  medion laptop with an ssd takes to boot Gonna get a new pc next week I never used ssd before so gotta feel it linux actually boots faster then windows even on a hdd Agree I have a crucial p gen  m nvme ssd Man my SSD is only a M SATA and I was surprised by how fast it boot Even when UEFI  Secure boot disabled its still quicker than my previous system by ages Heaven Haha when my cousin built his first PC I told him I rebooted it to install drivers and hit the button he commented itll take to long and he will do it later cause hes tired and just started at the already rebooted PC I had to inform him in the  seconds he looked up from his phone his PC already rebooted and he was blown away Shits fast af bro Takes me  seconds to boot oh hell yeah In my future build I wanna have more SSDs then HDs currently I just have on of each Dude I recently upgraded to an ssd and my friend with one always told me it was fast never really thought it was too fast until I restarted my pc turned away for a second and it was on the main screen haha I miss ssd Inused to have one in my laptop Now to save money And due to a tight budget I had to give up on ssd for my build Helped my brother set up his PC and he has an SSD I knew SSDs were fast but holy shit Me with my RAID  NVMe rig going from a RPM HDD The new mb cache WD black is pretty damn fast I was going to get optane of m but honestly its been holding up Actually not that true First ssd drives were not much faster that hdd because of the slow sata interface but responsiveness of the system was much better For some reason or another it takes my computer  ish seconds to boot from being powered off Its running a  evo nvme ssd as the boot drive too Made the switch from HDDs to M SSDs in my office at the end of last year Now users reboot so fast they dont believe they actually rebooted my tv takes longer to turn on than my pc does to boot so when my tv turns on windows is already at the login screen Real nwords still be using Raid  I remember that I looked at cards where you could put a bunch of fast compact flash card to make some king of hobossd httpswwwtheregistercoukraidonraidssd Lel i purchased my first tb SSD this year Dont forget to clean your computer when you add the ssd Weve gone plaid It really do be like that Tea I upgraded the hard drive on this inexpensive Dell gaming laptop and it went from full shut off to being at the desktop after entering in my password and with Chrome fully loaded in  seconds It used to take no lie a good two and half minutes with the factory hard drive with a looooot of janky performance along the way Replacing a hard drive with an SSD is the main thing I recommend all my friends do to their computers My friend is a streamer and somehow didnt get an SSD in his prebuild He got it built by pros after he picked the parts and they didnt recommend an SSD I then built my PC and went from  minutes from pressing the power button to being able to search something in a web browser or load windows explorer to watching youtube in  seconds I told him to get an SSD as it will change his life he didnt believe it said it couldnt be THAT good Then he started growing faster and got a few big donations so he went out and got an SSD Day fucking one of him installing it Dude this is insane my PC turns on in like  seconds why didnt I get one sooner To anyone who DOESNT have one you actually need to get one ASAP get a  SSD for Windows and your basic ass programs you use daily it will change your life wow  second faster Nah he was more in the lines of meh its not bad We had Ram disks which use ram as storage memory before flash SSD and they were much faster but problem with them is price Honestly surprised that so many of you guys are jumping on the SSD train just now With all the RGB bling bling and  bucks graphic cards I see here every day I thought most of this sub would be on SSDs for ten years now Obviously excluding older low cost builds Wouldnt this reaction apply to anyone whos just switched from an HDD to an SSD Ive gone from a hand me down  RPM to a M  Pro I was shook Thats me every time I boot my PC lol When I first booted my pc I had Linux Fuck me for not keeping it I remember that time when SSDs where super new and expensive It was Windows XPtime and it was super amazing that the Loadingscreen of Windows XP did just flash for like  Seconds and the Loadingbar didnt even show up Mind was blown Can confirm with my celeron N laptop coupled with samsung sata ssd fast boot disabled jokes on you it takes forever for me to post so i dont get that enjoyment anymore He wasnt using Win  thats for sure OH FUCK THOSE EYES ARE GONNA MAKE ME COOM OOOHHH AAAHH EEEEEHH IM GU GU GU GONNA COOM AAAAAAHHHHHH IM COOOOOOOOOOMING Even if you have a harddisk You dont even need to see the boot screen if you put your PC on sleep or hibernation if you are not leaving your pc any time soon xB Restarts are only on big updates and installationsremoval of softwaregames Still waiting for this meme format to die  Closely followed by  minutes of were just getting you set up bullshit I screamed when it booted up the first time Should we even buy the old hard drives with the platters at this point Seriously I am curious if I should What a time to be alive I remember when the first GB SSD upgrade cost  and was barely faster than a regular HDD but at least had no mechanical parts Unfortunately early SSDs had extremely unreliable controllers which impacted the speed after a while My first GB SSD cost around d  and is nowhere as fast as it used to be But nowadays you can get a TB SSD for  and we will soon get TBTBTB SSDs which will become cheaper over time than their HDD counterparts which max out at TB and are hitting limits Even the next generation of consoles will finally be able to use SSDs as the regular storage option because the prices are finally low enough Mine used to boot in  seconds with m nvme gb samsung  but for some reason its now slowed to about  seconds Will have to do a bootrace to see if can find the problem Does flash storage slow down over time Drive is less than half full is it possible to install an SDD in a Nvidia laptop External Wasnt the first to boot my PC with an SSD but when I did Windows  wasnt even a thing yet forget about W My pc takes like  minutes to boot luckily im getting an ssd this weekend Getting a computer that boots in less than  seconds is honestly one of the few highlights of my life Still waiting for this moment almost have a laptop just need to insert an SSD into it after that I just upgraded to ssd and I can confirm it is amazing having your windows boot up in  s You never forget your first SSD When you upgrade from a HDD to a SSD and moreover a NVMe you made yourself dependant to them because the improvement is so huge that every computer without and SSD feels like a machine fueled from potatoes By far the bes investment you can do for a PC AD Switched to SSD on my old and new PC  will recommend SSDs are a GAWDSEND Its basiccally everyone who first used an ssd Well no  SSDs predate Win  ITT People trying to use logic and facts to beat a quality meme You have no power here Sweet summer child Thats not a Windows Vista bootscreen  I am speed What if he has to input a password another log in method     I got a new pc and its gonna come in a few days been with a laptop all my life  Im  and the laptop is from  so yeah all my life basically  And im finally getting an around  PC so excited Now my drive falls asleep and constantly has to boot back up for up to  seconds Unfortunately there are no options to disable this Literally me cannot wait to experience this Im a few months away from being able to build my PC which Ive been desperate to do for ages How come my barracuda tb ssd is so slow  I turned on fastboot and I dont even see the loading circle anymore its like magic Lmao my pc when freshly built was  me and my father were both just in shock lol sorcery I got a ssd back in  The weird thing is sometimes it takes  secnds sometimes  minutws to boot windows I bet Linux on a NVMe SSD would be WAY faster I remember a time where I came home from school started my pc and went to the toilet Took my time there came back and it was still loading a few seconds Can anyone help me I have an Asus Hero VIII on the latest bios and Im using a Ryzen x Im using a Samsung Evo ssd and on my old machine windows would boot in around  seconds Now with the new hardware and a new install of windows  btw it takes like  seconds to boot to windows Most of it is post I appreciate the hardware checks but with such new hardware Id like it to be at least as fast booting as the old one Regular SSD not so much M SSD yes I dont even see the windows logo Bigbarain memee The goal is to have it so fast where you barely have enough time to press f I have an ssd  intel optane took me a while to realize my pc was restarting when i pressed the button on my case because it was so goddamn fast I remember back in the day I used to be able to go to the washroom and grab a snack Damn this meme is making a right come back isnt it Google be like  oR lEsS BoOt uP People have been running Linux off ram drives for a long time before SSDs came out Its not even that fast Yoo you think there were no ssds before windows  That was me  days ago First time owning ssd Never going back again First system I built with an SSD was a Pentium III Windows  build with a GB or so IDE SSD that looked like a large Gameboy Advance cartridge Ive been using SSDs ever since It still floors me I am sad that I have a password so I interrupt it with a pin entry Hey the boot icon changed Thats how I felt in like  or so when I installed windows xp on a raid array for the first time and was back on TeamSpeak in under  minutes None of my guys believed I had actually reinstalled that quickly I used to press the power button go take a piss and grab the juice from fridge and some snacks and be seated comfortably and then the pc boots up Now i have to do all that stuff before pressing the power button it boots up in the time i get cozy seating position One weird thing Im experiencing with playing crossplatform games with my friends who are over on Xbox is that every time I need to restart my PC its a workstation so a lot of the time Ive spent the day crashing the GPU and smashing the crap out of memory they all complain and moan then  seconds later Im back and theyre still asking when am I going to be gone to restart the PC My PC has some problem where the screen doesnt turn on until I hard reset I think its the display port cable Yuh my first SSD experience I couldnt quite believe it Went from boot straight to user sign in When its waking from sleep its up and firing well before the screen wakes up Next blink is blue screen crash What are the best NVMEs available My benchmarks were How fast can I get back into WoW under various disaster scenarios I was quite happy when the answer was  seconds on a BSoD So i have  hdds should i get a ssd too or more ram lol Legacy BIOS With UEFI you dont even see the Windows load screen Mine just died yesterday so Im back to Slow Boi I dont even see the first small Windows Logo booting of an Samsung  pro This almost belongs in rantimeme It still feels like that every time My face literally when I installed my first ssd aMaZoNcOmSsD My friend doesnt believe in SSDs Idk what that means but its somethin I watched a video not too long ago that was comparing boot speeds and game loading screens on HDD SSD NVMe SSD And the conclusion was that the SSD and the NVMe were almost identical in speeds  with the SSD pulling ahead of the NVMe by  seconds Ive got all my games installed on a Evo  And the games seems to load seriously almost instantly Whereas the SSD was very fast but not nearly as fast as the NVMe And here I am stuck with  HDDs due to a tight budget At least Im used to the loading times Does anyone remember this httpsyoutubeeULFfFRi The first time is always an emotion  It was at least windows  or earlier brah Just got myself an M Changed my life m nvme baby I mean the first SSD wasnt even fast My OS SSD died recently and Ive had to reinstall onto a WD Caviar Blue and its like watching paint dry Cant wait for my new one to arrive and Ill be out of this spinning icon of perpetual nightmares It was back in the windows  times so this meme is inaccurate So recently my grandfather passed and I am the only grandchild who has well taken the time to enjoy electronics like he does He even has the same sound bar for his machine as I do for my TV in the living room wasnt really the cheapest There was his main and my grandmas main  towers down stairs as well as a laptop Not a single SSD in the house Completely blew my mind Cheapest upgrade for the most noticable change and it just left me perplexed Kinda felt bad in a way took forever to get the pcs going to see what was on them I have a kingston a as my os drive Takes around  to  seconds for my lock screen to appear My Solus distribution boots faster when running HDD than Windows running SSD Now imagine how fast it will boot if I burn it to SSD Shocking This also applies to games since some boot faster on my ssd SSD is a boon to mankind A SSD is a blessing OS starts around  sec when my old PC is was around  secs How often do you need to replace an ssd For reals tho Jumping from a core  duo with a rpm boot drive  minutes till the desktop isnt too laggy to use to a X with an SX Pro was laughable I get booted in the snap of a finger now I always like the Spongebob Wanna see me do it again meme for this Last night I had to do a few restarts for updates and it really took me no time at all i dont get it bcuz i cant afford an ssd  For me this hit home when I went to install Windows on it I had done dozens of builds with Windows XP and installation takes about an hour When I did my first install on an SSD it finished in about  minutes and I was so surprised I thought something had failed This was me last march when I built my first PC I didnt fully comprehend what my buddy had explained to me I knew about HDD but no idea about SSD other than its better than HDD when it first loaded I thought I broke something and it wasnt loading right Ha ha that was me when i booted yesterday But why turn of the pc instead of using sleep mode Sleep mode takes like  to  w probably less on newer systems  Early SSDs werent that good I had one until recently and it was like MBps read speeds Theyre sooo much faster now especially the nvme ones When my baby was brand new and nothing on it she was instant Still pretty damn quick must take no more than  seconds from pressing the on button to seeing my desktop I just got an ssd and installed Windows That was me Lmao I just got an m nvme and my computer boots Soo fast now Im launching programs in  seconds Its amazing Half or more of that time is the BIOS loading I just remember how fast the first clean install on my SSD How about that M life Yeah theyre amazing My new gaming PC build is going to be all ssd storage I will never ever forget the first time Intel Gb I got from doing some Intel eLearning deal had never even seen an SSD in real life before I bet I shut down and rebooted my computer fifteen times Funny this should pop up Ive been using an old gb Seagate  rpm drive for  years if it aint broke dont fix it its still not broken and is a champ Figured with the prices dropping it would be a good time to upgrade Decided on a Sabrent NVME and I almost wept at how fast it was in comparison All those years waiting for HDD to stop RW wasted  although I have a cheap SSD it is fast as hell but boot time isnt much better than my TB drive that is  MBs I hear people talk about their ssd computer starting in  seconds or something so I timed mine its just over  seconds but man it still feels fast to me still way better than conventional HDD startups a ssd will breath new life to that old laptop in your closet What is this meme format called Actually bit computers often had their systems build in ROM so those were up as soon as you turned them on Running a nvme ssd but I have a raid cars too so it takes forever to boot the raid card and pick up all the drives At least my desktop gets turned off like once a month max I used to get home from work turn on the PC change clothes go to the bathroom preheat the oven for dinner come back to the PC and the login screen was still not up Now I do the same thing and before I can get my work clothes off its ready Same thing for games I used to do a little exercise or something semi productive during RPG load times now I dont even have time to read the damn tips on loading screens lol Honestly the part that bottlenecks my boot speed is my monitor By the time my monitor boots up my pc is already waiting for me SSDs are the truth Smh mine doesnt even show the loading wheel or whatever its called Best  ever spent Get a VR headset and youll clean your room to have play space for Skyrim unless you bought Aorus Elite x motherboard with M PCIE SSD that boots  times slower than your old AsRock P Pro  with Sata SSD And Im sitting here taking only  second to boot up windows This satisfies me when thanos gets the final infinity stone What magic is this This is like Tony Stark gearing up to become Iron Man level of cool What mouse is it wait why would you not use the  button attachment no man should have this much power roddlysatisfying That is both really cool and really useless at the same time Edit Okay okay I get it you can swap different panels like that If it wasnt for the build quality of Razers products I might have enjoyed this So how is that mouse Ive been looking at it and the G I kinda like the buttons for this one Razer Naga trinity I have this mouse It sucks The side buttons just randomly stop working and I have to pull the magnet side off and plop it back on And now on of the top backforth buttons work like half the time Ive had it since December Honestly I just wish they would bring back the Hexscrew the magnet stuff magic This mouse would be awesome but I broke like  razer nagas in the past and am currently using a corsair scimitar mouse thats barely hanging on love how the razer logo just appears razer sucks ass btw it will break  year after warranty is over star craft voice Upgrade complete  Nut achieved AvengersAssemble My proudest fap roddlysatsifying Wow Magnets Modern day Tesla over here Oh god how much does that thing cost I dont even want to know lol probably way more than I can afford uVredditDownloader Tony Stark approves I hear a lot of flack for Razer when it comes to their peripherals But I have to say this is pretty awesome Is the software Razer has for setting their mice up any good I have an old deathstalker keyboard I still use but I use a steelseries mouse because the software my keyboard had was really awful at the timethinking  Ive long since uninstalled the program I have my own gripes with steelseriess software now and I wonder if any of the other brands of manybutton gaming mice are really user friendly Naga trinity Ive had  razer mice over the past  years and ALL OF THEM developed a double left click problem And a razer blackwidow tournament with green switches developed key chattering The switches razer use are absolute shit and the build quality of their products materials plastics fitting of the product parts has also gone to shit the razer naga  edition is far superior to the  and  models build wise They do have a knack for cool designs though Netflix theme sound needed This is not impressive at all Every Razer mouse ive ever owned has broken too Its Razor so I cant Naga trinity  any other mouse Its like the leviathan axe from gow but A mouse bruh i have the same mouse Someone else who has the Naga Trinity thor summons stormbreaker during the conversation between the avengers and captain marvel Damn If Corsair could combine the weight of the M with the comfort of the Scimitar and give it the modularity this one has that would be awesome Should this not be on Prnhub Thats so satisfying This is some Iron Man type of gaming Its like that last infinity stone to the infinity gauntlet My favorite mouse ive been thinking about getting the Naga treo since my Naga hex v is legacy supported is the hex attachment as reliable as the hex model I need it  But why would anyone want an RGB mousepad with a big lip to catch your mouse cable on Neat Now where is my left handed model Crys left handed gamer tears wait i have the same mouse and didnt know you could do that Thats pretty IronMan ad I audibly groaned MAXIMUM ARMOR NGL I now need a change of pants Stark technologies wants a word Not sure why Razer gets hate I have their firefly mat naga mouse black widow board and there NZXT sponsored case Couldnt be happier But this snap on mouse is great because to be honest I use maybe  of the  side mouse buttons And interchangeable option like this would rock Iron Man Avengers theme song blasts through speakers And I am Iron Man Holy fuck Ha weak my mouse has  extra buttons feel the power of ultra Well additional buttons Add the Avengers theme Enjoy synapse  I have the raer naga hex v I had to replace it cus it was very stuttery my new mouse is way smoother not sure what went wrong Great hardwarebut fuuuuuuck their software Why I hear a starting car voice Very nice while I think that this would be a useful feature for some people it would have to be with a different brand as I have had bad experiences with their nice breaking after about a year I am IronMouse The lack of avengers music here is depressing This some kind of iron man tech I have no need for this mouse but I want it givvvvvv gifffv giveee mehhh It needs that sound effect Just needs the thx theme Technology is getting too advanced How much does this mouse weigh Alright how many comments will I have to read before BuT RaZeR Is TrAsH I oNlY GaMe CoRSaIR Edit Suprisingly a lot they are just all at the bottom They exist though Damn Maliwan is making gaming mice now Doing this when I get home I have a G and it has magnetically attached side buttons i always fidget with them when i watch Youtube Welcome to the power of magnets I was watching and it looked like the piece wasnt going to fit and I was about to scroll down because I cant handle that stress right now until I saw it slide in and I was so satisfied and my stress has washed away I do this all the time with my mouse Why my pp so hard  May force be with you How do you like this mouse compared to the nonremovable I have a  key naga that I love still a razer product tho Never again I came Oooh nice You have the Razer Cavalier this guy doesnt fuck Imagine a Razer Naga at  grams with  slightly bigger buttons instead of  small buttons Perfection Immeadiately thought of the bit of the Robot Chicken intro where it goes Its Alive Razerhttpswwwredpeppercougwpcontentuploadsbloodgif NANI Just more parts to breakit is Razer after allQuantity  RGB  quality aah so this is the nerds toy The sound and image that played in my head is the sound of when thor calls for his hammer Perfectly balanced as all things should be The last infinity stone is added to the RAZR gauntlet Link to buy this beauty This fixes a nonexistent problem Cool Cool advertisement for razor Oh look another gimmicky razer product that costs twice as much as it should bruhhttpsiredditbsoiefjpg Does anyone else see the numbers on the separate piece  to  like wtf Stop I can only get so erect Fuck thats hot I an inevitable Oh my god Im just subbed here ti admire all these gadgets because i personally cant afford all these glorious things Why has it got the Isle of Man symbol on it dun dunnnnn inches closer I am iron man And I am Iron Man I think I just came a b s o l u t e l y m e s m e r i z i n g Omg I have that mouse the razer naga trinity Its cool but fuck razer Transformer This guy just got k upvotes for inversed mouse penetration So fucking sexy unfortunate that that mouse probably weighs like  lbs I LOST I am Iron Man Wow what a reason to buy a mouse from a company whose software fucks ur entire experience I have this mouse But I use the  number pad attachment instead Didnt like how the wheel isnt  or whatever it is all the way around and goes like  Ironman mouse I did Tony Stark putting on his Iron Man suit Why does the Ghostbusters pack turn on sound come to mind whoever designed this impractical feature understands me This gave me chills This is made for people who dont want to share with their siblings just take that piece and the mouse is useless Its a Razer So this works maybe  times before it breaks Just did this with mine Worth it Satisfying as fk My razer mouse kinda pisses me off I have to be signed into the desktop app to adjust any settings The razer cortez keeps asking for permission to change settings on my device every time I turn my computer on Some times the mouse sensitivity just jumps up to a whopping adderall speed when I just want to keep it at  I like the lights on it tho What mouse is this Ugh Can you repost with the twelve keys Hey i have this mouse i fucking love the different attachments I had a naga D When the mouse is together order is restored unto the universe Great now I need to change my pants Damn I dont know why I didnt think to post this I have the trinity and do this allthetime I have an LG G and have been considering this mouse Anyone with experience with both mice have any feedback i came i was trying to do noFap thanks OP shakes fist This looks like the completed infinity gauntlet Reminds me of Samus getting an upgrade in Super Metroid Fitting in your first infinity stone is always exciting AUTOBOTS ROLL OUT Not bad Which Transformer is this Irrelivent architecture when you accept monitization This is freakin PSYONIC how many meggerbites is it Aliens are here  I need a napkin Indeed I enjoyed this You know them moments when you see something and youre like oh shit I need that now This is one of those moments That is magnificent Shit started having loose clicks within  weeks The quality has improved they said Razer mice are alright now they said Tell you what I mistreated my   Asus mouse for years and it still works just fine Not buying another Razer mouse  why be removable anyway because I can My razor mouse has lasted me almost a decade Great tech Thank you I did enjoy that Learn about

hilarious thing Ive ever seen Edit Yes Yes it is Also my most upvoted thing ever is laughing at barack obama dissing himself Cant anybody submit any comment as many times as they want under any name Lmao what were they thinking impersonating Obama this needs to go to rall this is worldwide news level shit So I randomly searched for people I know on there One guy I know is on there for  comments  for his current address past  yrs and  for his past address atleast  yrs ago What does he do to fix this I havent asked him yet since its too late tonight but I HIGHLY doubt he did this Bill Gates too httpswwwfccgovecfsfiling Please let Obama acknowledge this and call the FCC out on their bullshit Address  Pennsylvania Ave NW I fucking wish httpswwwfccgovecfsfiling Got one from Michelle Why are all the fake FCC comments look like they were written directly from Ajit pie  unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet  smothering innovation  damaging the American economy  obstructing job creation  end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan lighttouch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than  years  The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obamas Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet for everyone No real human writes like this How can millions of comments all say the exact same regurgitated paishit like this and not be seen as being fake Is there any way to know that this wasnt added by a troll and was actually added by a bot I love how it goes to say that the removal of Title II will allow the internet to flourish like it did for  years Yeah okay this was before streaming online gaming and social media were staples in American culture Also practically before boradband was even accessable to many parts of the country Lol Im dying because dialup was a great innovation but we all know the short comings Copper and fiber were crazy expensive as well wowthats justwowim even angrier than i was before how did they not implement a check for that  this assumes the last name variable is lname and the bot is written in C if lnamecompareObama    abort  here you go FCC fixed your bot httparchiveisAqP in case it disappears archive linkhttparchiveisAqP Ajit has internet if you have coin rObamaCriticizesObama Wow what a joke Its so disgusting yet you cant help but laugh at how absurd it is to have Barack Obama complaining about his own administration rnottheonion waiting for the comment from Abraham Lincoln What proof is there that this wasnt some troll Can I go on the site and put any nameaddress Edit Dont downvote me please Im asking a good question that other people will have You want people to see my comment so theyll see the responses to it and feel more assured the way Ill feel more assured I dont understand whats so important about this can some ELI I know about net neutrality but what are these filings Reading the comments all Ive pieced together is a bot went through a list of names and then This I dont live in the US so I know the basics of net neutrality but I also dont know why this was posted here in rpcmasterrace Ok so what would stop someone like myself from doing this to frame the FCC I know that the FCC faked thousands of comments but couldnt anybody leave a comment and sign off as BarryO Heres a question Of all the comments that have been submitted what percentage are this stupid copypaste comment I cant believe this is happening in real life lmao Fucking government is trash This whole thing is an embarrassment Oh man I cant wait to see what Colbert has to say to this Hahah his address is listed at the White House months after he left office This fake comment in favor of ending net neutrality needs to be investigated deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk Maybe a dumb question but what exactly does this prove How does this finger the FCC Could not any user make a phony account using a false identity Like making multiple reddit accounts for instance  This has to be a false flag because I cant believe anyone would do this shit HAHAHA fucking wow This is blatant comment fraud and no one in power seems to give a flying fuck Hey its me your president Watching all this from the UK How the FCC hasnt been disbanded by now is totally beyond me There are so many overt fake comments in support or the ending of NN and theres literal lists of the bribes received by certain governors to vote for ending it Like I cannot fathom how people like that still have a career This sort of thing is super scary its authoritarian af and sounds more like it should belong in North Korea not the US can someone simply explain to nonnatives what does that mean May  when the comment was submitted coincides with the dayhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqMayFCCfakecommentsoqMayFCCfakecomments the story about alleged fake comments in the FCC system broke It seems to me like someone trying to be funny or with an agenda to push purposefully spammed a few funny blatantly obvious fake comments into the system when the story broke Theres still a story here about how easy it is to submit fake comments but Id bet my Internet connection this particular Obama comment was actually submitted by someone whos proNN You would think impersonating a federal officer would be a crime or something Lmao this is some next level shit Honestly if they come away with this I dont want to see any USamerican talking about their freedom and democracy because this shows PUBLICLY that youre ruled by a bunch of assholes that dont even try to hide it anymore Not to go against the hate train but theoretically couldnt I go on the website and entering all those details including pretending to be Obama make that comment So you guys think this isnt just plain trolling Because it pretty clearly is OP couldve entered this for all we know Yall can sit around and beat each others dicks until theyre purple all you want just be sure youre doing it over something factual instead of something thats pretty clearly fake Upvoted to help this get to rall Or was he Lmfao has the address of the White House and everything Dammit not again What does this mean exactly for net neutrality This is amazing and wonderful Not the identity theft but the fact that its so obvious which means something will probably be done about it Barry say it aint so Archived May rd httparchiveisAqP Okay this cannot be legal Is it a felony to impersonate a former president of the USA like this I sure hope it is This whole thing has been a fucking sham and Im just amazed that everyone in a suit just rolled with it Our system is fucked up The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan lighttouch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than  years The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obamas Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet

owning a computer or cell phone Thanks Obamahttpspicsmemearigatouobamasanpng Ajit Pai is going to get burnt Thanks Obama This wont end well Ajit not for you anyway im barrack obama can someone now make a thread that obama has been impersonated on reddit Jesus Christ I thought this said imprisoned for some reason almost had a heart attack I promise you a Net Neutrality support spoofed this submission They also used Patty Duke which is a feat considering shes been dead for about a year httpstwittercomMackenzieAstinstatus Worst of all the FCC stole  million identities to make fake anti net neutrality posts they also patrol social media sites with an iron fist taking down any pro net neutrality posts and praising any anti net neutrality posts for example a lot of people have had posts taken down accounts suspended ive encountered thousands of down votes on pro net neutrality posts Ajit Pai is so corrupt and has completely abused the report system on social media sites Hey FCC Obama here let me tell you about how the Obama administration really messed up everything for the economy and innovation Obama signing out  B Obama Thanksobama Guys somebody check for Mark Hamill lol who is next George Washington This is a retarded talking point Only the Title II fanatics were obsessed with the comment system Most of these complaints are probably them creating these issues BO being created would certainly be done by them to increase entertainment and mileage robamaCriticizesObama How is this not national news I feel like most of these arent bots but people that want attention that is fucking hilarious Whoever they paid to generate all these fake comments really knows how to troll Just want to say I shared this with you all over  days ago I never mention reposts but damn k internet points Personal favorite httpswwwfccgovecfsfiling Nationalize the Internet This is Ajit Pai rubbing salt in the wound How the fuck has there been no action taken So even if Obama didnt file this we know dead are filling comments as well as people who have never visited the site So what the fuck is the hold up What can Americans do other than calling and writing letters to people who do not care about the outcome This is ridiculous and Im overly frustrated for your country I am very happy this has happened  it is a wonderful cock up that cant be ignored and now their illegal practices should be addressed completely While I hope justice is served to the corrupt people involved I cant help but wonder where they got the details of the deceased and Barack Obama from Was it supplied from a govt database with help from a political ally Bought from a private company that deals in public information Was that private company American or another country Very interesting situation it would be a great shame if these details didnt eventually come to light Loldid anyone read the description Obviously the hugest troll How does this get so many up votes Such a low effort post how is it related to this sub If no one goes to jail over this so help me God address  Pennsylvania Ave NW City Hahaha holy fucking shit this needs to spread Its like a comedy sketch

to secure a whole CRT monitor for lan parties All it needs is a flat screen in the side panel Seems like a lot of work but think of the LAN party I built my first desktop back in  when I was preparing for dorm life One of those little Shuttle systems with a Tbred  and an overclocked  Ti and a  LCD Could toss the entire setup in a suitcase for campus LAN parties I still have my thermaltake carrier from my lan party days im an old man and we used to do this for big lan parties  what a madlad Where is the foking displaaayyy Hipsters gonna Hiphttpscdntheatlanticcomstaticmtassetssciencestarbuckfullpng I bought something similar to carry SFF computer to my college class Its very handy to carry my computer instead of relying on the built in handle on the front That dude isnt skipping arm day Better bring along my keyboard and mouse Monitor Nah Im sure theyll have those there Definitely on his way to McDonalds for that free WiFi That case brings back memories Wait a second did he bring a printer cable This picture screams  I have the T case Handle included Cooler Master TrooperStryker SE users Am I a joke to you The  k child of divorce starter kit Hey dad Whats your wifi password Wheres the bloddy display OK but where is the monitor How is it gonna use it though it has no monitor I still remember the Lanboy from Antec Jesus Christ its Jason Bourne I did the same thing except I bolted monitor to the side of it I built a portable gaming PC One wire powered the monitor and the tower It has a gtx ti What makes this worse is that case was made of STEEL and plastic These days  of cases are thin aluminum But wheres the printer to go with that LPT cable mans heading to a Portland starbucks for the free wifi isnt he Why dont you ask their nm division Me with divorced parents carrying my rig between houses all throughout grade school wheres the monitor reeeeeeeeee imagine walking down the stairs landing particularly heavily with a step and you hear a crack and think about how maybe you should have mounted the gpu a little more securely  years ago I have that same carry brace years ago Let me tell you it was uncomfortable as the heavy PC will make the handle eat into your palm the strap will slowly stretch over time making the PC move around and not secure after carrying for a while and focusing the weight to just two points the stitched part near the handle it was prone to failure there Hell Yea virgin CSSC lan party Sponsored by cup noodles and Mountain dew Glad to see hes ready to plug into any printers he might find Nice monitor there Someones ready for linus tech expo No he isnt Some of the sub L SFFPCs might but still require a monitor not shown and a power outlet And a big bag I still have one of these came with my LanParty motherboard I really want to use it but my main gaming PC right now is built around a caseless concept not even a CD andor Floppy drive but a Parallel cable I had an Antec case early s that came with one of these harnesses It was great for LANparties which we still did back then bbbbut the monitor I dont see a monitor Does any one have a link for one of those holder things I actually carry my rig around a lot That thing would literally be a life saver for me My google searches came up with nothing  Cool although it could have more RGB LEDs just sayin Huh Wheres the monitor When you want to do lan with a friend who lives in another country bigass enter key on that keyboard literally unplayable Still needs a monitor I usally go to uni with that for sure I had one of those carrying straps in fact it looked exactly like that Threw it out years ago of course since LAN parties are mostly over with HEAVY BREATHING Well he was Now hes sitting somewhere with a case of hernia That would give me anxiety trying to use that I would not trust myself to not drop my build or wonder if something snaps open There are gods among us I had something like this circa  I loved it It really freed me up to carry my CRT in the other arm And drop it down the stairs RIP Going to LTX  No CRT no deal Granted couldnt the IBUYPOWER snowblind be used somewhat as an all in one Youd need to be seriously dedicated but the side panel could be used as a monitor Lmao Thats called a Gear Grip Pro and its awesome This man has a large penis DFI made a motherboard called the Lan Party NF Ultra and included one of these with it It was the most expensive motherboard I had ever bough up until then Gotta bring that parallel cable everywhere you go   would like their computer back forget the  pack of beer this is how i show up to parties from now on This is an actual thing they sell on amazon for your pc Its so useful if you go to lan events a lot Have that exact same carrying rig got it with my Alienware PC in like  Still going strong Thats cool and all but it looks heavy Tell this guy to save some pussy for the rest of us Dudes living in  If you travel with your pc at all SFF is probably the best way to go considering how nice it is being able to fit my keyboard mouse and pc into my backpack and just go Maybe carry a monitor too Ah yes this Setup can be carried straight into  Wow this brings back memories I never bought one because I was always that guy with the steel fulltower because reasons and I typically hosted the LAN parties coming through with that tower from  I actually bring a desktop to school to work on Im studying Software Engineering where working with desktop peripherals is almost a must to be comfortable My

bet hes got a really strong grip His setup surely weighs less than the old Compaq computers from the early s I suppose  years ago monitor This man is going places Is that a TURBO button I see Where do I get the straps and webbing That is not much less cumbersome than the original Tandy or Compaq portables Those old computers require a body builder to at carry them due to there case weight Just because you can does not mean that you should Dreamhack I could use this actually With an injured back its pretty difficult for me to move my monster of a rig Good old time er More portable Less heavy Then buy laptops Im too broke to even buy a mouse I still have an old computer with that case Ive been meaning to rebuild it into a gaming PC So much fucking nostalgia seeing that era of PC and KBM Amateur When i was doing LAN parties i once brough my full tower  monitor keyboard headset and so on almost km using public transport I also bend the tow rack thingy i was using to move that gear I NEED THIS Man This guy missin a monitor I still have a nicer Thermaltake branded geargrip like this I use for LANs I even used to have one for a crt monitor Yall are missing out on the fun if youre not organizing or finding local Lans I have one of those and its nice but it still isnt fun unplugging everything and carrying around monitors Probably headed to QuakeCon this weekend I saw some yo guy at the lobby in IKEA with a full monitor and desktop set up using ikeas WiFi lol Even brought his own cushion with him Gear Grip Pro where can i get this Every computer is a laptop if your strong enough At my last job I used to lug my entire desktop into work every day kept extra set of monitors keyboard and mouse at work specifically to plug in Felt as portable as a laptop because I had to plug everything into the laptop anyways additional montiors keyboard etc But when your pc weights kg Yeah its definitely very portable without monitor Aww man I spent a good  seconds trying to work out what the yellow circle was trying to point out Until he has to go grab the CRT that goes with this Loving the parallel cable Kids today laugh but having one of those was the shit in the s and early s Pulling up to LTX Lan Center I wonder what the sales are like for the company that makes the straps Is that a DB cable Where is the monitor its worth it just to tell people I have a harness for my computer Error  monitor not found Plus you get killer forearm gains Winwin Nostalgic The old cases Love them This guy LANs The Enlight   a classic case Modded a few of these back in the olden days I loved the s This is why Id love a box style pc or Alienware pc the console looking ones httpswwwamazoncomThinkGeekGearGripProLargeSizedpBUJrefsrkeywordscpustrapsqidsgatewaysrhttpswwwamazoncomThinkGeekGearGripProLargeSizedpBUJrefsrkeywordscpustrapsqidsgatewaysr I wonder if airport will count that as a carry on In what century Good old LAN parties He was proving them wrong back in  when that photo was taken But the screen Oh he is going to Remote Desktop into it with his laptop This is actually really cool Ah thats hot No optical drive Hipster Ah I used to love these kits I rember buying my DFI Lanparty motherboard and it came with a free caddy like this to take my case to events  I had a Cm Stacker So it was never going to carry it This is so  and there are no drives But is it battery powered Laptops destroyed by facts and logic This pictures so old theres a good chance that the person in it is dead This man is disrupting a  million dollar industry This guy takes minesweeper every where A relic from before the times of glass cases I remember those KSwiss Are they still a company havent heard of them in years now Mr homeless smiles Wow I had something almost like that for when my crew and I did LAN parties back in the late s I remember feeling like such a boss the white case with a turbo button a Microsoft ergonomic mouse the new style without a ball an IBM mechanical keyboard and my high top British Knights Oh and of course the tool set with an antistatic strap no one ever used I have a feeling this is a picture from back in the day and the dude carrying it is probably worried about his kids college tuition cholesterol and a receding hairlines now lol George Costanaza Is that you Forgetting about the weight of that vs that of a simple laptop No monitor Bet the dude has a RTX  In there Getting a s LAN party feel here Such beige Bet hes got techno remixes from Napster in that box Nice display  Flashbacks to multiple crosscity trips with public transportation to gather everyone to a lanparty Is there like a back pack version Wheres the screen I had one of these for LAN parties years ago I loved it A new opponent has appeared Laughs in full tower atx Find out his one weird trick the s called they want their pc back Pretty sure with my arabic name TSA would try to take it apart  I bet you feel real stupid right now We all can learn a lot from this man Wheres the monitor laughs in small form factor No monitor Basically useless Wheres the monitor Dont tell him about mini itx and portable monitors  Lets make a deal  when our responsive layout goes live in a couple weeks check it out and let me know how it feels on mobile If you still want an app then and that app can provide functionality that the responsive site cannot offline access excluded then message me and let me know what that is If theres a good use case that our responsive layout cant solve Im happy to consider it Heres what we have on our roadmap consuming time and resources that I need to weigh when evaluating its importance A mobile app isnt so much as do we or dont we but what would get delayed if we did  responsive layout been in works for well over a year and about to go live any week now will launch initially with our new cycling site that is in a private beta of sorts right now going live in a week or two  office renovation not getting cancelled major construction likely to start in a few months Permitting with the city is just about to happen While were not building it ourselves we are setting up the new studio in it which will take time fronthttpswwwinstagramcompBppjiuzDzeZ soon to be studiohttpswwwinstagramcompBnaWNxlOmo  comprehensive benchmarks integrated into part selection code infrastructure mostly done Building renovation will be setting aside a portion of space for hardware Not small  think like  systems running concurrently all day gathering loads of data with inhouse data acquisition hardware Waiting on the final word from MEP but Im  sure were going to need the power company to upgrade the amperage to our building to pull this off  on the site a better ability to place what parts go where Mixing and matching different GPU combinations Also opens the door to later configuring water cooled systems or other esoteric configurations I hope to add the ability to detect situations like when a card will run at a reduced rate like x instead of x x depending on what slot it is in and then ideally offer recommendations if theres a better configuration  other small but important features that add up like usb type c front panel support on cases website dark mode etc WOKEUPNEXTMORNINGFOLLOWUPEDIT  Once our cycling site goes out Ill look into adapting our upcoming responsive layout into a progressive web app I appreciate all the suggestions and feedback and appwise it sounds like this would make the most sense for us It would let us eventually deliver a few additional applike features while not forcing us to throw away or rewrite what we just spent the last couple years working on  also forgot to add  in the office renovation happening this summer were setting up a hemianechoic room for sound testing various equipment under load fully built systems cases case fans GPUs cpu coolers etc We brought in acoustic consultants to help spec it out Itll be a highly isolated room with a low noise floor Thisll probably be one of the last things renovationwise we get around to fleshing out But when it happens you can expect to have the acoustic profiles of parts we test to start showing up on our product pages removed PCPartPicker has replied in this thread herehttpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentsbbobbweneeeditekfzapd Heres a response from a couple days ago on rbuildapc Perhaps one day But think about it this way Us launching an app means we now have to maintain two different codebases every time we want to add a feature redo a UI layout etc And with the website if we want to change it we just do it and everyone gets the latest on the next page load But with an app now we have to maintain backwards API compatibility for any apps that people have on their phones but havent updated Also when theres a bug in the site UI I fix it and push it live sometimes in minutes For apps it can take weeks for fixes to go through the app store approval process In a nutshell an app needs to have a very compelling use case that the site doesnt solve in order to justify its considerable extra development cost EDIT We are releasing a responsive layout on PCPartPicker in the next few weeks Weve been working on it for over a year It is bringing feature parity with desktop to mobile users We chose this over an app a while back because it let us develop once for all platforms Relevant xkcd as alwayshttpsxkcdcom The site works perfectly fine for me Are you experiencing an issue The mobile site is great Make a bookmark Bam pcpartpicker app Apps are overrated make a mobile website Why should I have to use space on my freakin phone pc do what a website would Ive worked in the IT field for  years am a veteran web developer and sysadmin am wellversed in several programming languages Assembler C C SQL Python PHP JavaScript and oddly enough PostScript and to this day I dont understand why people want a mobile app over a website  Fuck no the web page works absolutely fine We dont needs apps for everything No no it does not It just needs a better mobile web page Not everything needs to be an app Fun fact Google Chrome on Mobile allows you to pin specific websites to your home screen Go to their website and pin the site to your home screen Voila You now have the app Thanks for coming to my TED Talk there is an app your browser I hate apps I wish we moved away from them Web is the best way to go We do not need it We do not want it You can use websites on your phone Why Its a website and any device that uses apps can also access the website Not every website needs a shitty web front end app Just use the website like a normal person PCP Art Picker Some dude on PCP trying to sell art Sounds like a horrible app idea Why do we need to design PCs on the go Just add a shortcut to the site on your homescreen Boom pcpartpicker app The mobile version of the website is perfectly usable No point in reinventing the wheel Or you could just use Build Coreshttpsitunesapplecomusappbuildcoresmobilepcbuildingidmt Responsible  HomeScreen Icon and its done IIRC ive read somewhere they are creating a responsible layout How often are you building a pc You build it once and youre done An app would rarely be used PPP does not need an app It would however benefit from a PWA If they MUST be on the App Store or Google Play they should just do so using a thin browser that connects to their hopefully newlyoptimized site anyway What they really need is a new UX  PWA implementation A new UX can be cleaner more modern and more userfriendly Turning it into a PWA from the users perspective means when you visit the site you have the ability to add it to your phones app drawerhome screen as if it is just another app It functions like an app it looks like one it blends in with the other ones and with the right devs and optimizations it feels just like any other native app It is a fabulous option and the people who are responsible for making PWAs as a technology come to reality are nothing short of revolutionary groundbreakers No app No multiple codebases New UX PWA support Thats it So weve gone from hating having apps for every service a few years ago to begging for it from developers when their mobile site works fine and is probably better than an app would ever be All right then Come on from this sub I would expect people to know what an app is xB PC Part Picker is an app its a web based application just like gmail or twitter Yeah I dont have any issue with the mobile version of the site Performs fine on my  yo phone Any app would just be an embedded web browser There isnt really any point Its not necessary for it to be an app Besides its just the internet On your phonehttpswwwyoutubecomembedlZMrZfoEautoplaystartend Someone probably already said you can use Chrome to add a website to your home screen in Android Then its kind of like an app The mobile site for PCPartPicker is pretty solid Naw Building a pc on a phone is the type of hypocrisy i hate Progressive Web App Previous windows phone user here Did not need apps most mobile site pages were boss Apps should die what is this mobile propaganda YOU GUYS HAVE PHONES RIGHT Honestly Id like this just for the sake of normalizing PC building amongst more broad audiences not sure how much id use it but if made simple enough i bet a few extra people could try it out of curiosity at least Why You know all theyd do is just make an app thats a web wrapper anyway Hell thats what way too many apps are these days  websites or website code running in a web renderer app Google chrome IS an app change my mind Im here from the front page and I read it as PCP Art Picker like an app to choose art where the artist was on PCP We need PhonePartPicker so we can use our brand new phones to spec out our next one Most apps these days arent even real programs but rather browser applets letting the website appear in full screen That said theres no need for it especially with prices changing this rapidly I was just using their website on my phone the other day and it worked pretty good What I would like more companies to do is make a web layout similar to how Destiny Item Tracker made a plugin type function instead of another app I have to download and update on my end They should charge for it since you ungrateful bastards are so demanding Someone is about to make millions of dollars Everybody knows that if you need help on building a pc then you need to just play pc building simulator Currently i believe that game is only on pc so dont get fooled by the rip offs in the AppStore with  star reviews Without this simulator your pc build will suck if it even works at all but without the pc you cant use the simulator So you must build a time machine and go into the future where you already have the pc done and then you can learn how to build it with the simulator Of course to avoid a paradox you must prove the multiverse theory and travel to a the future of an alternate timeline Now if you think this is a joke then take a look at steams very real  rating and tell me if they can make pc building simulator with that high of a score for  bucks why you cant bend the fabric of time and space to utilize it They need to start posting builds on their YT channel again Also they havent done much of anything on their site in terms of reviews etc in a long ass time oh im sorry i thought this was pcmasterrace not mobilemasterrace This isnt mobile master race get out What dont you have a PC No websites need a proper mobile site Unless there are features that only an app can provide a mobile site will always be the way to go Never in my life have I more disagreed with such a heavily upvoted post Get out of here with that we need an app for everything bullshit I gotta say Everything SHOULD NOT be a fucking app just make the site super mobilefriendly i honestly prefer having fewer apps and i often just use the websites instead PCP Art Picker The Finest Selection of PCP inspired artists and artworks all in one convenient app Angel Dusts the shit Do you guys not have phones yes Pcp art picker upcpartpicker Please dont make an app Im full of apps that do nothing more than the website people should know they can create a link and put on the screen to access it directly i disgreee So you people do have phones I thought that too Its not I figured most people would pc part pick while on ya know a pc Paging upcpartpicker It was fine until they took away the mobile site PWAFTW As a non PC guy on the front page I read this as PCPARTPICKER Needless to say I was quite confused I must be the only one who read this as PCP art picker and thought thats sounds like a great app Saw this on my front page and read it as PCP Art Picker I Yeah I guess I could see that as an app Have it wrapped in a webview always latest code pushes no store hoops And an offline mode too Dont condone PCP art picking enablers Nice try Blizzard I read this as pcp art picker And support for the SEA market Unrelated I was scrolling through popular and read this as pcp art picker  How often are you people doing builds Sites work fine for me This is the first step to birthing a shitty PWA Fuck apps this is so anti pcmr I cant believe it Yeah lets just have every company take whats not broken and throw in a bunch of datamining shitware with it I read this as PCP art picker and now I want an app that either lets me pick from art made by people on PCP or art that Id be more likely to enjoy while on PCP Idk about anyone else here but I initially read pcp art picker and that is an EXTREMELY different type of subreddit I disagree just cause of how much more work it is They have a mobile version dont they Not so long ago PCPartpicker stoped loaring in mobile mode though Any one of us can still make an unofficial app from the site All wed need is some good ol fashioned webscraping and api calls the site makes But it could be against their terms of service I read that as pcp art picker That sounded fun PCP art picker Well to each their own I guess Be the change uaameerrr hell yeah XD Someone already made an app version of pc part picker and literally made a hot post on this subreddit The closest thing I know of is the app BuildCores its on iOS idk about android PCP art picker should be an app Legit someone from pcpartpicker explained in detail why this is a bad idea on builds PCs within the last  hours PCP art picker would be a fun idea too Listen this isnt the idea boys n ladies We go this rout and we end up preceding what the rest of us humans do Take it use it force it and abuse it pcpartpicker should be exactly what it is today Regardless of the previous or last posts Frankly yes frankly I do not care as of what you see it to be pcpartpicker is what you all are missing Here from rall Though at first it was for an app where people sold art they made while on PCP Weeeee neeeeeeed iiiiiit Since when did websites not work on phones What is this the s Anyone in Austin want to come to their office in Round Rock and annoy them until they make an app Im out of the loop Whats pcp arts picker rfoundthemobileuser Like a windowslinux program or a mobile app Youve all got phones right why would you use a tiny little screen like a pleb if youre a part of the PC master race PCP art picker indeed good sir PCP art picker would also be a great app Yeah dont you guys have phones A half decent work around with any good mobile website is to click the  dots in chrome and select add to home screen I disagree I think it should be a mobile friendly website Apps for websites are usually surprise just shortcuts to the mobile site anyway ITT People reading it as PCP art picker Dont bash it till youve tried it Theres very little reason for them to build an app A website makes so much more sense yo i know very little python lemme help So you can build useless  budget PCs at weddings funerals family gatherings etc And stop blocking Private Internet Access too but maintain an app is a ridiculous nightmare man its seems all good and nice because it looks that way but tailoring it specifically to a phone isnt a piece of cake I was soooo shocked when I first got into pc gaming and wanted to build my pc and saw there wasnt an app How is this still a thing Imagine having such a good website that people want an app rather than having such a shitty website that people want to uninstall the app instantly PCP art picker save Great I can disappoint myself on pc and mobile now Fucking facts I just built my first rig in  years on pcpartpicker and I was surprised there wasnt an app I would download it The fuck it isnt yet It would make so much sense Too many websites have apps but this is the one website that desperately needs one Why isnt it an app lets do a petition thatll help for sure sarcasm all the way through Its PC part picker not use my phone for something that is better done on a computer or web browser Pcp art picker If I make one in adobe XD will someone buy me out Im poor af Absolutely we do forMOBILEhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaYsPHKxw Why didnt I think of that an app running exclusively on PC PCP art picker Boogers How many of you really use the site on your phone Every time Ive had to make a new build from the ground up I have a shit ton of tabs open to make sure everything is compatible and fix and using multiple tabs on mobile is cancer Plus picking out all of the parts takes time and Id rather sit at my computer for that time than wherever I am with my phone PCP art picker I see  I need to step my drugged art up Load it in a webview and put it on you phone I kind of feel like this is the sort of job I dont want to even try to do on a phone I mean I know you might have to but you should really try to borrow a laptop or something Dont you guys have computers We really do need a app Make sth such as twitter lite  PWA if app is time consuming  Thanks Indeed And thank you partpicker for helping me build my new gaming rig No because PC Part Picker gets its profits from affiliate links Harder to implementless conversion in an app Have Not really the only problem is that the mobile layout sometimes doesnt work unpopularopinion I use it on mobile using chrome and find it perfectly ok Nothing wrong with a well structured web friendly mobile site Better that than yetanotherredundantwebapp demanding unnecessary permissions on my phone I may be in the minority but I personally hate using apps when its unnecessary If mobile implementatjon is good i prefer that Pretty sure theres already apps that hook into

his tweet makes it seem like the internet has been in the slums since  and hes just trying to fix it I cant even believe how corrupt he is that he has the audacity to claim hes fixing the internet Jesus christ fuck this guy What a piece of shit Fucking corrupt Its amazing how we live in a democracy where the government is for the people by the people to the people and where our representatives are supposed to represent us but when the overwhelming majority of us tell them what we actually want we are told how we really need the opposite What is this China Hopefully my isp cant change me off the plan I am already on This is some serious bullshit tech companies need to make a serious uproar about boycotting US if they do this Can you imagine how many people would run out and vote of twitterfacebook refused to serve the US Except removed Ahhh its all good guys we can go back to the halcyon days of the internet where our biggest concern was getting our MySpace page not to crash Also Pepe will be a good guy again  YAHhttpsiimgurcomiWKadjpg Just so everyone knows these five peoplehttpswwwfccgovaboutleadership are the ones voting on the matter The three men are voting to destroy Net Neutrality while the two women are voting to uphold it Now heres an idea Im curious on how legal or illegal it would be to somehow find out the physical address of where these three people live and set up protests outside of their homes These peoplein theory work for us after all why not remind them of that while they are both on and off the clock Lets face it they wont listen if we protest in front of corporate offices or try to play by their rules but if their families have to deal with crowds of protesters right outside their front doors for days on end then maybe that will help get the message across Article he links is paywalled but heres the full text  By Ajit Pai  Nov    am ET   As millions flocked to the web for the first time in the s President Clinton and a Republican Congress decided to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet In the Telecommunications Act of  the government called for an internet unfettered by Federal or State regulation The result of that fateful decision was the greatest freemarket success story in history   Encouraged by lighttouch regulation private companies invested over  trillion in nearly two decades to build out American communications networks Without having to ask anyones permission innovators everywhere used the internets open platform to start companies that have transformed how billions of people live and work   But that changed in  Just days after a poor midterm election result President Obama publicly pressured the Federal Communications Commission to reject the longstanding consensus on a marketbased approach to the internet He instead urged the agency to impose upon internet service providers a creaky regulatory framework called Title II which was designed in the s to tame the Ma Bell telephone monopoly A few months later the FCC followed President Obamas instructions on a partyline vote I voted no but the agencys majority chose micromanagement over markets   This burdensome regulation has failed consumers and businesses alike In the two years after the FCCs decision broadband network investment dropped more than the first time a decline has happened outside of a recession If the current rules are left in place millions of Americans who are on the wrong side of the digital divide would have to wait years to get more broadband   The effect has been particularly serious for smaller internet service providers They dont have the time money or lawyers to cut through a thicket of complex rules The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association which represents small fixed wireless companies that generally operate in rural America found that more than  of its members incurred additional expense in complying with the Title II rules had delayed or reduced network expansion had delayed or reduced services and had allocated budget to comply with the rules They arent alone Other small companies have told the FCC that these regulations have forced them to cancel delay or curtail upgrades to their fiber networks   The uncertainty surrounding the FCCs onerous rules has also slowed the introduction of new services One major company reported that it put on hold a project to build out its outofhome WiFi network partly because it wasnt sure if the FCC would approve of its business model Nineteen municipal internet service providersthat is cityowned nonprofitstold the this past May that they often delay or hold off from rolling out a new feature or service because we cannot afford to deal with a potential complaint and enforcement action   This is why Im proposing today that my colleagues at the Federal Communications Commission repeal President Obamas heavyhanded internet regulations Instead the FCC simply would require internet service providers to be transparent so that consumers can buy the plan thats best for them And entrepreneurs and other small businesses would have the technical information they need to innovate The Federal Trade Commission would police ISPs protect consumers and promote competition just as it did before  Instead of being flyspecked by lawyers and bureaucrats the internet would once again thrive under engineers and entrepreneurs   The FCC will vote on this proposal on Dec  If it passes Washington will return to the bipartisan approach that made the internet what it is today Consumers will benefit from greater investment in digital infrastructure which will create jobs increase competition and lead to better faster and cheaper internet accessespecially in rural America   In the next few weeks antimarket ideologues are going to try to scare the American people Theyll argue that government control is the only way to assure a free and open internet Theyll assert that repealing utilitystyle regulation will destroy the internet as we know it and harm innovation Theyll allege that free speech online is at risk Dont fall for the fearmongering   We have proof that markets work For almost two decades the US had a free and open internet without these heavyhanded rules There was no market failure before  Americans werent living in a digital dystopia before the FCC seized power To the contrary millions enjoyed an online economy that was the envy of the world They experienced the most powerful platform ever seen for permissionless innovation and expression Next month I hope the FCC will choose to return to the commonsense policies that helped the online world transform the physical one   Mr Pai is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Have fun tearing it apart i guess Ok fuck this guy seriously But whats wrong with this tweet Hes just tweeting a link to an article he wrote What a fucking piece of shit why is this a video why not a link to the tweet andor article on archiveis deleted For everybody not listening this is literally the first step to the internet being not only subscription based but also microtransaction based open this SPEEDZ lootbox for up to MBs for the next  hours BOOOOST and then pack the RNG boxes with badgers logos and other stuff that basically does nothing removed Iget Paid the chairman of the FCC or something deleted Guys I dont know if we will THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN PAUSED DUE TO PAYMENT FAILURE He literally doesnt insinuate he didnt write it Not that I support this guy But it seems clear to me that hes just using the website to talk at length about the issue much in the way people use twitlonger when they want to say something past the tweet limit without stringing together  tweets Its Twitter after all you really cant have an intelligent conversation when youre limited to  characters Thats why donnie loves it so much he has no intelligent conversations This likely wont be seen But someone needs to make a wellresearched post specifically stating what Pai and the corrupt officials gain eg any conflicts of interest any ties to specific companies anything related to money or positions his plans Many people dont know and think it is a party issue This is a power issue  Does the power belong to the people or to the officials that the people are supposed to represent People complain that these movements arent working eg unlike the previous lootbox gambling issue where EA was easy to blame This man and his corrupt officials are set on ruining everyones lives for a quick penny he needs to understand the consequences that his life can just as easily be ruined through the power of social media BEFORE he shuts social media down We need to fill every front page nook and cranny of the internet and share all his conflicts of interests for everyone in the world to see We finally have a face to pin the antiinternet cause lets use it I think his tweet is saying I propose this repeal and this is an article I wrote about it that is a way more in depth explanation of what I just tried to say in  characters Wait at what point did he indicate he didnt write the article Also rtitlegore Direct linkhttpsvredditzmzdefxdzzDASHK  Iamabotbleepbloop Except What a terrible title This piece of shit mother fucker Alright guys I hate what Ajit Pai is doing too but have you never heard of an OpEd Opinion Editorial before Its a VERY established thing to do where you write a piece for a publication stating your own independent opinion that appears in a dedicated section of the paper just for outside opinions like this There are many reasons to hate what he is doing but sharing his own OpEd isnt one of them people who try to play the good guys like this just piss me off okayI support net neutrality but his tweet does not imply that the article is not written by him Actually the tweet seems to imply that the opinion article is his opinion Okay now I hate the antiNN crusade as much as the next guy but a government agency chief writing an oped to announce and argue for their new policy proposal is about as established a tradition as anything else This is not even remotely strange Here you have a different example also from WSJ from this summer httpswwwwsjcomarticlesintroducingmaganomics Mick Mulvaney being of course the Trump budget director Politics aside  Hes sharing an Op Ed Theres nothing wrong with his tweet Am I missing something  I might go along If ISPs didnt monopolize areas or even whole zip codes I wonder Would Twitter have been invented if net neutrality hadnt been in place Yeah sorry I dont see anything wrong with this He mentioned something in  characters and then is expanding it using an article he wrote I still think hes a piece but acting like he said Heres WSJs opinion on the subject is just wrong Its a commentary piece An opinion piece He never said it was anything other than what is is deleted Um why is it bad for him to link to an article he wrote You act like hes trying to hide behind some big mask but clearly it says his name before any of the article content not to mention it even says COMMENTARY just above the article title Are you arguing that he shouldve posted this on the FCC website or something Whats the point of this post I dont even have a stance on NN but this just seems like nonsense Ajit Pai is such a fuckin douchebag that I have a hard time understanding how he has gotten so far into the government It looks like hes talking about the article he wrote What a fucking moron Gotta love how hes saying hes working against what Obama did He just got a free every Republican in the country vote card What a fucking tool This is like citing your terrible Tumblr post for your term paper in college No you cant do that Im surely not the first but except not expect Wow this is pathetic No one wants net neutrality gone Republican or Democrat I cant believe this nutjob is still employed At least this is an issue that everyone can agree on Maybe we should start dealing with corruption the old fashion way something along the lines of France in  Its shitty that a single person can wield the power to fuck over all of America How dare that MOTHER FUCKER link an article that he wrote HIMSELF WHAT THE FUCK THIS IS AN OUTRAGE PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY LINK ARTICLES WRITTEN BY OTHER PEOPLE I cant believe this shitty post was upvoted k times The intent is to provide people with a sense of pride and accomplishment for accessing different websites As for cost we

everyone as soon and as often as we can This guy is a real piece ajit I know net neutrality is good but he makes me so hard I listen to every speech with my Ajit Pai waifu pillow I cannot hold a conversation without Ajit Pai coming up I have lost all my friends and family but I do not care I have my Ajit Pai He is my hero I have posters of him all over the wall I remember when I first saw Ajit Pai I cried and cummed at the same time seeing what I had been missing up until now in my life I dream about Ajit Pai coming up to me and personally asking me to send antiNetNeutrality comments under a false name and we doing it together naked all night My daddy Ajit is my hero I hope we can get together sometime I embellish myself in all his tweetsand do so holding my waifu of him sooo tight Does anyone know if I am alone in my desires I wonder how he feel like now for becoming ONE OF THE MOST HATED MAN ON THE INTERNET I must say thats quite an achievement XD You mean except right removed He tweeted it why should we not expect that he wrote it Um hes sharing an opinion piece he wrote on his twitter A very rare thingexpect it isnt Are you people fucking retarded Well a tweet is  characters The article is his long form reasoning Grow up guys deleted He wasnt claiming to not have wrote it I totally understand the outrage over the net neutrality decision but this isnt really an uncommon practice Ajit Pai has an argument to put forward that doesnt fit in a tweet so hes linking to his more thorough but still digestible editorial piece to explain his position Its really not that crazy Bring on the downvotes I guess If it makes you feel any better he probably didnt actually write it This whole process is literally driving me crazy First off Everyone EVERYONE is saying they are repealing the OBAMA ERA regulations Republicans are literally using his name as a staple for a non existent TERRIBLE TIME in America The whole fucking reason he and the FCCYeah a democratic FCC reclassified broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of  Was because ISPS WERE THROTTLING DATA Forcing Companies to shell out A LOT of money to keep their services active Netflix being the most notorious of this Since our entire government is literally bought and paid for and no long serves the people it rules Id say it needs a thorough and exceptionally graphic visit by The Constitutional Punisher TM And He doesnt say someone else wrote it lmao people actually upvoted this crap Is this sub full of retarded man children who are that far up their own asses they dont know how news works Yes he tweeted his own article his tweet is a preface to his article explaining his dumbasses backwards paid for opinion The government is so good at running things lets let them keep it It literally disgusts me it makes me physically ill that this man is in a position of power a position by which he is capable of enforcing judgement on the entire internet How to become the most hated man in America  by Ajit Pai On WSJ which is under a paywall Im going to repeal heavyhanded Internet regulationsby giving ISPs more power to regulate the internet Got it What is wrong with him linking to an article he wrote I dont get it The mans a twunt He is such a disgusting little shit Text resist to  and let resistbot guide you through sending faxes calling emailing and snail mailing your words to your representatives Its free and is so freaking easy Seriously try it Give your reps a fucking earful Pop pop reload I dont think he was trying to pass it off like it wasnt his writing He was just linking to an article he wrote on the matter instead of rewriting it again via twitter The man with the most punchable face on the planet strikes again But seriously I want to lock that evil fucker up in a cage with starving hyenas Nonamerican But how the Obama administration make the internet bad Isnt the same as always I did not expect he wrote that at all Shocking Before  we still never had internet fast pass packages and throttling speeds of sites youre not subscribed to This guy has the dumbest looking face Is this motherfucker from Bizarro world or something This guy is such a piece of shit Seriously Fuck This Guy Some time in the near future Welcome to Comcast landing page What would you like to do today You can   Open Comcast mail and send messages to other Comcast users crossservice fees apply for messages sent outside of network   Open Comcast Sports and watch realtime sports with commentary from your favorite Comcast anchors   Open Comcast Music and stream from a wide variety of music popular with Comcast users   Open Comcast Movies and TV and rent shows and flicks popular with Comcast users   Open your services page to add or remove options from your package LimitedTime offer add Netflix access for only   mo for the first three months Netflix monthly charge must be paid directly to Netflix Price increases to  after three

sites have paid a Comcast licensing fee for the low low price of   mo What a deal The only things that can stop that are competition and regulation If you dont have one you need the other I dont drop fbombs often but this calls for it FUCK PAI Someone needs to put this guy in a box and float him down a river except Sorry it bugged me too much not to say it He just linked to his own blog post Is that a crime now He is a complete sack of shit I hope he goes to jail for raping America Make the internet great again Seems reasonable He makes good arguments for a free market and how it has worked well in the past Did he Say that somebody else wrote it Is this dishonest in some other way that I didnt realize Is he not allowed to share his opinion in the form of a news article I legitimately dont see whats wrong with this other than what hes arguing for Wheres anonymous to find some dirt on this shit bag when you need them Is the whole internet based solely within America Why does this person say he can save the entire worlds internet by doing this Or does he only want to isolate Americas internet behind a paywall I dont see how he is saying this article supports his idea I see him saying check out what I have to say about it in this article I wrote Looking into this too far that said hes still a terrible person Hello friends Move to Canada maybe Sorry rquityourbullshit Mr Pai from one republican to another ahem fuck you what an expectional piece of shit If this passes and man I hope it does not they have NO idea how many people who voted for this shit are going to be exposed The wrath will be unlike anything we have ever seen Sex scandals dick pics offshore bank accountsif ANY of these people have ANY skeletons in their closets and I am sure they do its going to be a field day until the day they moderate the shit out of the internet Now if we ever get wind about it hell if I know I know ONE thing for certain This will run a close second to trying to take guns away from people This is not going to go away I called and emailed today Canned responses and left on hold for over  minutes during my lunch break These bastards do NOT GIVE A SHIT They are paid and fucking happy about it Thats right senator I cant wait for your ultra right wing christian ass to have your profile pic on your website set to you sucking some dude off in a shitter somewhere you arrogant fuck rtitlegore Seriously A video You couldnt just link the damn twitter you had to post a video httpspbstwimgcommediaDNGlrABUIAArROjpg This is what it looks like in Portugal without net neutrality Feel free to share spread and post this image wherever you see fit holy shit he linked to an article he wrote that is absolutely fucking insane HOLY FUCK What a piece of shit Man you guys are totally getting boned on internet If theres anything a fellow neighbouring Canadian can do let me know This is utter horseshit and only benefits the wealthy greedy ass corporations Who else would have written that article Hes the only person with that opinion Exactly how is that a problem This Fuckin guy WSJ should never have allowed this kind of article to be done by a man in his position Complete lack of ethics Ajit Pai FCC Chairman  You need to contact your representatives and senators about Net Neutrality even if they already support it but especially if they dont Remember that this very thread is only possible because of a free and open internet kill net neutralityand threads like this might be a thing of the past Easy way Step  Go to BattleForTheNetcom Step  Do what BattleForTheNetcom tells you to do The harder but still very easy way Step  Find out who your Representative and Senator isare Find your Representative Find your Senator Local elected officials Step  Find your Representative and Senators contact information callsorg has a decent repository of Representatives and Senators contact information though the site is a bit difficult to navigate Call My Congress just asks for your zip code and tells you what district you live in who your Representatives are and how to contact them DailyKos has a list of all of our Senators phone numbers not just the DC office Current as of February  FaxZero has a system set up allowing you to fax your Representatives and Senators for free Faxes are good if you cant get through on the phone lines or just if you want congressional staffers to listen to fax machine noises until Net Neutrality is safe Fax Congress Fax Senators Step  Call write or fax to express your feelings on this A lot of people are nervous about calling their elected officials for the first time maybe you dont know what to say or how to say it or even who youll be talking to so heres what youll need to know Theres a  chance your call will be answered by a Secretary who is specifically there to listen to your concerns theres a  chance your call will be bumped into a voicemail box which is specifically there to listen to your concerns there is a  chance youll find yourself on the phone with your Senator or Representative You may be asked for your name and address or zip code its okay not to tell them if you dont want to but the information is useful for your elected officials I usually just give my first name zip code and the name of my town Dont worry about a script dont worry about being eloquent youre not writing Shakespeare here youre a concerned citizen voicing their frustrations fears and hopes Im really scared of Ajit Pais plans to roll back net neutrality a free and open internet is important to me because Your reason here Some suggestions An open internet is important to democracyI worry what Donald Trump might do with more powerCable bills are already too highetc Please tell Senator or Representative that I support a free and open internet I support Net Neutrality and I vote The only hard and fast rule is that you need to be polite these folks are getting dozens if not hundreds of calls a day they dont need you bitching and swearing at them for something they have no control over Be passionate but be polite Reminder Only call YOUR OWN elected officials Calling Mitch McConnell from sunny Florida wont do anyone any good and might actually harm the cause Only call your own elected officials period Spread this information around you can click source at the bottom of the comment to see an unformatted copy of this post that you can copy and paste This is important stuff OP grossly misinterpreted Ajit Pais tweet Hes says Today Im proposing literally stating that he is the author before linking to a WSJ opinion post He just wants more than  characters to express his opinion This is beyond mundane Every politician trying to get out a message uses opeds Nobody reads the FCC to get their news so he has to use another medium as advertisement STOP UNDERMINING THE MOVEMENT WITH IMPULSIVITY There are plenty of factual things to criticize him on This only delegitimizes us and make us look like an uneducated mob Its a political football Do you guys like playing political football with your internet No Well come up with a technical solution then legislation can always be reversed Christ what an asshole Isnt that the point its his twitter hes sharing HIS work Also Time Warner Verizon Comcast and ATT are the ones writing the net neutrality laws

sooooo nice Remember shame Pepperidge Farm remembers Ajit got corrected to Shit by my autocorrect Coincidence I think not You forgot about satellite too deleted Scumbag fuck Hes just acting as excepted  fuck that guy  except This hurts my brain that someone so incompetent is in charge of a big government agency No faith in humanity Except for the anxiety I hate Fpanel tho Always gives me anxiety like Im gonna bend the pins Lego is far more difficult than pc building Pretty much is except Im pretty sure Legos are more expensive now well i mean if you really want to you can make your own PC out of indivitual chips and electronic components sure it woudnt be a modern system that can run Win or Crisis but a simple thing that can run DOS and Original DOS Software like Commander Keen Arkanoid Elite etc EDIT no i meant this as a hobbyist project ANYONE can do not working for any company which is pretty much impossible by itself plus even if you work for any company you wouldnt be able to do stuff like this Except legos dont require fuckin cable management Im new here Still no custom pc I am better off building that then my ninjago LEGO set that sits  home But if you drop one peace to the floor you could still use it Tbh soldering electronics isnt that hard either debugging a brokencold joint though can be a fucking headache True I was able to build mine with basic step by step instructions within an hour All the connections are arbitrary so it really wasnt too difficult I had this communitys help as well Yea Im always baffled by how people think putting a PC together is wizardry Almost all cables and connectors and such only fit into one slot in one way The only ones that were different for my PC were the small plugs for the power button reset button and front audioUSB ports As they were all basically the same But instead each plug and pin had text on them so you just had to match them xB I really think its not about people not understanding But a combination of people being afraid to mess up and being too lazy to figure out how it works We joke which is fine because building a PC is a lot easier than most people think But building a PC is vastly more difficult than stacking LEGO  Moving along In highschool when I did my first build all my friends were very impressed when I told them i built a pc like I was some sort of engineer or something Im still confused about the differences between all the m and nvme stuff When I built my first PC earlier this year my thoughts were Oh shit this stuff is so fragile and My hands are too big how am I supposed to screw this in In my experience its more like packing a suitcase Stuff is sticking out and I have to jam everything in I want to build a gaming PC but Im entirely intimidated by the logistics of it I dont know where to begin haha Shhh dont tell them that how else am I going to brag to my nontech friends In my public speaking class in college I had to give a speech that teaches something I did How to built your own PC When I started everyone was like WTF man too much My opener ended with If you can play with legos you can build a computer This reminded me of that By the end everyone was shocked at how simple it was Ive always described PC building as messing with expensive Legos Theres a lot of mysticism and ignorance around computers in general that sadly hasnt really improved over time I dunno Im always scared of touching something wrong and ruining  of hardware Somehow I still get stressed and have to stop myself from sweating on the components I remember the first PC I built I had a lot of issues with setting up the Bios I couldnt figure out how to get it to recognize my drive so that I could install windows So I asked on Anantech forums and those guys are some uptight pricks My respondents told me that I shouldnt be building PCs if I didnt know how to set it up Other forums were either no answers or some smart ass one so no one online would help me since I didnt understand the Bios options at all back then If I remember right I think I had to take a floppy and put a driver on it so that Windows could read my drive and in Bios I had to setup the option for AHCI or something like thatit wasnt much but back then I had to spend hours reading various stuff I could find on search engines and thankfully I had another computer for which to do that with Had I been building a computer without owning another one I would have been screwed Today however there is a guide for everything and videos for illustration When you are banging your mobo all over the place inside your case youll find that its more stressful You get anxiety from building with lego Back in the s early s you needed skills to build a pc Usually yes but my last itx build was more like a puzzle Had to put my GPU first in the case before the mobo and everything else And had like  mm space to plug it in the pci As long as my mom thinks that Im a genius for building my own PC I dont really mind Noobs I goto the beach collect silicon and forge the parts myselfs Shouldnt they be holding the soldering iron closer to the tip Edit Folks come on httpswwwboredpandacomsolderingironstockimagefailsutmsourcegoogleutmmediumorganicutmcampaignorganic I really want to built my own pc but I dont know where to start so if anyone wants to help me Ill be verry happy Its not like it used to be with dip switches hard IRQDMA port configurations and then setting up your configsys and autoexecbat files to get Kb base RAM so you could play a game The number of boot configuration disks I had was mental If you think current systems are easy there are some old ibm computers designed to be serviced without tools Everything is push pins and such so no tools required to swap out any given part I always use this as an example to people who dont think they can build their own computer Its techie adult legos But when you drop a piece in legos and it breaks it doesnt cost hundreds of dollars I like the lego comparison when its brought up but the difference is that you dont get all the compatible pieces together in one nice box set And while there are immenselyhelpful tools and web sites out there to guide you its still nervewracking pushing that buy button on hundreds of dollars of components trusting that that information is accurate and youre not wasting time or money Once you do have all the right pieces in front of you though then its absolutely lego building for me building pc is more like that peg box with square triangle and round hole and i have bricks in those shapes god bless idiot proof atx connectors thank you for reassuring me as for i am asaving up for my first build  Except the legos bricks are made out of gold and there are thousands of guides on how to make one house And it glows rainbow colors because it does Because its more assembling than building What family thinks of PC building Omg what programming language did you use I legit tell people its as easy as legos Both are true just different time periods Just getting into computers in  was more like the top Now a days its the bottom i use legos as standoffs in my pc Its all fun and games until the electricity bill arrives Despite being factually correct I feel like this is going to get a ton of hate on this sub So true My PC isnt even better than the psp ugh pcs are great but I agree they can be as complicated as those lego sets for ages  Im just relieved theyre actually holding the soldering iron properly The most dangerous part of building a PC is getting the cooling right and what I found really frustrating at first was getting the thermal paste on the CPU in a smooth even spread cause most of the time it just would settle into its own organic shape which I dont believe is very efficient I tell my family and friends this and they think im being modest This is so true My girlfriend still thinks its super impressive that I can build a pc  Im old enough to remember when building or modifying a computer did in fact require occasional soldering Things are much better now Nostalgia is a bizarre cargo cult About the only thing I sometimes miss from old timey PC building is manually setting IRQs and DMA channels Plug and play still annoys me from time to time Ive never actually built a PC and always assumed that you needed to know like everything about the parts to build one Would you guys say that I could built one with a basic knowledge of the components and by just watching some tutorials on YT or something Is PC building really this easy I see videos of folks getting a case many parts and putting all that together within the case and making the necessary connections it looked so difficult just like a little Lego Imo its a bit more like httpsiimgurcomEJpMnjpg Looks like that girl is about to say pizza time The most anxietyinducing part of building a PC is when you try to turn it on the first timeand then possibly have to spend hours finding out which component is defective and doing RMAs and now your next couple of weekends are ruined When I was younger I looked at people who pay for overpriced fully built rigs as suckersits true when you are older your perspectives change Why arent those kids wearing an antistatic bracelet facts Except if you touch the wrong Lego on a really dry day it stops connecting to the other pieces ever again Thats way too many pieces should be like  The most difficult part is cable management I just tell people that its just very very expensive LEGOs that can only go one place for me its reverse httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentsbsurimamasterbuilder Except if you step on a part it hurts in your wallet I wish I could have afforded to use PC parts instead of Legos when I was a kid If you need to solder during a PC build youre doing it wrong soldering is also easy  Legit I never believed how actually easy it is until I built my rig Just whack the stuff in a case and call it a day Exactly like that up to the point where you fear of it breaking That first image is what it feels like to upgrade a laptop god damm dell you really dont want me to add a bigger ssd Could say the same for soldering It is more like assembling a PC than it is like building a PC I tell people building a pc is expensive Legos This is the most true meme I have ever seen on this sub Systemcomics be damned Dunno man Im always careful when soldering my CPU to the motherboard Yea before I ordered my prebuilt pc I told my mum I think it involves soldering shit to the motherboard I dunno tho and mum was like  and you dont know how to work it I was fucking stupid not a year later Ryzen launchedand my FX  was shown up hard This is what Ive been telling people who look at me like some sort of MIT mensa type person when I tell them about my last build I dont remember sacrificing blood to lego gods while building it but ok Ill be the first to admit that I cant hear that top picture Epic rlegomasterrace Who TF uses a soldering iron while building a desktop PC Picture we have on the outer door of our IT office httpsichzbgrcomfullhBBC I cried trying to push the io shield in More like PC building before the s and PC building after the s PC building is almost like someone designed the parts to fit together True though the only true difficulty of PC building is the dilemma of choosing pc parts People think PC building requires solder Sometimes you want to mod it the other way Soldering is as hard as building legos My PC isnt even better than the psp When you have the build and compatibility checking done for you and you already know how to build a computer yeah its like legos deleted Its simpler than legos There are fewer options for placement and its pretty much impossible to put something where it doesnt belong Now Troubleshooting Hardware driver and OS issues thats a different story At the end of the day it is true I mean for me it was literally just Hmm on the mother board theres a RAM Slot I wonder what goes in there Or GPU slotCPU socket so on and so forth The hardest for me was the wiring it wasnt even technically difficult It was mechanically just hard for me to put everything in Everybody gangsta til the PC wont POST This was true when I built my first rig in  I managed to do it with no YouTube and I had no clue wtf I was doing This is literally how I describe it when people ask me if its hard Way back when I was building PCs from  it was a lot of the former  but you could already see it evolving to the later  today it is  Megablox No its lego duplo You know that giant lego thingy for babies i cant even solder yet i bult my pc Try installing a CM Hyper  Youll go back to the real Legos Thank God My friend and experienced builder and the guy who gave me a CPU and GPU came over to help me build J cringed when I saw the motherboard flexing because he was screwing in the cooler Since I have reseated everything but the CPU and Motherboard Lego is harder PCs just fall together Well fuck me It took me an hour to replace an CPU cooler because the manual was shit and only after watching a youtube video I managed to place the CPU cooler Because of violent pushing trying to install the CPU cooler I killed my motherboard In the end I had a dysfunctional PC and bloody hands because I cut them on my cooler My brother tried to fix it but managed to bend the CPU by placing it wrong into the socket Guess its in the family to fuck up PC parts Ive never had to RMA a lego just sayin I wish this comparison went away PC building is like lego if each lego cost  or more and if you do something wrong you have a  paperweigth Legos for nerds Its the same for building an AR Youre just slapping prefab components together Are we all just gonna ignore it took like what felt like  hours to install windows Id even say Playmobil tho Hardest part in my upgrade was the fact it was low tower so I there wasnt much space but despite that it was basically lego uItsANIsoSMD I dont have the patience to deal with drivers To be honest cable management feels a lot like cleaning my room Best advice you can give is match the shapes Everything has its place Rarely do you ever need to force something I remember putting the cooling fan on the CPU and screwing tightly at one end which caused it to lean and stop me from screwing the other ends I then tried to carefully take off the cooler to adjust it only to realise I ripped the CPU off the board This gave me hella anxiety I remember putting the cooling fan on the CPU and screwing tightly at one end which caused it to lean and stop me from screwing the other ends I then tried to carefully take off the cooler to adjust it only to realise I ripped the CPU off the board This gave me hella anxiety Me explaining my parents how i built my pc Yeah the word building is nonsense in this context unless you actually weld up your own case or whatever Its PC assembling Replace PC Building with soldering and youve gone another layer deeper Im thinking about building a pc by myself for the first time and its slightly intimidating but looking inside mine it seems like everything very obviously has its place if you look good enough The Legos are made of gold though If I had to solder stuff to build my own Id be a perma buyabuild gamer Not a fan of soldering My my days I dont know enough about computers to build one even though I saved her  by fixing a problem myself Every time Ive had a conversation with an older person about building a computer they think Im some kind of genius engineer and I always use the analogy Yknow those toys with the shapes they have for kids where you yknow put triangle shaped block in triangle shaped hole Thats what building a computer is like I always say Im a hardware guy not a software guy But what I mean is if it aint plug and play I cant help you Plugging in the IO to the MOBO is that one part in the Lego model where you think was there seriously not an easier way to do this Pc building is like playing with Lego but the legobricks are all above  Plus its basically the same every time Its the bottom picture for everything except cables I cant hear it  Thats exactly what I tell people when they ask me how I know how to build a PC Its adult legos People think Im so smart for building a pc but it really is just LEGOs for adults soldering can be easy as well just need some focus to not touch urself with it or other components The connectors are mostly idiotproof However not  safe I connected only the xV ATX because i wasnt sure if i could use the xV The System was running but quite unstable especially with XMP I even did a bios update with that connection quite risky now that i think about it Yeah everyone says its like Lego but it feels more like defusing a bomb touch this the wrong way its fried and plug this in to hard its broken and pull this the wrong way its dead Oh shoot I used that picture for my presentation You guys have to find out which one But then you cant get the CPU to seat properly because the mobo has a build defect then when you get a replacement you cant get it to post then you need a bios update then it boots but not all your RAM is usable with  hardware reserved You tear your hair out googling solutions and waste hours perusing the Linus and Toms Hardware forums buy new different RAM at a cost of an additional k then that doesnt work then take it all apart and reseat the CPU and suddenly everything falls into place Yeah its just like Lego BIOSUEFI configuration I gonna end this mans whole career More like lego with dynamite attached When the fuck do you solder while pc building the only game you cant play on PC is Bloodborne  Truth Thats exactly how I describe it too techies Perception vs reality I was so nervous when I built my first PC after about  mins I was like ohthis is easy af what was I nervous about And just as expensive I have friends that say building a PC looks hard and I always tell them nah its just a really expensive set of Legos Yea until you fuck up mobo or cpu pins Been there sadly Im upset you didnt find a picture of someone holding the soldering iron by the metal scope out a new gpu that your decade old motherboard can still support and buy it cause youre too poor to upgrade the whole thing at once find yourself inundated by unforeseen crashes and restarts spend the next  weeks full of anxiety with ever increasing frustrated google searches spiral into further anxiety after thinking that youre PSURAMMOBO is dying and you might have to drop more money turns out you just needed to clean the SATA pins or some other easy bs Except that you are working with several hundred dollar parts which is terrifying for the first time You say its as easy as Legos but also warn of incorrect amount of thermal paste wrong power supply avoid static electricity and more errors which can easily break parts Its not the same thing Its not as easy as Legos Except setting CPU on motherboard Should be called PC Assembling Hahah I always tell people building PCs is easy like playing with Legos I always get these weird looks too Idk why Thats what movies show us Well I am over  and I can tell that I love both and soldering too  Derauer i dont get it The first picture is RPiArduino tho My PC isnt even better than the psp Is it really that easy My PC looks like it was built by people that got kicked in the head by a horse I built my own PC I write scripts that do pretty crazy geospatial analysis but hardware makes my brain shut down Im totally comfortable writing code that the UN use for determining where flood assistance goes in a warzone but building a PC stresses me out I get that its actually easy but its not as easy stress wise for everybody Im more comfortable sorting out where millions of dollars of humanitarian money go but dont trust myself to install a new heat sink Im not saying youre wrong Im just saying that your view is flexible in other peoples reality Edit I even get stressed putting Lego together Abstract thought is more comfortable than instructions for me In fairness if you want to actually build your own mobo its a lot like the first one Totally accurate except for the moment that you turn it on A perfect depiction of how easy it is to put together a computer Building PCs today is like playing with an easy bake oven This is surprisingly accurate considering how much time I spent making sure I found parts that were all the right colours People scoff at me when I tell them building computers is like building Legos People will come and comment on how theyre amazed and how much of an accomplishment it was to buy a ton of electronics connect a few bits together Nupe I Will always believe pc building is like hacking into the pentagon JerryRigEverything would like to know your location Honestly finding the parts at budget price is harder than building the PC once the part are here I work with computers I can build them That doesnt mean Im not going to buy prebuilt because fuck that Its annoying I just built one and had so many problems Cool like cooler and eff like fer What PCB building sounds like I used to electrical and mechanical assembly Mostly computer chassis and PCBs I really miss it because it was

down upgrade that shit Another daily chrome meme eh well I guess its higher effort at least This is great Firefox  not so RAM hungry and IMO just better in general You had me at The program is not responding The FPS of this gif is very cinematic This is very good nice job What browser should I use I generally use chrome now I never undesrtood why one facebook tab should consume  gig of memory space in chrome My company uses webkit from Chrome  in one of our products and we are actively troubleshooting a memory scalability issue with a client html application and this GIF is FAR FAR too accurate Thats awesome needs more upvotes Your private data is the cake just buy more ram lol oh shit I forgot to close chrome now my games gonna be slow Thats some dryasfuck RAM Put some icing on your RAM people I have never experienced an issue with Google Chrome using too much RAM I have never had an issue with Chrome taking up a lot of ram so I never really got this joke Laughs in Opera With the potential chromium updates that will remove the ability to use adblockers I see Firefox in my future This is window edge propaganda This meme is so dated and stupid So serious question Should I be switching to Firefox Is it a toxic relationship to know theres better options out there that wont snatch up like  of my memory but I still choose to love Chrome crome eet ram hahah This shit is cringe as fuck What browser would you recommend I tried to click the prompt Well done I really want to know what RAM cookies taste like now Yall are cutting corners on RAM in your builds if this is a problem for you gb mhz master race checking in Chrome runs fine I love googles email feature where if you use another browser it tells you Try a fast secure browser with updates built in and purposefully makes using gmail slow Tyrone Jamal Oneal Love me some chrome uroscoethorncage you guys need to download more dedotated wam For a second I thought this was about chomebooks I only keep maybe like maximum of  tabs and whe Im done I just close them all or a few Im not using Ill favourite the sites I want kept but other the that having  tabs open is unnecessary in my opinion Been having space issues on an old hard drive for about a year now just barely making do with the disk cleanup tool and removing a few MB at a time Finally found out that all the Google crap in that hard drive was taking up two full GB I uninstalled that shit so fast It can have as much ram as it wants as long as it gives me what I want Memes Pretty much the only reason I have GB in my machine GB for Games andor Apps and another GB for Chrome Of course I guess I could always close an occasional browser window or tab but what if I need to come back to it How many fucking tabs do you people have open that most be an expensive cookie xB Chrome never uses a lot of ram for me so Im surprised seeing people bitch You can set RAM consumption limits in Photoshop you know I should know I just pirated CC  two days ago Oh the days when people complained about firefoxs RAM usage Opera FTW I finally made the move to Firefox last month after using Chrome for  years feel like I left an abusive girlfriend Use opera guys much better browser than anything else My PC is a piece of shit with  GB RAM and chrome has never crashed my PC Am I mistaken Is my PC crashing and Im just not aware of it Damn it I can only upvote once Curse you for being devilishly handsome Google rcomedycemetery This joke is so funny and not tired at all jk Fr real though can someone explain to me how Chrome has been out this long and STILL has memory issues Then you have a game taking one or two bites and moving on to the vramcookies Now only if the plate was crome plated On W Chrome never used more RAM than reasonable having like  tabs of porn open but on W programs started shutting down because i ran out of memory after opening just  porn tabs Pretty sure Chrome crashes with Aw Snap now Im getting like  fps on this video Which if intentional real Keen eye for detail How long did it take fro you guys to make that RGB RAM xB How do I make those cookies Perfection amazing and very realistic thats why i have gb of ram ima choke that sum bitch Truly thought it would be another shitty chrome eats ram meme  That was pretty neat This made me laugh so hard A truer statement has never been made Could not complete the Save Save As command because there is not enough memory RAM My phone froze as the error message shower up My life story right here This is virtual box too It needs Skype hiding below the table quietly reaching up to grab a handful Firefox Nightly all the way Thats why I have  gb of Ram For Chrome Is that why it never crashes when im gaming but always does when i have  tabs open Thats awesome man I dont know why everyone freaks out about chrome memory usage Just download more if you are running low Never have I seen a more accurate representation The BSOD had me laughing so hard Hahaha I loved this sooo much Too real Is the second bloke the lad from that fucking stupid beautifulai advert I would like to point out that at least in my experience other browsers use as much RAM as chrome does But that would be against the circlejerk  Looks at Firefoxs ram usage with just this tab sitting at gigs xB  kay This post is amazing This is so true But why we keep using it Say someone that is currently using it now  Bravo ULTIMATE TEST edgechromefirefox with the same  pages open results may vary only ublock installed on both chrome  firefox httpsiimgurcomxTMghpng Goddamnit Is FF better now I switched several years ago when I found Chrome was way faster Its been maybe  or  years Is the circle now complete I could go for a pop tart right now Better then IE in my experience Why is this so accurate Just download more RAM duh So this is probably a stupid question That error came up for me the other day Im editing a short film in Premiere but also had Chrome open wasnt browsing anything particularly RAM devouring I lost about  hours worth of film edits What caused this and why am I an idiot I laughed out loud at work to this This is your RAM on Opera  Sad true hilarious I have no issues O httpsimgurcomajVdvqLIhttpsimgurcomajVdvqLI httpsimgurcomaSONtUpRhttpsimgurcomaSONtUpR When you have gb of ram and you have  tab of YouTube opening with Chrome using gb of ram Why the fuck you using so much ram  But nothing beats google extensions nor the ui that ive grown accustomed toOH and all my gmails synced together I cant wait to see a GIF of Chrome killing off uBlock and Adblock in wake of the recent news Remember when chrome was the fast and lean alternative to Mozilla Now I am tempted to give Mozilla a try again I often have Photoshop Premiere and a ton of chrome tabs open and my PC seems to cope with it ok I do have GB of ram however Probably should upgrade that  mb then Coincidence that I had Photoshop on and decided to get on reddit through chrome to see whats on the front page Google just announced that theyre going to block adblockers on chrome Ill be switching to edge As soon as it gets its chromium upgrade hopefully without the bullshit Otherwise brave it is and during this time its stealing your information Homeboi must have been hungry Why the fuck does chrome have  processes open when I have  tabs open i dunno must be windows thing chrome doubled my ram usage sure but the total was still only Mb with music playing and other things going on meanwhile firefox pushes it up above G I must be the only one that doesnt have issues with chrome REAL The fps makes me want to vomit A little tip from a tech if you genuinely do get a BSOD with WHEA as its error type then its likely the CPU causing it If you can turn off CStates in the Bios it will usually fix the BSOD If you cant then welp Glad to see theyre still using Windows  Linus taught me how to drop expensive parts on the floor Bless him If he quits Im going to commit cheap power supply I like some of his more simple videos the best like the recent one where is makes his garage door smart its really them just messing around Personally I really like their ridiculous projects like K setup  editors  CPU and some of the water cooling stuff but there arent nearly enough of those These are unique content other channels simply dont have the budget and sponsorship to make and basically tech porn When building my first PC Linus not only made the various componants seem simple but also cool He not only gave advice on what to do but how to do it He helped me get into PC building through his excitement for the entire process Wait so his surname isnt TechTips Recently he posted a video about the taobao  and how to make it work so i tried and ordered it and did all steps and it never worked But the oven gpu technique worked Hes improved my knowledge on so much stuff Also Tunnelbear Coolermaster master case pro  Dollar Shave Club Squarespace Thought this was rlinusfaces for a second LTT was like the third youtube channel I ever subscribed to and probably a big part of the reason Im now an IT major And while Im here let me give a shout out to Luke as well for being the Hobbes to linus Calvin p and sometimes the other way around This part of this post is brought to you by our sponsor I already knew my way around a PC when I started watching his channel but he really made it easy to understand the PC parts industry and why vendors might make the design and marketing decisions they do Its all quite fascinating but Linus makes it more fas fascinatingery Speaking of Linus this comment is sponsored by Corsair He always drops the best videos He is good at making it understandable He needs a teleprompter instead of using that damn PowerPoint remote though Honestly i love his unscripted videos so much more like the recent server room and jacuzzi videos for example I hope he continues to adds in a few unscripted vids here and there Oh no I dropped my upvote on this post Good try Linus He is pretty dang good but man do I miss Luke I saw Linuss drama video just yesterday and I truly felt for him You could tell he was legitimately offended and disappointed in the reaction he got He made an honest video explaining what was actually going on and what actions you can take against it Great guy much love Theres alot of fakers dramatrolls clickbaity bullcrap channels on Youtube and all this time he has remained down to earth consistent informative and professional I only built my first PC after his channel turned my casual PC interest into a genuine hobby Ive watched every single one of his build guides and it gave me confidence and information that I felt other channels just did The mans a role model for everyone into PCs Be inclusive inform others be understanding dont be some jerk that craps on anyone that doesnt know as much as you or prefers consoles What a guy Met the guy in real life back in  at the first LTT meetup Seemed like a real genuine guy super nice He even let me grab a photohttpsimgurcomMwrjRhZ Him and his team make great content and I hope they keep doing so for a long time Im a fan not going to lie Posts like these remind me how young most of you must be Sure but Paul from Newegg helped me the most back in the day Honestly yes i learned to build my first PC from him and absolutely loved doing it and since then have built almost  PCs for my friends and family I love his honesty and commitment to this community I like the mans attitude if its broke try and fix it anyways so far Ive fixed bent pins adapted coolers to new sockets fixed a M slot that was crushed by a video card modded some shitty cases to be better Sponsored by Linus Media Group Im just glad his videos are in k He and his team make a lot of great content and its clear that hes lost none of the passion he started out with Honestly Im really happy for Linus that his channels have become so successful Hes practically the media baron of the Greater Vancouver Area at this point I became fan of linus when he did something crazy like taking his shirt off trying to fix something his last name is Sebastian  Linus Sebastian  not our God and savior Linus Torvalds Ching chong your religion is wrong I love the content but really hate the clickbait titles and stupid thumbnails That man truly is ascended You tubes biggest educator ever I work in IT and the amount of viewing hours of this man i watched is borderline mental Not only does he make great content hes just a good guy Their whole team is just I dunno Real Like other techtubers kind of suck with their scripted stuff It just comes across as dry jokes dont work etc Even if theyre really cool in nonscripted stuff scripted stuff just feels forced Linus never comes off that way I think its because hes just more passionate about really knowing every detail He cares about the things hes saying even if its something mundane that others just automatically drone out on the script The only other person I feel is as natural on camera as Linus is Steve from GN and I think its out of the same passion Not to say other techtubers lack passion It takes a ton of passion to put in the work required to be a full time YouTuber and I appreciate all of it But in every field you have The Best and Linus is just plain one of em Yup Linus is my way I watch his videos mostly from NCIX until i fully understand the proper way of pc building I started watching Linus back when Luke was only known as Slick I believe he was given that nickname back when Luke was hired because he had an amazing mineraloil submerged computer I remember seeing the video of a computer submerged under oil and I was just amazed It got me so much more interested in computers and technology in general Had I not found your channel I may have gone on a completely different path in life who knows From the title I thought for a moment he died dude he taught me how to catch when i drop stuff Built my first PC with the help of Linus Tech Tips just wanted to say thanks Been a huge fan ever since Ive watched literally every WAN Show Helped me build my first pc A voice made for silent film LTT is probably the only tech YouTube channel I trust to not be completely biased even when doing sponsored reviews I bought the OnePlus T after looking over his phone reviews and a few years ago I built my first gaming set up after watching one of his gaming builds which was honestly easy when he explains everything I was brand new to building a gaming rig and built one first try no problem Taught me how to zip tie a cpu into a socket What a hero Making socks and sandals fashionable deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk Hes a real OG in the tech scene What about the other Linus  The one who actually changed the world of computing  Such a cheap way to farm karma They took the concept of budget builds mainstream and made deal hunting cool with the junkyard wars series Linus is one of the best men for tech related content and information   what exactly did this guy do He makes some cool content but had to unsubscribe to him because all of his vidoes have clickbait shit titles these days so I cant pick the ones im interested in to watch The rgb guy Agreed the linux kernel is truly something I love you linus It was thanks to this man I was able to get into the PC scene I disnt have a clue what PC parts were before I ascended I ascended because of Linuss teachings Also hs taught me not to water cool my room and my house I was able to get a job repairing and refurbishing computers largely in part because of knowledge this guy got me started on When I saw that MKBHD had won the streamy award for creator of the decade I specifically remember thinking about how Linus couldve so easily won that too Linus does no marketing of his channel compared to someone like Marques JRE and Hot ones as an example but in  LTT overtook MKBHD in sub count Linus is actually a very good example of how a business should run and expand I would read the heck out of an Autobiography that man writes He understands YouTube better than most anyone and he knows its shortcomings so he made float plane A very smart and still a very underrated channel and guy Ive not built a PC since  currently in the process of gathering parts for my new build stumbled across his videos by accident and binge watched a shitload recently Didnt like the newer videos so much too forcedfake and youtubey this is a common symptom of long running channels though so I cant hate on it too much Older stuff was great to watch His love for what he is doing is genuine and shines through to the viewer More a fan of channels like Gamers Nexus who dont need to resort to clickbaitstyle titles or acting like adultsized children to make videos amusing Just plain tech news and reviews News occasionally comes with a healthy amount of snark Can we take a moment to give upvotes Gold and Silver to the useless OP for posting a picture of a popular person Hey its the guy who makes all those shitty clickbait videos I work  hour night shifts The only thing that keeps me going is my routine of going home Taking my uniform off taking a dump And getting in bed after having a snack and watching the newest video hes uploaded Scrapyard wars for a second or two i thought he died Did you mean All that Linus did before dropping it I built my first pc in th grade because of this amazing man I am now in th grade and am going to be taking the computer science aka programming route next year in high school How would you like to suck his dick Sir The other Linus Torvalds has done way more You mean his click bait videos This was sponsored by tunnelbear He tought me how to avoid his clickbait bullshit I appreciate the work he does he puts a lot of effort into it However I find him extremely annoying he gets so much wrong and most of his audience wouldnt know any better A lot of his guides which could be helpful actually turn out to be very sloppy unprofessional and just a waste of time It makes good entertainment though which is what I think hes better at rather than the actual technical knowledge By giving you upvotes Whats the point of this exactly No This will get buried but Linuss channels are genuinely some of the only ones that made a difference in my life After I finished high school I had absolutely no direction in life I had no idea what career I wanted I had a passion for games but that doesnt really get you anywhere So for the first  months I just worked full time at a fast food restaurant and binged YouTube in my offtime I hated it and I honestly felt miserable I did however eventually discover Linus channels since at the time I was considering jumping from console to PC gamer I binged a bunch of his videos to learn as much as I could about PCs so I knew what I was getting into Needless to say I did make the jump and got myself a PC But thats not all I kept watching and watching I eventually grew a massive interest in how PCs work software is made building PCs etc After many many hours of watching everything LTT I grew enough of an interest and passion for all things tech that I applied for an IT bachelor degree at university I graduate this year Linus if youve somehow found this comment I want you to know that your love for tech rubbed off on me and forever changed the direction of my life I finally have direction and a career in the making Keep doing what youre doing yikes He hasnt done anything for me and Im not sure why the IT community sucks his dick so much Hes kept you from losing your virginity Oh look another suck post Has the last episode of The WAN Show shown up on YouTube yet thanks mrlinus Thank you Linus for dropping expensive prototypes Lingering the development of modern technology Could somebody TLDR whats happening  I couldnt spend time to watch the h WAN show or his  Min closet video How can copyright strike be so bad  RIP What a head go to bed Tend to dip in and out of his stuff Could take or leave his stuff tbh Id make a video expressing my gratitude but I dont want to get copyright striked Nice try Colton thanks to his videos i am now able to drop things i didnt think possible just the other day i dropped a like on one of his videos how times have changed I thought this sub hated linus  please bring back Channel super fun Id like to point out that your flair is inaccurate Linus is a God of the Master Race in the same sense as GabeN Someone tweet this thread at linus Hes taught me about  of what I know about computers Their recent video looking at how they changed over the years made me realize just how long Ive been watching them The style and production quality have changed a lot over the years but they are still probably my favorite channel Graphic cards is the last He taught the asian guy i forgot Yes Yes we can Thanks Linus As a guy who likes computers Linus is aok in my book If anything Ive learned the latest and greatest will forever be beyond my grasp lmao I appreciate that Linus started disclosing when manufacturers sponsor reviews or instruct specific testing It negates the results in my eyes but I respect the transparency yeah but hear me out How much cooler would he be with like  less earrings Told me my  gaming computer wasnt worth

salty European comment Anyway on with the original edit purpose I know what they are now I pieced some together from the logo and also I wanna say its funny that people were calming down about Trump and the Republicans and thats when they publically endorse this BS and fuck up their image again Whoops Im sure they mean well but many of these people dont OWN a computer  Since the comment has visibility To fellow nonAmericans like  of humans disliking the companies is pretty much our part We cant write to your congress as rtechnology shoves in our throats but what you CAN do is show mass disapproval and let your own ISPs and governments know they should be nudging Murica If the US public loses the battle not only will it impact USbased sites and your online friends but it will have a

comcast and spectrum Mfw i realize console peasants are literally living in a post net neutrality world Pay insert price here to play online TO  FPS AND BEYOND This is beautiful even though its sad that we unite in this very shitty way D I dont think that we should fight against Republicans edit republican citizens necessarily The problem is corporate lobbying from ISPs Lets make this a bipartisan issue removed WE ARE WITH YOU PC GAMERS WE BOTH WANT THE SAME OUTCOME SO LET US FIGHT FIGHT FOR OUR RIGHT AGAINST THE CORPS as a dwarf I am offended you would even compare us to console players Im not American Im Canadian but I still got choked up about this From the way I see it you guys and gals are on the front lines If you go down the whole system has a major breach and it wont be long until the rest of the world follows suit By then there wont be a Gandalf the White for any of us Fight the good fight guys Good image but the republican symbol doesnt need to be there Some people like me are republican and support net neutrality Reddit tends to paint a bad image of us but we are not all that bad I think we can all agree no matter what we game or stream on the most important thing is GETTING THE FUCKING QUOTE RIGHT OH MY GOD it should be friend Not all republicans are against net nutrality deleted Bit offtopic but I dont get why people fight over plataforms We all play games Who cares where and how Lets just get along already So we are trash until you need us to fight on the frontlines lol Glorious removed You could always move to Canada

imagined Gimli as the PC gamer and Legolas as the console peasant Huh If you think its only Republicans that are against Net Neutrality I think you have some mixed ideas Both parties have dealings with big companies that want Net Neutrality dead This is a bipartisan thing Dont hate all conservatives just hate the ones who support corporations over small buisness This was actually one of my favorite scenes in the entire trilogy Charter Spectrum and Time Warner Cable are the same thing now They had a merger Good analogy for life You do better when you can work with people Youll have things you dont like and do like with others or otherwise youll have things in common and things that arent alike Love how TWC is there twice Its like frames per second correlates to inches of height Great stuff Noob question  if I dont live in the US how can I help  deleted As a steel worker who is about to take part in contract talks very soon Ill use the same motto here as we are using in our mill Stand as one speak out as one and fight as one This is a breach of our fundamental right to a free and open internet where creativity and humanity flourish We cannot let this happen Letting net neutrality slip through our hands is a literal detriment to society as a whole We in America are the first domino if we fall the rest of the world will fall It is our duty to protect not only our rights to a free and open internet but to also not let the first domino fall so the rest of the world does not suffer the same fate AND MY AXBOX Why is the GOP on there The elephant doesnt belong as were only fighting against the GOP not the entire Republican party The problem when you put the Republican party icon in this meme is that it alienates a lot of people that would have otherwise connected with the message This is one issue the republicans have wrong but to demonize the entire party and all their ideas this way turns a lot of people off Im a republican can I fight against this too Funny you put the GOP icon in there Time Warner  Parent company of CNN Comcast  Parent company of NBCTelemundo Ive had enough of this place constantly shilling politics Im going back to g If yall just voted on election days instead of voting threads on reddit we wouldnt have this mess Stop fucking skipping election days and vote from now on Dont involve party politics as much as possible If you allow them to turn this into a partisan fight weve already lost I would have much prefered this if you didnt stick a political party on there Net Neutrality is supported across the political spectrum If youre going to put blame on one part of the government put the person who instigated this crisis Wondering why console players even care they already pay extra for their online service s Goddamnit I love Gimli My favorite lotr character Doin the lords work here boys Keeper up Wishing all our American gamer brethren a government decision that wont fuck their shit up Where is Gabedalf Check it out now console brother right about now console brother you have to do something americn people dont make them do what arabic ISPs did in some arabic countries trust me it sucks to turn on vpn everytime you want to chat with your friend in overwatch or to use teamspeak cuz its ban for securety reasons even tho a  year old can tell that they just the money In the end were all in it together Ive never knew what Net Neutrality is Cozld someone explain it to me please  Favorite neutrality meme so far Quite a Dank one Its good that you can still fight for this In my country we have a law that guarantees neutrality but ISPs dont follow it and the govt that passed the law and the following one never gave a damn about it even when pressured We fucking lost to console anyway they got HZD I do have to laugh at net neutrality While i am entirely for it i dont like seeing so many people get manipulated by the huge corporations I dont like liars on any level and they are on both sides here The cons we know about they want more money for the ISps The pros want more money for the corporations who advertise and sell on the internet Does anyone not realize that the biggest backer of net neutrality is Amazon and google two companies who say the isps should not be able to choose where you go on the internet and then amazon and google strictly limit search results and links and partnerships and purchasing to who they say you can go to on the internet LOL  seriously this is not a fight about your rights by any means This is a fight about who gets more of your money So choose the side you want but at least do it for the right reasons BTW net neutrality has ZERo to do with how much data you get every month deleted I work for Spectrum Love my job I want a fair and unfucked internet My supervisor wants a fair and unfucked internet Unfortunately we dont really have a say Were not high enough on the pole to make a difference Just going with the flow Coming from someone in a city that has competitors one of which is going fullblown fiber Its a fun fight Net neutrality is a necessity It is our job to spread the message to all who havent realised this yet I promised myself I wouldnt cry You know we are very passionate about this when console and pc gamers come together I can get behind this synergy The enemy of my enemy is my friend dont make the republicans get defensive over this Never thought Id fight side by side with a PC gamer Well some games on xbox support it I think Toy Story  leaked trailer Shit I remember the old Army Men games Remember playing

Ill come to your house and take it if you dont give it to me xB xB All jokes aside looks epic Heard of the The mean greens Oh wow this ad again Ive seen this posted quite a few times on this sub Is this the ad that I keep seeing in Reddit I used to love RATS maps This is the response the developer gave to a negative review Hi We havent yet fully balanced the game nothing is set in stone Unboxed has technically been released for just over  weeks considering our relaunch The old version was very boring and most of our players did not like it Were always listening to community feedback and will make changes in order to create a better experience for everyone who plays Unboxed I understand where youre coming from but writing a negative review this early based on something that will alter in the future seems a tad drastic In the end it doesnt really help anyone out Doesnt bode well Seen this advertisement on Reddit for too long already gives me microvolts vibes gotta convince my friends now so we can play Isnt this a game already Mean Greens How many times are you going to post about this game This is the coolest thing ever Anyone catch the bug when he kills the tank and a separate model explodes off and the original doesnt move Reminds of derats from cs So nostolgic Love it Serious question is it possible to aim down the sights EDIT also why is your suse so much bigger than everyone else Who else aint buying this If you make it so you can build walls and defences with lego I hope you guys dont get sued into the ground by toy companies Small soldiers meets sarges heroes Id play the shit outta this Keep this self promotion shit on gaming come on now Can we stop with the blatant advertisements All this guy does is spam his game on every single subreddit sniff sniff I

when were having a couch party and want some action Hope youll be able to get traction and keep this game alive for years to come and hell maybe even a sequel in he future  This is a fucking ad Yall do realize this right Theres nothing wrong with advertising but this is veiled as just a normal post Why the name hypercharge I would never think that the name hypercharge would be a game about a toy soldier shooter Its my stand bad company How many ads am i going to see for this game for the next few years jesus It looks fantastic Suggestion I wont be able to play this game well enough to have fun because like roughly around  of white males  I have a redgreen colordeficiency Color Blind I could barely distinguish the Army Men among the many other colors I dont know how youd solve that because that is the color of those toys but maybe they have a glow or a marking or something Sadly i just accept there are a lot of games I cannot playor play well Including nearly all those phone games where you match  colors hah The is reminds me of a Unreal Tournament  mods where you would play on maps of rooms in houses but you were absolutely tiny TBH I sailed in open seas  if you know what i mean  but Im really looking forward to buy this game just for the amazing concept I see toy soldier game I give karma Nice dude Good luck xB xB edit Just checked my Steam to add to WishList it

implementation from this short clip  I have NO idea what I would improve  but I really like this Would buy Edit FWIW I realized what my problem is I really wanted to the player as the tan colored plastic army men Maybe even a bad mold for effect I love games where Im OP but the scale and sense of risk feels low Would likely still buy  Seems like the kind of game that would be killer in VR Toy Story Independence Day Seriously Whats the name and when can I buy it Looks like a terrible derivative game Also stop spamming reddit with your stupid ads You make me remember

heads up Always me and my friends to market a game huh Even if it is the case here theres so much fake useuse of this tactic on gaming subs that using that kind of title means nothing so basically CS rats map This is what was taking place in my head when I played with my toys as a kid If its for sale during the steam summer sale I might give it a try I forget the name but this reminds me of the cs

when a post reaches the top  of rall Interesting response from one of my senators Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality I appreciate you taking the time to write It is an honor to serve you in the United States Senate and I hope you will continue to write with your thoughts and ideas on moving our country forward On April   Chairman Ajit Pai announced the Federal Communication Commissions FCC intent to revisit the FCCs  Open Internet Order In  The FCC ruled in a partisan  vote to reclassify broadband services under Title II of the Communications Act of  Title II of the Communications Act of  was originally designed to regulate the legacy telephone network While I support consumers ability to access the Internet I had serious concerns that the FCCs  attempt to prevent Internet companies from blocking or slowing consumers relied on a s portion of law which was never intended to regulate the Internet Using outdated regulation to police Internet companies threatens innovation and investment in the Internet The FCCs latest decision provides a new opportunity to find a way forward on bipartisan legislation that permanently prevents companies from blocking or slowing consumers I believe that consumers should be able to access websites without a company unfairly blocking them or slowing down their Internet speeds which is why I support legislation to ensure this issue is resolved once and for all instead of leaving it up to the whim of the FCC Again thank you for contacting me and do not hesitate to do so again when an issue is important to you Sincerely Cory Gardner United States Senator I hope he means it when he says he wants to take it out of the FCCs hands I just hope it isnt too late Ive written letters called my senator filled out petitions etc The response from my congressmen have been that theyre proudly voting to remove net neutrality because the public is ill informed and that they know whats best for us but hey they appreciated me taking the time to contact them Honestly I dont know what else I can do at this point The system is so horribly broken and corrupt that I dont think anything can be done until these assholes are voted out of office next year and by then the damage will have already been done How will this affect people that are not American In the age of misinformation things can get DRAMATICALLY worse if these rules are lifted and ISPs can run amuck   Madison River communications blocked VOIP services The FCC put a stop to thathttpswwwcnetcomnewstelcoagreestostopblockingvoipcalls

year it never really dies Its just gonna keep coming back until it passes After emailing letters to both VA Senators each responded It looks like theyre on our side Sen Tim KainehttpsimgurcomXPRcd Sen Mark WarnerhttpsimgurcomJzGZXP My response from Senator Marco Rubio florida Dear Mr  Thank you for taking the time to express your thoughts regarding the Federal Communications Commissions FCC internet regulations commonly referred to as net neutrality Understanding your views helps me better represent Florida in the United States Senate and I appreciate the opportunity to respond Since its inception the internet has flourished with minimal government involvement and has revolutionized our ability to communicate and conduct commerce It provides businesses with the ability to compete in the global marketplace and is an engine of economic growth Continued development of the internet and modern telecommunications free of excessive and overly burdensome government regulations is key to American innovation On February   the FCC voted  to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications utility under Title II of the Communications Act The page regulation was called net neutrality referencing the concept of preventing internet service providers ISPs from creating fast lanes and slow lanes for different content This regulation effectively transferred power from ISPs to the federal government and threatened to overregulate the Internet in a way that would make it more expensive for consumers less innovative and less competitive On April   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM to roll back the  regulation Chairman Pai is committed to an open and transparent process As he explained two years ago the FCC hid the Title II Order from the American people until after it had been adopted Only certain special interest groups were given special access able to make major changes to it The FCC had to pass the page Order before the public was allowed to see what was in it The process over the coming months will be open and transparent with a nearly three month open comment period You may agree or disagree with the proposal but youll be able to see exactly what it is On May   the FCC voted to make the NPRM official The comment period ended on August th and the commission is expect to vote and issue a final decision on the rule I believe modernizing the  Communications Act should be a top priority for Congress and would clarify the FCCs role in the modern communications landscape Congress must create level regulatory playing field that protects consumers and encourages innovation It is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United States Senator I will keep your thoughts in mind as I consider these issues and continue working to ensure America remains a safe and prosperous nation Sincerely Marco Rubio United States Senator Not sure what to think of this For those who DONT think this will affect you if you live outside of the US you are gravely mistaken Think of all the sitesservices that you use that are US owned Reddit Facebook Twitch Amazon Steam Netflix etc The list is almost uncountable If you dont think these ISPs arent gonna try to get more money out of these sites for untouched service to them youre gonna have a bad time Stuff like that will trickle down and fall in our lap and well end up paying for the load meaning service prices will go up as will products Its gonna be a massacre We can do nothing but HOPE it doesnt happen at all and everything stays the same but thats unlikely cuz then fighting for net neutrality would be pointless and we wouldnt even be talking about it The shittiest part is knowing that there is literally nothing we can do about it cuz the majority of US residents have absolutely no clue about this and wont until it affects them Most of us on reddit are a very small minority of all the people that use the net So while were well informed most arent and itll continue that way until theyre affected just as its always been Most people dont go to the doctor to fix whats wrong until its already too late Please actually fucking call Look what we did to EA This is real shit Something important to be noted even if the fight for net neutrality fails in the coming weeks the war is not over This is a struggle that will go on forever and to just surrender to apathy if there is failure wont help anyone All it would take for net neutrality to return would be to either have congress get involved unlikely in the shortterm but possible in the longterm if this can be made a large issue among milennials that are becoming a greater portion of the electorate or have a Democrat in Obamas mold return to the White House and place in commissioners who will change the regulations once again some regulations are in many ways like yoyos where whether they are up or down depends on who is in power Those may seem hard to do but consider a group of people was once able to organize and fight to literally ban alcohol from AmericahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiTemperancemovementintheUnitedStates And then later on another group did the oppositehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAssociationAgainsttheProhibitionAmendment Neither of those sides gave in to apathy despite the fact that amending the constitution is a helluva lot harder than changing some regulations Neither should people fighting for net neutrality To learn about Net Neutrality why its important andor want tools to help you fight for Net Neutrality visit

Well if it does pass at least Ill have a reason to go outside more I think were done for If we survive this round it will just come up again and again and again until it happens All we can hope for some day is that brave little company that realizes it can make more money than the other guys by restoring Net Nuetrality And the next month And the next month And then next Feeling so much resistance fatigue  This is a pointless fight We cant raise awareness every God damn year We need to win every time they need to win once Its a rigged game As a Canadian as well as someone with crippling anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone is there anything I can do to help does anybody know which representatives are in support of the FCC removing Net Neutrality laws I recently got an email back from Congresswoman Alma S Adams th District NC showing her support for Net Neutrality She emailed the following Having a fair and open Internet is very important to me I believe that access to news and information should be as open as possible to preserve the basic functions of our democracy I will continue to work with my colleagues in the US House of Representatives on this issue Please rest assured that I will keep your views in mind as Congress continues to debate these privacy issues If you live in North Carolina then I urge you to write to her showing your support Taking away the freedom of the internet is just asking for riots to happen Pretty sure if net neutrality dies in the US it will affect many countries think of all the content that comes out of the US Well probably mostly affect Canada we use a lot of American sites Might be good for Canadas economy if the biggest sites start moving servershosting to Canada in the wake of US killing net neutrality The CRTC here has been pretty good at preserving it but anything can change What I dont understand is how Google and Amazon who are probably richer than any ISP hasnt just shut this down How do they benefit from it Granted they are two of the biggest sites so paying for faster connectivity doesnt bother them with the insane amount cash they have Made the call Dont think it will do much as Im a minor Sorry all my time is dedicated to memeing against EA So what do nonAmericans do yeah good luck stopping them what are you going to do  tweet them to death  they dont care about what we want and since almost nobody cares about net neutrality its going to get killed What can I do from Canada Honest question because Im late to the party and still trying to understand Net Neutrality My understanding is that Net Neutrality laws have only been in place for a few years Before Net Neutrality we had the Internet for well over a decadeand ISPs never charged people extra fees for streaming for using certain websitesapps etc So why do we think that will happen now if we strip it away Where the fuck is Anonymous wwwgofccyourselfcom  a link John Oliver bought that directs you straight to the part of the FCC site where you can leave comments about net neutrality ITT Shills and defeatists This is how badly they dont want Net neutrality Your vote is meaningless The US government was taken by the corporations long ago No matter how to you vote you have no real power You have the illusion They throw you a bone once in a while to keep you in check and believing youre meaningful to the greater picture The true power is in the back rooms and the world is decided by money passing back and forth under the table Welcome to adulthood kids People get more upset about EA and silly loot boxes these days the net is lost This is getting so old Itll die anyway They might not kill it next month Theyll just come up with it again in a couple of months  repeat this until they finally kill it E typo Upvoting does nothing we need to actually act deleted Why isnt there more focus on the bigger problem We shouldnt need NN in the first place Net neutrality did not exist until a couple of years ago Whatever people are afraid of happening it didnt happen in all the years before NN I dont see the logical rationale to think its going to happen all these years after it was predicted and failed to materialize The fight is always going to be worth the effort but Im really tired of this coming up every year I would help you if I was a US citizen You guys are the last chance for everyone on this planet to have an open and free net I hope you make it These congressmen btw dont really care about your calls The reason why is because your a bunch of liberals trying to convince a bunch of conservative congressmen The conservatives dont care about people who already wont vote for them Who fuckin cares let them take it over let the oppression continue until its time to burn it all down and start over You arent going to stop it you fucking retards Let me clue you into how the FCC works The president appoints all of the commissioners but only  of the  seats can be from the same political party The Republicans on the panel already have their minds made up No amount of outrage or letters is going to stop it Because they think you and by extension Tom Wheeler are wrong This isnt a case of trying to convince people who should be doing the right thing to actually do the right thing  of the  members have a plan and theyre going to pass it I hate saying this because it makes me look like a loon I am not a Communist I believe that Communism does not work nor will it ever work and as a system of government it is responsible for more human deaths than any other That being said break big telecoms shit Honest to God I used to be tired I used to feel fatigued by all this This constant fucking siege It feels like the attacks will just keep coming until either we break or until we seize the initiative and attack them back Call it vigilantism call it petty vandalism call it civil disobedience but I can honestly see no other alternative We have tried going through the proper channels They do not work We have seen this first hand So screw this playbook Tear a new page And start by tearing the wheels off vans and trucks owned by companies like Comcast Verizon and ATT If these corrupt ethicallydevoid morallybankrupted maggots want to take us for everything were worth like theyre fucking entitled to it then at least cause some damage theyll have to spend that money to fix By all means continue voting I still have faith in the system But its very clear that we need a few broken windows and spraypainted walls to grease the wheels Improper data discrimination has been very limited in the history of the internet in the US The threat of Title II being restarted is enough to keep ISPs inline The internet will be the same with or without Title II for the most part As an Aussie I called my local member of Parliament and told them or at least their receptionist They seemed confused but I like to think it helped IS IT IN ONE MONTH OR NOVEMBER nd Whats happening on the nd I keep getting mixed information and nobody is correcting me Im Writing a damn script and you guys arent helping me out What can I do to help besides calling my representative and senatorsThey are all on my side regarding this issue how many fuckin times do we have to do this Spoiler NN is dead All hail corporate How can a nonUS citizen like myself help out Whats the point anymore Nobody in govt ever listens no matter how hard we try Disclaimer I dont live in the US but I read Reddit enough to know Heres the thing with net neutrality  quite a lot of people dont really have the time or patience to be put through all of these calls and they probably know that already At this point weve probably already lost We voted in Republicans Theyre not going to give a shit about your calls Serious question Why isnt this being put this a general vote This will effect a majority of people in the United States Shouldnt something this big be up to the people not the representatives This is making me seriously reconsider my stance on the America in an oligarchy debate can you call congress if you live in Australia i want to help Submitted  month ago  Elections have consequences We can thank rTheDonald for this Isnt this what they said the last month and the month before and the year before and the year before Dont get me wrong I support net neutrality But isnt this getting a little redundant Sent letters to David Perdue and Johnny Isakson Am in Georgia Heres the replies Dear Mr  Thank you for contacting me about Title II and internet usage issues I always appreciate the opportunity to hear from my fellow Georgians The Federal Communications Commissions FCC  Open Internet Order marked a dramatic departure from the bipartisan lighttouch proinnovation approach to internet regulation adopted in  Under those commonsense rules internet service provider ISP business practices were policed by the Federal Trade Commission like most other internetbased companies In order to exercise jurisdiction over ISPs the FCC claimed statutory authority under an early twentieth century utilities law designed to regulate telephone monopolies an antiquated law illsuited to deal with such a dynamic sector of our economy Apart from being a partisan circumvention of the legislative process and an executive branch power grab by the previous administration these regulations were largely unnecessary given the strong market forces that have always protected content neutrality and governed privacy practices among ISPs Instead of protecting consumers the FCC Order raised costs stifled innovation and suppressed broadband investment in communities most in need of internet access FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has indicated that the Commission will look at rolling back these regulations this year and interested individuals and groups will be able to comment on any proposed changes as part of that process I encourage you to use that opportunity to share your thoughts as well As Congress considers legislation to remedy the previous administrations misguided regulatory overreach its my opinion that any future policy should ensure that the innovative environment of the Internet is not inhibited by laborious rules and regulations As my colleagues and I work with Chairman Pai to address these issues I will certainly keep your thoughts in mind Kindest regards David Perdue United States Senator Johnny Isakson Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality I appreciate your thoughts on this subject and I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to you I have consistently been opposed to attempts by the Federal Communications Commission FCC to regulate the Internet because I believe that the competition created by the free market will better ensure that the Internet remains open and free I also believe that unnecessary regulations have the potential to stifle innovation and be harmful to consumers On February   former Chairman Tom Wheeler and the FCC released new net neutrality regulations to the public The new regulations adopted by a vote of  reclassify broadband Internet services as telecommunications services subject to Title II of the Communications Act of  This classification gives the FCC regulatory authority over the Internet and access to its content While I believe we must remain vigilant against any anticompetitive actions by service or content providers I do not support this reclassification of the Internet or the expansion of the federal governments control over the Internet On May   the FCC issued a new notice of proposed rulemaking to reconsider the net neutrality rules put in place during the Obama administration I support the FCCs decision to revisit this rule and I will keep a close eye on these issues moving forward I will also keep your thoughts and concerns in mind should any related legislation come before the Senate for consideration Thank you again for contacting me Please visit my webpage at wwwisaksonsenategov for more information on the issues important to you and to sign up for my newsletter Sincerely Johnny Isakson United States Senator When is the next last chance to stop it A month from now you mean unless we delay its death for next month Im in the uk so im not affected but this is so fucked i feel sorry for you guys over in the US Hope the retarded polititions see sence but as usual they probably wont  I added one of the widgets to my site So glad I live in Europe Anyone know if you can call from Europe deleted Can I call the US congress if I live in Australia Anybody have a good template that I can use to write my senator deleted What can I do if I dont live in America Is this an American issue that affects the whole world My Congress people have informed me that they are on our side in this after contacting them What else can I do to help The response I received from Tom Emmer RMN when I wrote him to support Net Neutrality  Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your support for net neutrality As your Representative for the Sixth Congressional District of Minnesota your views are very important to me and I appreciate the opportunity to respond   The internet has thrived as an open and free marketplace without the burden of government bureaucracy Increased regulation and bureaucracy will lead to higher costs and fewer choices Congress should not impose new burdens on innovation but instead allow this competitive sector of our economy to flourish and create new jobs   On February   the Federal Communications Commission FCC approved rules for additional oversight of the internet This rule defines the internet as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of  This classification allows the internet to be regulated as a public utility   As you may know FCC Chairman Ajit Pai released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM on April   which would reclassify internet access as an information service thereby restoring the limited regulatory approach that the internet had been subject to for nearly  years   You may be interested to know that I am a cosponsor of HR  the Email Privacy Act If enacted this bill would update a number of protections for personal electronic communications including a requirement that law enforcement officials obtain a warrant for access to personal email records   Today more than  million Americans use a smartphone and many more use email This technology is so commonplace that many of our young Americans may not even realize that police can read every single of your emails that are more than six months old without a warrant Our Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches must always be protected Today our privacy protections from government intrusion have not kept pace with the way Americans communicate with each other It is long past time that we update our nations electronic communication privacy laws   On February   with my support the House of Representatives passed HR  by a bipartisan voice vote Presently HR  awaits action in the Senate Rest assured should any legislation related to this issue come before me for a vote I will keep your views in mind   Again thank you for contacting me Your input is vital to assist me in carrying out my duties as your Congressman If I may be of further assistance to you on this or any other issue please do not hesitate to contact the staff in my Otsego district office at   or my Washington DC office at   Got this email from Tom Marino and Im not sure what to think about it Thank you for contacting me regarding to protect Net Neutrality I appreciate hearing your views on this important issue As you may know Net Neutrality is a term used to describe the concept of an open internet in which internet providers and governments treat the transmission of all data equally applying the same standards and costs for different users content and modes of communication In a perfect world Net Neutrality guarantees freedom of access on the internet In addition it would protect consumers from being denied access to online services simply because their online providers decide to block or slow down access to certain websites Currently President Trump has begun trying to roll back the Net Neutrality Obamaera regulations The regulations had been in place since  and current Federal Communications Commission FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has been strongly in favor of rolling back the regulations that are in place As a member of the House Judiciary Committee I will have the opportunity to continue examining Net Neutrality and ensure we have a free internet without monopolistic behavior As this issue moves through Congress I will keep your thoughts in mind should any legislation regarding Net Neutrality come to a vote in the full House of Representatives Edit Doesnt seem to be explicitly stating his position Just making it sound like hes against it Im under  now but will be  by mid term elections Will they still listen to me my representative turned his phone off and has a full mailbox  I tried calling Floridas th district but my Congress womans voicemail was full I tired brothers Join the rebellion against the evil empire Ive been calling my rep everyday RLamar smith everyday and also rep Lloydd Doggett everyday Lamar has been dodging my calls and wont talk about Net Neutrality how do I deal with this Also when i try to leave a message hes mailbox is ALWAYS full wtf is wrong with my rep Whats Centurylinks stance on this Laughs in hz Delivery hz but plug in hz tv I mean it could be possible If the the next xboxs gpu is similar to a  that could definetely happen But nonetheless pc gamers have had fps since the crt days and console gamers are only getting support now Doesnt he mean never seen before on console And isnt that true I dont get the joke key phrase there up to  frames not even  Just the ability to sometimes get up there I remember when anything above  fps was useless because our eyes couldnt see above  fps oh and also  fps is more cinematic Them Buying a gaming PC is too expensive Also them Orders  k TV with hdmi  using amazon on their  MacBook Pro so they can play the new Xbox i like how we shit on consoles for them being awful and underpowered but when they actually make genuine strides its insane if theyre actually getting framerates that high on a console its just hur dur dur pc did it first Consoles are affordable prebuilt systems and for the first time in a long time they may rival a PC if their claims are true Because thats genuinely offering performance similar or even above most midrange PCs for a lower cost I think Im missing something here Whats stopping a console right now from outputting fps if a developer actually wanted it other than TVs not widely supporting it I thought the issue wasnt hardware but the fact that you can advertise better if you pumped the graphics up on games at the cost of fps Arent we going to just get more  fps titles but with greater fidelity with the very very occasional fps game I rarely see  Im usually  Yeah but its only  You missed the part where they said k right after lol We are building a mini pc with a cusom OS this is brand new and has never been done before And we have a SSD that is completely new revolutionary technology that you have never seen before Trust us Okay Yeah thought that was funny when I watched e but this is a really good step in the right direction for consoles That is if power is that important to you Ive seen heart monitors with higher frame rates Well they were obviously talking about game consoles so whats the problem k at  fps with real time raytracing like they said seems a tad unrealistic for a console that will cost a maximum of  dollars if you ask me This is not revolutionary for consoles No no no Were looking at the revolution of GAMING Console gamers have been defending fps for so long How will they handle this If they can make this thing under  were PC players are gonna have a problem I mean imo a console is only good when connected to a TV bc you can use it as a media player or when youre a big group of people playing a game together Unless youre willing to spend like k on a monitor that goes up to hz and is the size of a TV that shit is gonna be completely useless What is this plebian frame rate Ignorance and wishful thinking that weve never seen before like never seen before xB Were looking at income up to  million per second  FPS on a hz tv through an HDMI cable Ok At what resolution with what games at what graphics settings RTX Frame sync etc etc I love that there are gamers excited about their platform getting upgrades but the PC  Console gap absolutely still exists and it is as large as ever What about the combination of ssd and solid state drive Or using ssd for vram Like yeah thats how graphics cards work buddy Does anyone believe they are going to get  frames plus ray tracing for less than  Laughs in  monitor stand  the combination of the SSD and the solid state drives Whole lotta Xbox fans here huh Man the ego cock stroking is real here Currently building my first PC and hoping I dont turn into this lol Oof To be fair theyve never seen fps Ok so to be fair if they make a  Xbox that gets the performance of a  PC that is actually quite impressive even if it isnt as high as PC can go Mere mortals But it thought the eyes cant see above fps s Combining SSD and solid state drive technology We know most of our audience will never willingly look outside of our controlled space What happened to cinematic  fps and people complaining that they didnt want  because it looks unnatural Technically most console gamers have never seen Hz before Laughs in hz CRT Unpopular opinion Graphics dont drive console sales anymore good games  innovative features do Xbox is taking a step backwards and leaving Sony and Nintendo to duke it out Uhh I mean laughs in k Hz Oh so NOW it matters huh But I thought the whole cinematic feel was what people wanted Or is this just because the hardware is getting better and you can push it Damn now Im mad again  Man idgaf about consoles or platforms i just wanna play halo lmao deleted Dude my eyes dont even naturally see in HD anymore What the fuck do I need fps for I get the frame rate meme when it comes to PC GPUs but I honestly dont give a shit on gaming consoles As long as I can play games that dont completely look like crap its fine to me  FPS at K is very impressive for a console That easily beats any pc you can build for project Scarletts k price Bruh the guy in the trailer literally said  and then you have the SSD and the Solid State Drive they seriously dont know ANYTHING about hardware Did anyone catch the SSD combined with the solid state drive comment If only consoles would just be flat out Windows PCs and we could all unite under one platform with no exclusives or barriers I am play on all platforms so this isnt biased in anyway I mean they did say k  FPS Not k or less So I dont get why pc gamers are trying to be all elitist here Ive never seen someone play k  FPS on pc If you have fair enough but I havent so before they were playing fps on hz monitors now they will be playing fps on hz monitors PepeLaugh Laughs in  frames at p I mean no not in consoles They are talking about consoles I play mainly on PC too and Switch but come on lets stop these meme they clearly meant never seen before on a console they know what PC is and being them Microsoft employees with huge salaries i bet they have way better gaming PC than most of this sub reddit users Most of their games will still be fps anyways UP TO Laughs in Ryzen  and navi  FPS and actually affordable to the average consumer FTFT To be fair they also said k in a console and even thought that can be done in a PC it normally is a lot more than a price of a console Never seen beforeat a consoles price Foolish mortals Thats  times what they normally get Lmao You know they meant never seen on console right  Now with new premium lowmedium graphics settings and vsync I dont have a screenshot but one of the devs said the combination of the SSD and solid state drive Call me whenever your PC can natively run Pathways Into Darkness Somebody in the xbox sub outright said the scarlet will defiantly be able to do k  fps Are we getting high quality pixels again I dont get why everyone is always so toxic on here fps is nothing to laugh at on consoles Laughs in xp hz g sync Laughs in  with a p hz panel That face in the background is going to give me nightmares In Microsofts defence they were referring to console Laughs in hz Joining in p cries in x  fps Ive tried to ascend but my friends wont follow so Im limited by them Due to this I play on my Xbox  of the time and am looking forward to the future of Crossplay I was cringing during the Scarlett reveal like wooooan SSDand a framerate thats been semistandard for years Everyone freaked out including my friends All in all I think itll be a cool console but it all depends on price Laughs in realization that they were talking about other consoles These things are all VERY important until the console generation is about a year old Then they suddenly become stupid Its a pretty reliable cycle Yall are complaining about not getting  fps but Im out here barely able to pull down  fps while standing still using this nicebutinnowaymeantforgaming Acer laptop GB of RAM no VRAM stock graphics card Intel iU   GHz running games on an external  Dell SNX monitor running at x at  Hz refresh rate And the  GB of RAM is after an upgrade I did from the stock  GB Ive spent  on this setup yet Im just grateful that I can play Skyrim SE and Fallout  on the bare minimum graphics settings I mean Why not For what I expect to be a  console you get what a  PC can do Thats honestly pretty amazing And without the hardware and video card optimization issues that PCs often struggle with Its not a pure first but its a first in its own way Thats something to be appreciated I like the part where they said combining SSD and solid state drive technology Cries in p ultra low fps im kinda looking forward to the next console gen since they are using ryzen chips finally games might use all the cores weve had forever Linus has done k gaming well for console thats insane I hope its true k is probably gonna be trash fps no doubt and who in the world has k when mot very many ppl have k tvs Laughs in  fps in csgo Laughs in master race This is fucking Microsoft right If VSync is off you can still tell the input lag difference from  and fps on hz screens and dude fps with a controller is borderline orgasmic Me sitting here with a Hz monitor cause I cant afford no Hz monitor with p Most console games are still at  unless you specifically choose performance mode over resolution I believe Only familiar with the PS Pro options which let you choose which to prioritize Even then only second hand I dont have a Pro So up to fps will be a massive jump since thats for the base version Itll be about x better for me and thats at K not p They said itll support resolutions higher than K so Im assuming they should manage K fps Though I think Ill be sticking with PlayStation next gen too Only the  was better basically Though Halo and KOTOR were the best exclusives for Xbox vs PS Laughs in PC Theyve never been seen before because the human eye only sees  frames per second Like how the Xbox one x can get up to fps Because my GTA V on the x is scratching the surface of the high s I have the capability to jump off a building but that shit isnt ever happening Getting a computer was the smartest gaming decision I ever made Laughs in k at hz Circle jerk but good on Xbox for pushing higher FPS Given that a super small minority actually play higher than fps Im all for this Never been seen On console fps in minecraft How are they going to argue the eye cant see over  FPS anyway now Well theyre referring to themselves Thats why when you hear apples claim of fastest thing ever they always finish the sentence with on an iPhone So for Microsoft its ironically the fastest theyve ever went on an Xbox Laughs in p hz with GTX  ti Too bad the human eye cant register that many frames Never seen before Also I dont think most TVs support hz most people will use a TV thinking they are getting  FPS laughs in hz LAUGHING MY FPS ASS OFF I dont even have a high end pc and I still laughed I mean Im on a k  hz system but Im also not all that competitive i already had hz since last black friday  but hey  console plebs get it as well  years later  and i dont think it will be p hz  but only p hz  and if anyone tells me its k hz  i dont believe it  just like i didnt believe the scorpio  xbonex does k  xB edit but its typical console peasantry  the way they try to hype up something that has been a thing for ages  like its something revolutionary  lol  i cant wait until peasants learn the truth that higher framerate on budget hardware translates to lower graphic settings i mean they clearly mean in regards to console I will absolutely not allow my Jimmies to be rustled by a peasant box Hugs his rig in a  justified manner Microsoft Well have decent specs and good exclusivesbut years too late laughs in Hz gsync on k super ultra wide If people knew and understood how far behind consoles are no one would buy them Does anyone else do this I use to be hardcore gamer  years ago playing  hours a week Now I barely game that much anymore maybe  hours a week at most For some reason I always have to max out my rig even though I dont game Ill purchase a bunch a games just to test out my build but Illnever go back to play them I feel like Im wasting my money but I cant stop the want to max out everything Anyone else do this Current build i k rtx ti  GB ram two tb Nvme m sticks and k monitor PC Master race The cave men have just figured out fire guys lets be cautious  they might get interchangeable parts next Edit thanks Reddit for understanding this as satire NeVeR bEfOrE sEeN I remember them saying k at FPS Thats not happening on a console anytime soon Laughs in hz You left out the BIG PART where they meant havent seen before on CONSOLES Typical PC player gloating about being a pc gamer My wife just made the comparison that console players are just like iPhone users Always behind and thinking its the new hotness  EDIT She was referring to the fans not the products themselves Since Jobs died innovation went to the grave with him it seems Almost every new thing apple comes out with Android already has Some may be improved upon arguably perfected but the fans treat it like everything theyre doing is cutting edge and its not My biggest fear are gpu artifacts Guess you are a csgo pro now My current computer a laptop not the one Im building in a couple weeks force updated to Windows  April Update It was basically a tablet for a couple minutes just without the touchscreen At least its booted and I dont have to reinstall the whole thing because bootrec fixboot is broken and the grub menu has randomly decided it wants to die My ryzen doesnt even have a built in graphics card so i fear the day that my  stops working with windows You havent known fear until a Linux update was not working you reinstalled some probably important stuff to fix the problem and then get greeted with a black screen when booting Dont worry Windows  upgraded your video driver with  version Yeah I love that after every update I have to find new graphics driver then configure my custom resolution repair the start menu that isnt opening again and also run sfc scannow and also download iso image from Microsoft to repair it with DISM  best OS ever And then your desktop icons fuck up and randomize because why not never happened to me sorry Laughs in I use arch BTW  The second biggest fear is the display manager stopping because of an NVIDIA driver issue luckily AMD makes proper open source drivers which are basically plug and play Every I use Arch btw Having to reconfigure the surround sound on my pc is a common one for me I had a dream that I got ransomware without running anything What Not mine I use linux Bruh I shutdown my pc the other day because the it wouldnt connect to my WiFi and when I tried to turn it on it went into an endless loop of diagnosing itself and I ended up having to factory reset it laughs in linux Linux user here Can confirm will definitely shit in pants if I boot my computer and see windows login screen Funny but this has never happened to me after an update Usually only on a fresh install I panic when I download the graphics driver restart and THEN it does this lol Went back to LTSB Got tired of these updates that just break stuff and add other stuff that I dont need I dont get it rlinuxmasterrace Used to happen in earlier versions of Windows Never faced this in Windows  since it recognises most of the graphic cards Since Ive did a clean install on my PC I never experienced any problems with Windows  or Windows Update At work I also never saw this happen D At first I didnt even know what the problem with this exactly was I just had to manually launch explorer from the task manager because of an update I had no taskbar start menu etc And even my wallpaper didnt load Absolutely shat it for a minute because I thought my laptop was completely fucked Seeing  after every Windows update because the English language pack got deselected again What does this mean Never had it happen to me Now you can be a professional player in CSGO This one was fun The User Profile Service failed the logon Linux gang Laughs in Linux Never experienced this before throughout all the different versions of Windows This is a problem Switched to windows  recently Is it supposed to be this shitty Its significantly slower than my win machine despite better hardware freezes randomly sound cuts out theres almost no user control over the most annoying aspects and theyre reverted anyway during the numerous forced updates the bugs border on impossible to track down or fix and even if none of those were true its still laden with bloatware and ads on an operating system you paid for If theres one thing keeping apple and their terrible practices afloat its that microsoft hasnt put out a good OS in ten years Windows  is a massive turd in a box Microsoft hasnt put out anything this stinky since WindowsME Question my welcome screen flashes for like  minutes before I can log in I have tried google but havent found a fix Does anyone know what this is called so I can google the right thing Huh thats funny My  MacBook Pro never done this So what did it do this time Turned off file sharing again and printer sharing as well Have to turn it back on THIS has got to be the most annoying feature Asking me how Id like to open a JPG file Again Or what program to use to play an MP Again Blurry welcome pics Oh it did the update while asleep and stored in the backpack Got nice and warm Exhausted the battery Im not even going to address color management or the lack thereof Its days like this that make my old XP laptop now a media player look better and better Cant say Ive had this happen in several Windows versions wait Im pretty new in the pc world so can someone please explain this to me I might interpreting it differently Sometimes my PC hangs at bios screen until I soft reset pucker factor of  Not the fucking drivers you muppet Every device runs on smoke When the smoke comes out they no longer work Science Brings me back to the your files are exactly how you left them Someone said its as if windows messed up really bad but frantically fixed it Laughs in Linux After years of Windows getting more and more aggressive about forcing updates I have finally installed a program that will prevent them from updating my computer At theres only a chance that a hacker will inconvenience me whereas Im guaranteed to be inconvenienced if I let Windows update Oh and then you log in and realize that Windows broke your network card driver and now you have no internet and theres nothing to do because your network adapter is no longer supported by the manufacturer and trying old drivers wont work anymore Oh joy Wait do people seriously have these kind of issues with windows updates Sure theyre annoying but I rarely have to fix anything after its finished Ill admit I just bought parts that I was told were good put it together and play games I dont keep us with the tech and hardly even understand much of the terminology but this made me laugh pretty hard As a Windows  user i fear what the future holds Sad if this is a fear of yours Seriously how hard is it to just bring up the menu to reset you resolution properly again A tiny bit annoying Sure Laughs in GnuLinux You are wrong Our systems dont even get to the login screen Get your newfangled  off my lawn Linux automaticly knows the correct resolution and sets that as defaukt and updates dont mess up your configurations Literally just happened to me last week Borked all my AMD drivers and had to clear CMOS and reinstall Windows LMFAO Relatable as F I finally upgraded to windows   after avoiding it for a year It wiped my OS drive Good shit Microsoft  As a software dev Ive had the pleasure of experiencing a windows update breaking my automated system having their hotfix update literally break the OS having to deal with their frankly retarded support staff and nothing being done about it in the end Laughs in Linux Windows xB Well theres your problem My PC had a thermal shutdown last night I sat in the darkness for a moment before retreating to my bed Terrifying stuff i dont own a computer  My screen turned bright pink httpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsIMGjpghttpscdndiscordappcomattachmentsIMGjpg I could always just reset it back to native resolution of my monitor on Nvidia Control Panel anyways I dont see why i will be absolutely get scared when this happens to me Never had that issue with my Linux machines Not saying updates cant Bork a system on Linux just never had it happen myself Laughs in Linux Oh wait we have it worse if you use a rolling release Why does this happen Every windows users fear I still love Win  Me witnessing Windows boot on any PChttpsproxyduckduckgocomiuuhttpsAFFiytimgcomFviFWbwOkGRuuYFmaxresdefaultjpgf rlinuxmasterrace who the fuck updates windows you fucking kike Can someone explain lol My system updated a couple days ago and it entirely broke my audio driver Nothing about the display driver just the audio driver Dont get it  happened to me lots of times usually after failed updates i either just restart and it works or if worse comes to worse i just reinstall graphics drivers Lmao this use to happen to me all the time on window xp Shit would freeze I would force shut down and I would get that low resolution screen  times Can someone please explain I transplanted drives between one computer and another from completely different makes and chipsets and Windows handled  of the drivers perfectly including graphics An update got the rest of them working but not up to date Windows is decent with drivers nowadays I had a windows update kill my computer for  months till a bios update made my computer compatible Now I always think Ill wake up one day with a computer that wont work Mine is where I lose internet connectivity hardwired but its only my PC not the router Sometimes restarting the comp would fix it but day later I would lose internet Everything else seemed to work Then I would need to reformat to fix it Seemed to always occur right around a windows update Changed out my MOBO and other parts so far so good I just had this happen to me last week maybe Ive had bad luck recently with a bunch of shit and this computer is on its last legs so I freaked out that my  had shit the bed Turns out Windows had just corrupted the drivers Mine used to do this every time I booted it up Its like it was trying to install multiple drivers every time I had to wait for it to change resolution and install the nvidia driver A BIOS update finally fixed it My name is Jack too this pic gave me severe PTSD Says a lot when I dont have nearly the same amount of problems with Windows  as people in this thread yet I still fucking hate it NOOOOOOOOO HAHAHAHAH Good one The point between drivers kicking in or not is fearful now Not for me never had this problem except after first instalation Well Windows did just update so something is brokeits mandatory Wait till you get that acrylic blur on the lock screen I have no idea why that feature even exists Whats so bad about windows  Im just wondering Im having firewall issues after the latest big update Reset all my port exceptions and it now blocks every single game until I allow it access I turned those stupid forced driver updates off with Winaero tweaker I think Also turned off the reccomended apps Had that happening with Win after VGA update It was annoying But changing the resolution back fixed it I deleted my Microsoft account to merge it with my other one and now I cant log in That fucking background image is another sign as well Whenever I see that a BSOD is on the way i hate that background so much i cant even explain it Im just concerned about the security vulnerabilities without the update That happened to me once after a power outage fixed itself on its own though The last forced update broke Windows VR now the headset software sets itself to sleep even when not plugged in and the software cant wake it without a full reboot MSs position on this We know we broke it Well fix it when we fix it Fuck forced updates ffs I hate W and wouldnt even be using it if their VR Headset didnt force me to one of these days someone is going to hack microsoft and the update will forcefully brick all our computers Every update And scaling will be set to  for some reason Just leave it alone Always keep copy of the most recent or fairly recent OEM drivers on your drive I often have this happen on some of my computers I also loose sound volume on one after each major update I updated a mouse the other day and had to fresh start my ol girl Why even update windows Disable that shit They can go fuck themselves with their forced updates You can just reinstall your drivers no Laughs in red ring It would depend on hardware configuration When I bough my current hardware I did it with the intention doing a hackintosh build long live RDP VNC sucks Apple computers are know for having very stable and compatible hardware I dont need to install or wait for any drivers on windows first boot Also I use the nontargeted windows update channel and get updates after everyone complained and a bugfix was released What does it mean when that happens She bricked WINDOWS  ULTIMATE This never happened to me but until recently one of the last insider build FINALLY fixed this after  year I still had to reinstall my Radeon drivers because each windows update would uninstal them and install Radeon Settings Light instead which sucks and lack features Bye bye drivers I think Windows   is a mess Windows  in general is a mess How do i fix this Windows  user here Could someone explain the joke to me Does Windows  mess with your display settings after it updates Been in an admin account for past few weeks cause my main account got corrupted after an update seeing that sad cyclops is also a nono BT looks like he may need a driver update This was never an issue didnt know this even happens The real issue is now after some update I have activate windows in the bottom right of my screen Got it to show up on my nd monitor so its not ony main one when I game Win win imo Aww shit here we go again oh my I thought I was the only one with low res photo on my welcome screen Im not alone yay Dude same Aaand there goes my icons After I had to reinstall my entire OS and all my software and games after some bullshit update corrupted my hard drive I had to ensure Id never deal with that again Ive managed to guarantee no windows updates unless I allow it on my pc Ive set auto update to am and then shut it down at night This was working fine till Windows decided to remove the ability to shutdown without pending updates executing So now I have my power button on my tower set to shut down and it skips the update phase During long Windows updates the progress screen would sometimes jump to the second monitor sometimes rotate  etc its really weird Well this is the first time Ive heard of this and I do desktop support and have multiple friends with high end pcs The only issue with an update was when it didnt want to open chm files over a network folder You probably fucked up your OS or have a bad hard drive Yea new update fucked everything up reset all my settings twice And they just had to make the sound control pannel harder to get to now What does this mean Im a noob I dont know Jack I literally hated this problem my pc corrupted every update cuz of my ram i figured it out When i took the ram out it worked completely fine Xd bad memories brought back This background right their is my nightmare as an IT because it means windows  imaged to the fucking admin screen and i need to reimage it and change the ou and recheck diskpart and just fuck me is this annoying sad computer noises So AMD runs over both groups of people As long as that means good prices Im in Multi Thread Drifting Ever since I started building my own computer I have always went with Intel for my choice of CPU Im thoroughly excited to soon be able to upgrade to the Ryzen  series Going to need a new mobo and RAM but Im still running DDR so I may as well upgrade it all in the one go Is that Initial D with trains or something Takumi really drifting with trains now Edit Takumi Intel good AMD also good Customers get good deals  Waitwheres the Deja Vu music Even though ryzen  didnt out right beat intel in performance I think it did in sales regardless So the  series must really be hurting intel Ive had nearly every generation of intel processors from pentium  I just missed core duo rd gen th and th Jumped ship with the x DEJA VU intel lowers prices AMD lowers theirs too upvote please Deja vu Ive just been in this place before Higher on the street And I know its my time to go Is what I think of whenever I see these types of drift memes You shouldnt have posted this OP my doctor told me to watch my salt intake Jokes aside Im very happy with my k but at the rate AMD is going I might switch next time I upgrade Those X ITX boards look yummy When you can hear an image Deja vu Intel bad amd good upvotes please AMD Choo Choo Motherfucker Insert Initial D Deja Vu meme httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvAXsLWhttdSshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvAXsLWhttdSs Jayztwocents just had a good video with gamers nexus on which was the best hardware to get for a few use cases I have to agree that the k is the best gaming cpu still but getting amd for just about any form of content creation is a no brainer Who else heard the initial d song Ditching the fanboy aspect intel still has a very minor but still lead on AMD in terms of single thread performance would someone that just games benefit from it getting a Ryzen  x vs a i k Makes me feel even better that I totally switched to Ryzen from two Intel systems I now realized Ive used AMD for the most time of my PC career with Intel only on my short gaming laptop escapades from  on amd good intel bad Deja Vu KKansei Dorifto How to farm karma  Make proamd thread   Profit Amd enthusiasts are just like teenagers dude lmao they hate everything theyre just haters and they even prove my point by downvoting this comment whats the single core processing on this one Is this an ad Its an old meme But it checks out I actually never found a good deal for amd where i come from Deja vu Ive been in this place before Have they fixed the Wattman issues yet lol Amd kansei dorifto Ah yes the shill dilemma DEJA VU Until Intel next CPUs come out and we repeat this tired process all over again Trains do not have wheel carriages to turn forward and rear are in line with each other Thinking they do or trying to make them be on two tracks is total Lack of Logic LOL apparently what this illustration is trying to represent Ryzen lack of compute logic That called two groups of people one train Ok this is in my top  meme today Can someone refresh my memory was the amd gpu the one that needed the game optimization support to match Nvidia or was it the amd cpu that needed optimization to match intel performance  Can we categorize these AMD wins because Intel bad memes as loweffort or shitposts yet They add literally nothing to the discussion misrepresent both CPUs and only encourage circlejerking and karma whoring This shit is fucking amateur hour Reinforcing the stereotype that rpcmasterracehttpswwwredditcomrpcmasterrace is rhardwarehttpswwwredditcomrhardware kiddy hour Looks like a job for Trolley TomhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyAcWNOWZo I like how the first frame implies that whether or not you make it fast x drastically changes the affordability x Semi offtrack derp One of the things that I both love and hate about mangaanime is that even when they do some like normal shit theres always some sort of associated technique and reaction shot Dudell be cooking soup and hell get to the carrots and someone will start sweating and exclaim Unbelievable Theres no way hes mastered the Swiss julienne technique Then someone else will explain in surprise the Swiss julienne technique was pioneered during  in Bern Switzerland by a chef named Hansel Engelhart who was thought to be insane and is usually regarded as the worst julienne technique However thats only by those who have yet to see it in practice by a true master I saw this technique once It was employed by Ichiro Kurozaki during the Shadow Disaster Wait isnt this guys last name Kurozaki They cant be related even though hes using the same technique at a slightly lower but highly proficient level worthy of praise The son of Ichiro Kurozaki would already have mastered this technique I am building a new system very soon does AMD have something comparable to the i  Im upgrading from i k and using ti Intel sets the price They could price their chips at  and still make a profit they simply chose to artificially segment so that they could sell top chips at  AMD followed suit with their own top chips pricing because people proved themselves willing to pay that much If we all stopped spending more than  per CPU tomorrow prices would drop to  for  core chips If anything this image should be fast cores  more cores for Intel with AMD multitrack drifting If only I didnt use DDR RAM I literally salvaged from failed pcs Im not sure I follow OP Are you saying its an easier choice for Intel to make it fast as opposed to affordable because there are less people tied to the fast track And that AMD is both fast and affordablebut in that case what do the people on the track relate to Wait doesnt this meme mean that AMD is killing speed and affordable pricing Or does it mean killing it in a good way Nani  Competition is good for consumers Even if you prefer intel they will be forced to compete and offer a better product for a better price Everyone wins I am surprised at the absence of deja vu memes in the comments I always said that this was the way to get them all but you just laughed What is that from I cant believe you brought this meme back Look here Trolley Tom This reminded me of the movie The Commuter What kind of manga is this where trains drifting is like some master move Is train racing the plot I have always stuck with intel you just cant beat them for gaming and thats all I do now if I did workplace things I would go ryzen for sure I think its awesome to have different cpus at different price points not everyone should be able to afford the best cpu thats why there are other skews Side note how do you guys think comet lake will go The ryzen s can barley keep up with th gen and its a year old at this point X is really expensive tho Waiting for the Bs Arent all their cpus at the same price points as intel I just built a new PC for video editing and I went with an Intel ikf after doing a lot of homework I left the Mac ecosystem after  years because I cant afford k on a machine just to be able to upgrade to other REALLY EXPENSIVE Mac parts lol So I went with a PC this time I chose Intel because I read that for now its more stable with Avid Media Composer and Premiere and since this is my livelihood I went with more stable But I tell you what the second these two NLEs support AMD processors fully which I believe will be soon Im jumping on a threadripper ok which Manga is this panel from Nice one if we choose fast amd graphic card  they were too costlyIf we take the budget graphic card it wasnt fast Soooo assuming I upgraded from my  to a  series sometime in the future what would be your recommendation for a GPU to replace my old gtx  probably the best funny ive seen on this sub Tokyo Drift ExpresshttpsyoutubeRzTKUQjg Someone please share the unedited meme  This looks like a great premise for a card game I hate ads The new m is super tempting though Hahahaha wtf manga is this DEJA VU Both pantographs shouldnt probably be up at the same time in most cases Excellent picture anyway that small detail just sticks out to me as a train enthusiast  Hey AMD you got any more of dem Ryzen s Thats a lot of dead people Deja vu drop intensifies Trial by trolley IntelBbakana Yo anyone got the sauce of that meme I am confused why is Intel controlling amd cpu Intel days try wont be caught up to amd until  P I see that as a win When do we get a GPU that is both fast and affordable But the FRyzen  still seems to have better cost to performance Template please  what manga is that Really looking forward to Intels Answer Want to Upgrade next year Deja VuhttpsmyoutubecomwatchvSZaNqHtE rbitchimatrain What did they do Not gonna lie had me in the first half Collateral damage Pretty sure AMD makes these memes Not gonna lie I went the affordable route during Prime Day Cant wait to get my new parts What is this template called Densha De D does put a smile on my face You forgot the Secure track accurate Yeah if anything overclock your card a bit I have the evga  fan black edition one and my temps never hit c even in the Florida summer In the process of building my first rig have always had laptops to this point Only thing I still need is a CPU Ill supposedly be able to pick up my new Ryzen  x on Monday If not Im going to be so depressed Its taken me forever to find one I would upgrade if I didnt spend my money on the summer steam sale They did it or theyve done it Yeah Im not the crazy gamer that needs to over clock and push my CPU to the limits So AMD is the best bang for buck Lol fuck I just got a new pc and went with intel Lol what do you mean Just buy an K lol ez Alexa  play Tofu music Takumi knows whats up  KANSEI DORIFTO  Intelsama Salvation Ill still buy Intel Its multitasking fuck me for buying an intel cpu two weeks ago

save anyone It takes them out back and shoots and buries them for you so you can restart It just doesnt like digging its own grave is all taskkill f im Is it possible to learn this power I only use task manager to kill other programs I never understood why they dont give Task Manager realtime priority rather than high This wouldnt happen if they did Taskmgrexe has stopped working has stopped working Ah yes a task managerhttpiimgurcomuddjpg Did you ever hear the tragedy of Windows Task Manager I thought not Its not a story the Macs would tell you Its a PC legend Windows Task Manager was a task management program so powerful and so wise it could use CtrlAltDel to end the life of any frozen program It had such a high function over programs that it could even end essential system functions The Windows Task Manager is a pathway that shows programs that some users consider to be unnatural It became so useful the only thing users were afraid of was not being able to use Windows Task Manager which eventually of course occurred Unfortunately it was not responding then it froze Ironic It could save others from freezing but not itself Open command prompt as admin  type tasklist and look for the task name When you find it  type taskkill im taskname f and voila it force close the process I am not sure if task manager is saving the programs End task sounds leathel Maybe it is saving them from an eternal frozen state Posibility that is worse then death rprequelmemes Get SuperF I mean if were being technical he killed others to save himself Ah yes the tragedy of Darth Taskis the Manager Did you ever hear it Obvious aolution open another instance of task manager kill frozen task manager instance then call the task manager police because you just made task manager commit murder upon its own kind My thoughts when the title is Ahhhh yeshttpsyoutubeSiWRCgaHQ Obligatoryhttpctpcomcomicscomiccbcafpng where is your god now  kill  pid Bonus point for when you hardlock the PC so badly it doesnt respond to the reset button and you have to kill the power to shut it off Finally the correct use of irony on reddit Take my up vote sir you deserve it But the Task Manager is used to KILL other applications This image makes no sense Sometimes I look at people having issues with their machines and I just wonder why  how  Now dont get me wrong me too I get the occasional

the hardware is going bonkershttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyQjNPTIo I really wish Microsoft would fix task manager I dont own Mac but one of the many things I like about them is how the force quit actually

unresponsive with a heavy sigh Then bring out the task manager Nothing but the sound of muffled sobs could be heard as the heavy footsteps of the TM thudded towards them Can I help you today Yes google chrome is well Shall I end it with another sigh for extra dramatic effect Yes A slice and a yelp and thud are heard as TM slices the paralyzed programs head clean off And then when I restart

freezes up its a nightmare to stop Theres times where even command prompt with admin priviliges the game refuses to die When even the task manager doesnt respond its time to upgrade lol The only times I see the problem bad enough to freeze task manager is when the hard disk drive is failing going slow read errors etc or bad memory I suppose Malware is also possible but I have not seen it I suggest making a backup and then checking your HDDSSD with your manufacturer diagnostic tool running a Disk Check then a memory test Dew it This is hilarious  Repost from rmemes I put a mechanical HDD in my old gaming laptop because the SSD finally quit Ive never seen task manager stop responding before that time Needless to say I ponied up for a new SSD after about  hours of attempting to use it I honestly thought I was on rprequelmemes and was about to comment General Reposti Lol Its amusing but not really ironic General Reposti you are an old one Thats when i log out and sign back in Its

Reminds me of a friend who plays a mobile game where he has spent thousands and thousands of dollars Dude will then never buy a game full price  and will always wait for those big  sales lol Wont even buy most DLC for games Weirdest thing Ive ever seen Doesnt even get much ROI in the game he plays Hundreds of dollars later he is still like damn man I need more gems for X  Uber Eats Noice  for a game that will give me hours of entertainment Ehh wtf scam it amazes me how large the player base for free games are even if they suck ill never understand why people will spend  on a pc just to play fortnite not saying all fp games suck Games cost money during the steam sale I just have hundreds of  coupons This is totally me I got a high spec rig for Christmas but due to a miscommunication what I thought was a gift was really just assistance with a purchase If all goes well Ill make the last payment on my half in September Fortunately I got Doom and Prey before I realized I was on the hook for so much but any recent releases never mind VR peripherals will have to wait for next year or perhaps the holidays deleted Me Nearly a grand to go to ltx Also me only  off the game Imma wait Thats an easy decision right there because the  Ti will be awesome no matter what and the game might be shit Downvoting because S sucked That hits close to home I have a FTW Ultra  ti and I now dont like to

Looks at my  s Am good yee Every fucking RTX  Ti in this room I live in Australia and thought Hang on Id buy a  TI unironically but then I realised its presumably in USD To be fair in my case where I only have played like  of my games is pretty difficult to decide if its worth it I didnt come here to be personally attacked Please I cant even afford my power bill let alone get a  game I feel personally attacked Ah but you see I use my video card all the time Whereas I dont think Ive played half of the games in my Steam library I really ought to finish Life is Strange sometime soon I

noticeable difference between  and  as you will see You will find it hard to even go back to scrolling web pages on  after being used to  Ah man sorry to hear that Happens I gave a friend of mine a very welcome surprise when I asked him to check these exact settings because I remembered he had bought a Hz screen in about  for its d vision capabilities The pure joy in his voice when he suddenly doubled his refresh after  years of Hz on the same screen xD Also bookmark this httpswwwtestufocom Hahahaha hahahaha how silly of you OP note to self check monitor settings when home Where can I download a hz monitor Same here Purchased my Hz monitor and I always felt like the refresh rate felt the same as my old Hz monitor Checked my settings on my new monitor and windows  defaulted it to Hz We forget that just because you are a member of the rPCmasterrace that does not mean you are an rITpro I just bought mine and it automatically went to hz what a difference Hahahahaha thats pretty funny bro to make you feel better when I first got my gaming PC in my excitement setting it up I plugged the HDMI into the internal graphics not my GPU and it took far too long to realise what Id done I had my monitor for ish months before I realized this as well You are doing a great service spreading Hz awareness Lolll hey man look at how many ppl you just got to go check their own settings This was great Funny sorry from my side One day all my stuff was looking super choppy and I couldnt figure out why Finally got mad enough to go look at the settings Apparently while I was super stoned the night before I swapped it to hz just to see what it looked like lol When you first saw hz were you blinded by its majesty Paralyzed Dumbstruck TIL When I moved I did something wrong that put my monitor back to  hz Thanks for making me check LOL deleted I dont get itdo you guys buy new hardware and when nothing is different you just shrug it off and dont mind the hundreds of cash you just spent  looks at settings  fuuuuu edit My reaction after changing settingshttpsyoutubepLJRZTxnTQt Well how does it feel now pcpastarace Joke aside i would never have found that good on you for sharing How the fuck does someone buy something expensive feel no improvements from their previous purchase and keep using it as is I seriously dont understand some people When I got my hz monitor I also felt no difference and did not know about this particular setting What did I do I searched around and changed it X As someone who just rebuilt his PC hardware and software and forgot to do this thank you Immagino i porconi che hai tirato quando lhai scoperto ahah How did this happen to you Even if your desktop refresh rate is  Hz when youre playing most fullscreen games it still has the option for  Hz refresh rate and it adjusts everything accordingly Damn two stories to make you feel better When I first got my  Hz monitor I loved it I didnt realize that some of my games I had to manually set to  Hz so yeah I gamed for about  months before I turned all my games to native resolution When I built my i rig I had a buddy do the same a few weeks later and I got mine to  GHz on air not hard to do and he asked if I could come over and help him do the same Except he was having a problem as his CPU was running too hot with his idle CPU temp was about what my CPU was doing at full load at  GHz not good despite having a better cooler He had the same issue when he first built his rig did a RMA for a new CPU and still the same issue I asked him had he properly applied thermal paste and he said of course we confirmed that the fan on the CPU cooler was blowing and it was and then checked everything I could think of I asked if his system had been crashing and he said you know what it does seem to crash after I play Civilization for a bit At this point I wanted to double check he had applied thermal paste so we powered the system down opened him case took the cooler off and sure enough he had perfectly applied the paste on top of the plastic cover for the CPU He literally face palmed so hard it left a mark we did things the right way then ran the benchmarks and everything was great No lasting damage was done but now any time I talk to him about anything technical I always remember what happened I mean he did it twice At least in your case it didnt do any damage Oh my absolute god I have just read your thread and gone hah you idiot But then I got to thinking how my Hz overclock mode seemed to lag me So I put the overclock mode on fired up geforce control panel AND IT RESETS THE FUCKING MONITOR TO Hz So thank you because in real Hz its amazing and I cant believe I was that judgemental AND that stupid Im really comfortable with PC repair building programming etc and Ive just been made to feel like an utter mug so i thought Id share Off to play with my new Hz monitor You were using it at Hz and never felt a difference for  months which is obvious but for all that time you were more than happy you paid over double the price for the monitor only to justify to your self the complete waste of money instead of returning it or something thats actually sad man and pretty much show the length people go to justify bad buys I bought a  Hz monitor and i needed a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter so i could plug my HDMI monitor into the DisplayPort on the video card For the longest time i couldnt figure out why the  Hz option refused to show up in the settings Windows was using it was using Generic PnP Monitor so i assumed i needed proper drivers But ASUS wasnt supplying any Eventually i realized its because the HDMI adapter i bought was HDMI  HDMI  has a certain bandwidth it supports and that bandwidth doesnt include xHz I needed to buy at least HDMI   Resolution  HDMI   HDMI   HDMI        Hz   Hz   Hz      Hz   Hz   Hz        Hz   Hz        Hz   Hz          Hz  Welp makes two of us brb Same thing happened to me except it took me almost  years to realize I had to change it  I am not a smart man Kinda bullshit Windows doesnt change this automatically A good test if you have dual monitors in my case its a hz and a hz is to move a window around in circles  is smooth and  is not Next step youre gonna notice your plugged your monitor on your motherboard i hate it when i forget to change my velocita di aggiornamento deleted For me going from hz to hz was noticeably smoother but not a huge difference The biggest difference is noticed when you try going back to hz after getting used to hz This also reverts if you go from  to  monitors frequently and after windows updates sometimes Ive had my iphone  for  months and one big reason i got it was that it could shoot fps p and fps k but my videos were coming out  fps Not being able to jailbreak i thought i got jipped but then i found a free app that allows me to access the  fps Two weeks ago i open settings go to camera and see the menu for changing your video settings  Dont forget to download a new highspeed HDMI cable My hz monitor was running perfectly fine with my  up until a few weeks ago whenever some setting changed that I didnt do and it went down to hz suddenly im staring at OW and PUBG thinking I know i had  FPS what is wrong with my computer I still wonder if its something a driver update did or somehow something I did This reminds me of the time I thought the graphics were really terrible for Chivalry Medieval Warfare but I just thought it was part of the art style Realized after  months I was running it at  x  resolution Makes me feel like how after  years of having

dark deleted Anyone who would like to help should head over to wwwbattleforthenetcom Everyone voice your opinion against this We cant let this happen no matter what My worse fear is that they all force us to buy LeapFrog esque devices in order to use the internet Sigh I hope this never happens I was scared as hell when Mark Zuckerberg tried to implement his Free Basics nonsense here in India but fortunately we were able to convince TRAI of the importance of Net Neutrality as well as expose the lies propagated by FaceBook in advancing the pros of Free Basics deleted So correct me if Im wrong Couldnt you just get a VPN so the ISP doesnt even see what you are browsing Then you probably even get faster internet on some sites USA  The country of liberty For the big guys with a lot of money People keep saying that we should be scared and panicking about the net neutrality roll backs That doesnt work Fear works when You believe your life or livelihood is at stake not when you might lose some freedom on the internet Most people are going to straight up not care What we need is anger We need people to see whats happening and get angry about it Fuck these guys for trying to control what we do in the internet Fuck these guys for providing an inadequate service and finding ways to lie cheat and steal more money from us Its absolute bullshit and we need America to see that to get a really effective response Edit Im going to add something to this If we lose net neutrality you will likely not see anything change anytime soon the ISPs know how unpopular they are They know what needs to happen for them to profit the most They know how much scrutiny theyre under You may even see your internet bill go down Then slowly ISPs will start incrementally changing things to be more profitable for them You may see torrenting and PP traffic throttled slightly Therell be a couple of scandals where Comcast gives everyone the max speeds they can possibly give for speedtestnet and nothing else Shit like this at first But these corporations are smart They know that as long as they dont start fucking with the internet too much too soon then most people wont notice or care Eventually calls to reinstate Net Neutrality will be met with people saying dude the internet is fine the way it is Then well see how bad it gets Then well start seeing paid prioritization and throttling of websites who dont play ball The point of this edit is to stay angry at Comcast Cox Spectrum or whoever else you have until we are guaranteed free and open access to the entire internet

commotion caused mostly by monopolized Internet sources rather than a bill If one provider blocks me a page I go to another one that doesnt I dont believe that you will do yourself a favour if you block majority of websites while there is a competitor that doesnt do that In my small Polish town I can choose my Internet from around  different providers  small local  from bigger nationwide providers  from phone companies I often see people from USA complaining about two or three big players that hold the whole Internet in their pocket why there are no smaller local providers or any new competition I like Daily Motion better anyway so this doesnt affect me s DRINK VERIFICATION CAN TO CONTINUE deleted What I dont understand about this whole net neutrality thing is if ISPs do this wouldnt this just open the doors to new companies who sell internet access without barriers Competition and all that jazz Ok so question please help When is the date that they plan on voting to keep the laws in place I support net neutrality and all But the fear mongering and exaggeration like these pictures are unreasonable Just because its plausible doesnt mean its realistically going to happen This isnt a Harsh Reality at all This is completely fake Edit FYI I am for Net Neutrality But creating a photoshop and then calling it a harsh reality is completely dishonest The title of this post isnt reality its only a theory Theories are not certainties Well it could be worse At least Daily Motion doesnt compress the shit out of their videos like YouTube does Yet again an oversensationalized unrealistic interpretation Bravo Did we see a lot of that before the net neutrality rules were put in place a couple years ago Im not really strong on either side but I do get tired of people acting like thing that was just put into place has always been there and getting rid of it would force us into a dystopian hellscape Like  is the middle ages or something I thought the harsh reality of no net neutrality is that Youtube doesnt count towards your data but Vube does Data caps already exist though Just saying it isnt just net neutrality that is the problem Its the ISPs gouging people I would go as far to argue that ending net neutrality is a human right violation The harsh reality is that this isnt happening A lot of websites are supporting the net neutrality stuff today but I think it is strange to not see anything about it on youtube today Hmmmmmmmmmm Are there actually any consumers who are not for net neutrality Or is it clearly just a corporate gain This is ALL speculation of what COULD happen But what chaps my ass is you people keep GIVING them ideas on how to fuck us over Ugh THIS CONTENT IS UNAVAILABLE PLEASE UPGRADE YOUR CURRENT INTERNET PLANhttpswwwbattleforthenetcom TO VIEW THIS CONTENT Hyperboleeeeee I used to say Google wouldnt let that happen but they seem to have entered partial fuck it mode on the topic free market Where free has the same meaning as in free to murder somebody deleted Great time to live in Australia Im fine me and my kbs wont exceed any limit anyways hehe Yeah but seriously all this stuff is freakin scary I still dont understand how it got as far as it is now without any sane person being like yo we cant do this for real you know that right Take away net neutrality Its cool Ill just start investing in weapons instead of increasing my knowledge  Google would say fuck that and block the ISP forcing them to leave Google websites and any websites they do business with such as through ads so most of them open so this is an extremely oversensationalized reality Same goes for Amazon and many other major sites The real threat would be them throttling YouTube videos subtly to force people to upgrade speeds use a competitors streaming site or pay for a fast lane to access YouTube videos at full speed Even worse for online gaming Wtf is daily motion s Ill just delete it with inspect element Do we know that this is the reality Or are we assuming deleted The harsh reality of no net neutrality we must oppose companies depravity no morality internet offers straight from pelvic cavity to retain access to virtual reality we stand as pcmr nationality What if the ISPs try to copy the consoles and impliment subscription based multiplayer Am I the only one who thinks this kind of bs is hurting the cause Net neutrality is important but Im hardly convinced itll be anything like as bad as people are suggesting with posts like this Honestly why do posts like these get upvoted It simply is fear mongering And to be quite honest in the absolute worst case scenario it would quite literally be the opposite Its MUCH more likely that if ISPs were to force deals the bigger companies would be able to afford the unlimited use fees to retain popularity and traffic where as the more obscure sites like Viveo and DailyMotion would fall by the way side because they cannot afford to pay for uncapped usage and therefore the consumer would need to pay But again this is simple fear mongering ISPs would be committing suicide if they tried to do this we need to make these but with political news radio  religious broadcast so people realize its not just circle jerk stuff The harsh reality of bullshit propoganda mockups Im just gonna keep posting this until at least one person responds and tells me why its okay to censor content that is created or distributed on the INTERNET with the intent to annoy I guess we should just give away our rights and allow a fundamental change in what is legally allowed on the internet and allowed to be communicated basically at all just over the fear they are gonna charge you more for Netflix Something that never gets talked about in these Net Neutrality astroturf threads look at the upvote to comment ratios is that Title II Net Neutrality applies censorship laws to the internet Notice how the proNet Neutrality posters always talk about the possibility that Comcast or Verizon will censor certain content What they fail to mention is that the Law that the FCC reinterpreted and applied to ISPs in httpsenwikipediaorgwikiNetneutralityintheUnitedStatesTimelineofsignificantevents and called Net Neutrality actually contains obscenity laws and speech codes that explicitly censor obscene or annoying content What the FCC is calling Net Neutrality is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the until now open internet Lets not forget the FCCs horrible track record on our First Amendment rightshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCensorshipintheUnitedStates The censorship portion of the Law is under Section  But dont take my word on it read the Law itselfhttpstransitionfccgovReportsnewpdf gta Whoever  in interstate or foreign communications A by means of a telecommunications device knowingly i makes creates or solicits and ii initiates the transmission of any comment request suggestion proposal image or other communication which is obscene lewd lascivious filthy or indecent with intent to annoy abuse threaten or harass another person  gtC makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device whether or not conversation or communication ensues without disclosing his

be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph  with the intent that it be used for such activity shall be fined under title  United States Code or imprisoned not more than two years or both Lets get something else straight its not just ISPs that have a dog in this fight Google Facebook Twitter and Conde Nast all of whom censor content are proNet Neutrality The idea that Title II will somehow prevent censorship is insane  we already have censorship on the internet and Title II will do absolutely nothing to stop GoogleFacebookTwatterConde Nast from censoring whatever they feel like censoring In fact the Net Neutrality passed down by the FCC does exactly what people say its supposed to prevent  censorship  and its important to cut through the bullshit and expose whats really going on here which is one corporate lobby websites astroturfing public opinion to get a different corporate lobby ISPs to do them a favor by not throttling their traffic The FCC was already enforcing a version of Net Neutrality before Title IIhttpswwwefforgdeeplinksfccrulesagainstcomcastbittorrentblocking Source Document HerehttpsappsfccgovedocspublicattachmatchFCCApdf a memo from all the way back in  Remind me why we need Title II with its censorship laws to protect us from censorship again Give me a fucking break This is bait and switch  get a censorship Law applied to the internet and call it Net Neutrality fearmongerastroturf until the public willingly accepts it OH NO COMCAST IS COMING FOR MY NETFLIX They could pass literally anything and call it Net Neutrality and reddit would eat it up like the idiots they are because some anonymous post with  upvotes told them it was a good idea This is basically worse case scenario and most likely wouldnt happen If it did other ISPs would jump on the opportunity and not do this bullshit Competition would breed this out of existence Just like what we see happening with unlimited data plans getting cheaper and cheaper with cell providers My two cents at least Jesus fuck calm down this is not how it works Do any of yall ever actually research this stuff or do you just drink the koolaid like the rest of Reddit But we existed for years without and never had this This is a nonsense strawman Its strawman arguments like this why people dont support net neutrality Hold on whats happening Data caps being put inplace with out customer consent is a break of contract on the isp my cell phone plan is gb of data can no capoed texting and calling thats what I agreed to pay for but if my isp were to put a data cap on my plan they broke my contract with them They would need to renogiate the contract to have data caps only deleted corporate ransomware well shit This is how they should actually be protesting By shutting down the services the way they would be without net neutrality httpwwwbreitbartcombiggovernmentreasonsnetneutrality Say what you want about DailyMotion but they have a much better Mature section than YouTube

gonna use that for Playing Old School Runescape duh Honestly I sort of feel the same I put k into my PC recently Was super excited about it Then I realize  I only play MMOs and I remotely did not need

how old this scene gets we all can relate PCMR GB is not much ram at all  years ago I built my pc to be a longterm solution and it started with  cores and GB of ram It cost less than a high end intel system at the time and even today I can upgrade it to  cores and GB of ramhttpwwwsupermicrocomAplusmotherboardOpteronSRxHDGiFcfm Now thishttpiimgurcomvXttjjpg is what Im really proud of The best rig

your article and just close the tab Is there anybody who visits a website for the first time and subscribes to their newsletter before looking at their content Its almost like these site actively want me to avoid them Also Hey it looks like youre in Canada Click here to go to our Canadian version of the site But you cant view this article on that site Well just take you to our landing page I have a pupip blocker that blocks most ad blocker popups In Europe we now have the General Data Protection Regulation when this was meant to protect you privacy what is a good thing it is so basic and such a bureaucracy monster that everybody fears it So by now every page is asking you tons of stuff extra before you can view it I am waiting for the day I am asked in the McDrive if before ordering I accept the data protection regulation xB The very problem with it in my eyes is by saying yes you give the company a free pass to do what ever they want So tho the law was meant to be a protection for the very basic data it is needed to be asked from the beginning of a process But what comes after the beginning isnt regulated no more So you now can just put this question on every webpage and after the user clicked yes you can do what you want And if he doesnt click yes you refuse to show your page That is not very helpful WHO are the psychopaths who enable push notifications from individual websites WHO Youre forgetting Unfortunately this site is not available to readers in the EU Because they cant be arsed to become GDPR compliant a porn site has less ads Has anyone ever actually clicked yes to allow some spammy news site to send you notifications Why would they even think that anyone would ever want that Are they that stupid cookie popup  nah not that interesting Dont forget the autoplay video they have that you have to stop Very good Now try it on a phone Funny how the media is so concerned that nobody wants to read their shit when nobody can read their shit You all switched to Chrome and caused this Firefox use firefox Someone needs a browser extension that hides those sites so they go away Then in the rare event you ever get through all that  times the article will be full of gibberish and useless info in order to bloat word count and make more money off ads Apple pie recipe  word essay on authors childhood and minor history of apples before you notice theres no actual recipe but a link to one elsewhere And then after all that the article is behind a paywall Last time I counted my local news site uses  different ad services its insane Addons  uBlock origin  I dont care about cookies Then go to settings to disable notification pop up in firefox its called Block new requests asking to allow notifications Voila Protip news sites this is why your clientele is dropping Play stupid games win stupid prizes The fastest way to get me off of your site to never come back again is to show me a turn off your adblock ad I get it but Im only here on your site because a link I clicked sent me to it so I can view a specific thing Im not turning my adblock off for that When the website gives me a pop up to disable adblock no matter if I able to close it or not  I will never visit that website again When the website ask me to disable adblock but in friendlier way and not cluttered by the ads  I will forgive that website This is why as much as I hate Safari its reader mode is amazing for sites like this Havent found a news site it doesnt work on yet Also websites that play videos as soon as they load I say this all the time but WinRar avoids piracy and is widely used by the public because it doesnt do things like this It might ask you to purchase a license but it still lets you use it for free after you click Ok Theyre not stupid they do this on purpose because the alternative of forcing people to buy or support their product will cause their software to end up on piracy sitesnot many people will use it anymore Why websites dont allow you on with ad block is beyond me Theyre throwing away traffic and therefore free advertisementie let me share this with my friends Thats exactly right its not interesting enough for me to turn off ad block etc So why not let those people view the site anyway Ill take my clicks elsewhere Also Answer this survey to continue to the article Allow this site to access your location Donate to help keep the media free and accessible download our dedicated app Someone should write a Disable Adblocker blocker Not only that but websites have become extremely bloated They can easily suffocate lower power  older CPUs So an old but good device becomes close to useless Internet Archive is pretty good around getting these Just want to throw that out there for those who dont want to deal with this BS The cookie thing I understand they used to just drop them on your machine but the EU changed the law so theyre covering their asses Adblocker OK I guess they need to make money too The rest of it Bullshit Who TF actually uses notifications I disabled that shit as soon as I could Kids wont realize the frustration of the single banner ad that drove us nuts back in the geocities days And we wonder why people get their news from facebook and reddit Some newspaper sites actually have video ads that start playing automatically on highest sound so if you use headset hear rape is guaranteed on site load I was dumbstruck when I found out that allow this site to send notifications was built into the browsers and I couldnt find a setting to turn it off Oh interesting click here to begin slideshow Nope We see youre using adblocker to block invasive annoying screen covering ads heres one to tell you to disable it Patreon Make sure to support us on Patreon Sorry IT doesnt allow you to install ad blockers or other browser plugins and you can only use Microsoft Edge Browsing Forbes especially holy hell Lately I have been skipping articles due to this annoying as hell THANK YOU so fking annoying Next theyll ask what colour is your underwear Popup blocker strict Thank me later  Its seriously become a problem Why did Google even add that Notifications feature No one likes it Is there a way to automatically reject all notification requests Unless it can diagnose cancer early there is no conceivable situation in which Id want notifications from some website We dont allow users that are living in GDPR countries The notification thing pisses me off the most Doesnt the website won already since they make money on clicks so doesnt matter whether you gain any information at all Ive settled to learning the important article details in the Reddit comments When places let me read a but and then demand I pay for a subscription I quit I just never go to those site anymore Weve conveniently displayed the content in a  page slideshow with an ad between each one Ive stopped using BBC iPlayer in favour of actual pirate streaming sites simply because they can tell whether you have a vpn So even though Im in the UK with a TV licence and can legally watch their stuff I willingly provide ad revenue for a site using their copyrighted material And Im not going to make an account either Fuck em Behold rpihole  I was just talking about this Click link close newsletter offer unclosable video pops up with no video playing K guess I wont read the article I saw a plumbing truck on the road today that said follow us on Facebook Snapchat Instagram YouTube Ummm Why the fuck would anybody do that Why does every random news site think I want to get notifications This is so true it hurts You forgot the several redirects that cant be escaped by pressing back takes longer than  seconds to load had its chance AMEN This is literally a thread from rprogramminghumor Disabling javascript works for many sites I love that the accept and decline buttons switch If yall use google chrome try httpsadnauseamio it actually works unlike other adblockers I love how you can get rid of the Get Rid of AdBlock pop ups by marking them as an Ad with your AdBlocker and manually removing them This was a pretty bad delivery of the joke to be honest It should end after the fifth slide or something Everyone wants to take our data I think at some point internet will collapse and reborn again thanks to all of this bullshit I mean some fuckers deny me information if I dont watch ads or subscribe Thats just nasty practice I think we silently accept this because of porn Noone comes close to porn for trying to make you click on something you dont want to but we become skilled at getting past that quickly because theres boobies at the end So when regular sites try it its like playing on easy mode Allow calculator to make and manage phone calls the death of RSS and the return of newsletters  one of the biggest low level internet crimes imo Whoever thought website notifications were a good idea belongs under he guillotine Ive never disabled adblocker once for a news site If the news is so interesting I can read it somewhere else TOO REAL  accurate depiction This Bloody sick of it Itll only get worse Theres literally nothing worse than reddit shoving the app into peoples faces Let us not forget the full screen ad pop up  Dont forget GDPR We respect your privacy Please allow us to track you and share your information with our  partners the notification one fking hate that weve updated our privacy policy Websites love doing the whole please support us and dont use ad blocker Ok I get that but maybe you guys should think of not allowing ads that take over your experience and push tons of trackers on you Just because I am visiting your website doesnt mean I should be subject to all of my info being tracked bundled and sold while having ads pushed in my face relentlessly Do they want people to not use their website This is most of rassholedesign posts I automatically send everything I want to read to Pocket Then ignore it for the rest of my life I always get the Disable Your Adblocker message I wouldnt mind it usually but I dont have any Adblocker At all What do you want me to do Article title Millennials are killing journalism Ads literally make me hate products Every successive advertisement I see Im that much less likely to consume your product If you make your shitty ads even more invasive youll catch my personal hatred seriously why does every friggin website want to give my browser notifications Some of them dont even sell things Look up PiHole It basically makes a Rasberry pi into an DNS server that responds to ad requests with a x white jpeg I use it and besides YouTube ads it works wonderfully across all my devices without needing adblock on everything Or you know uLonelyCredit Just use the one click java script toggle and avoid all that work JavaScript Switcher And if the website doesnt work with java turned off then its not worth it The EU cookie law is the dumbest thing ever Is there an ethical ad blocker out there I use Ublock Origin but its too extreme Theres no option to set it off by default and just blacklist the website with invasive ads Honestly I can see why Google wants to ban it even websites that are respectful with their advertising cant earn money However interestingly we men at least persevere when we come across some good porn So true You forgot HOT MOMS LOOKING FOR SINGLE GUYS IN YOUR AREA

everywhere all of the sudden Ide love  but Ive always ran  Usually larger better primary and a secondary Or some version of the sorts They used to be the same model but I needed a monitor for my backup server so my primary is a  inch TV now Monitor is  inch and we got a new TV down stairs so I hooked the old one to my PC Come tax season im going to be picking up a decent p hz monitor for a primary Not sure how running dual monitors with different reselutions is going to work ill probably ask but thats the plan I always actually need at least two Either for flight sim stuff or just having discord on the other A rd one would keep me from task switching on the nd but I dont have the space HyDrOfLaSk Where did that meme originate I just know rep Xbox  cute bottle bro What is your

something mean and then kittys all down about it I respect the xbox  controller love it Ok so now get some studio monitors and figure out how to position them around the monitors at the correct distance and height for stereo separation and frequency balance Im dying laughing over here Holy shit Its been a while since one got me to laugh Perfect setup dont exis I wont make any promises Uh

I loved the performance monitor function on my old Logitech Can a brother get an mx brown keyboard with a full macro pad and lcd display I feel you I have  Stick rocking the OG G How is yours holding up I have  LED out so there is no backlight of the left half of the keys Genuine question has someone who isnt online as much as he used to be Isnt this the wrong use of the meme Isnt the cat supposed to be innocent of the accusation I need I have a similar setup but the middle one is ultrawide XD I started with surround gaming years before it was officially supported by cards At some point it took me quite a few years to upgrade my pc and starting playing more intensive games on a single monitor with facebookreddit and walkthroughsshows on the other monitor Now I can both game in a wide setup and have my windows I just dropped from  to  so my friend who broke his monitor could have one Life isnt so bad But you need tie fighter layout I have  All different sizes and resolutions Its like living with those fun house mirrors sometimes I love it besides the white in the middle monitor dark mode like lole Ik it wallpaper this is cool Where is this meme from Arguing about three screen That Girlfriends not worth the baggage Bro i just got my th nay not seem necessary but shits useful Have been using  for the last  or  years and Ive been needing a third one Can you upload the background I have three monitors at work and would like to use this Dig the retro keyboard I loved that thing What exactly is the point of multiple monitors I know its cool and all but is it actually useful for gaming I know you could have  things open at once using both screen but what about one thing Is it just a really s t r e t c h e d fov for shooters Serious question how do you get two separate desktop backgrounds Ive been trying to set it up on Windows  but I cant seem to get it to work  I like your shelves Link Do you have the pictures men by any chance  once you start a serious monitor collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can Where do you keep your keyboard when you use it Because REASONS KAREN rawfuleverything Alright dumb question But where the heck did this meme come from Its absolutely hilarious every time I see it but is there a source video clip for it somewhere so I can understand better I thought it was really funnyespecially the part about you having a girlfriend I had a similar set up and I made it more comfortable for myself by cutting a board as a triangle and putting brackets and then covering it with a desk mat Way better and more comfortable httpsiimgurcomHomTIZAjpg Well TBH I set up a second monitor a few months back and Im struggling to think what to use it for other than Spotify and moba cheat sheet Edit Moba cheat sheet  what skills I need to use on a new char And doesnt it eat up fps Going through the same battle with my parents rn I can relate to this All  monitors are p the two peripheral monitors being  x  and the center being  x  I accumulated them from thrift stores costing  each Quantity over quality am I right Could you please share these wallpapers with us Thanks I came home with a third monitor when work was tossing

You can use the fuck out if this Microsoft tool httpswwwthevergecommicrosoftwindowspowertoysdownloadfeatures The fact is he doesnt have any girlfriend I have three monitors and honestly kinda want a fourth but theres no room on my desks for one more Because its more than  duh Why does she need  shampoos Im still trying on number  Why Why the fuck not is that an original g man that keyboard was a beast I love multiple monitors never saw the benefit until I started a new job and they gave me  At work its nice because I do not have to keep switching between programs but at home I like it because on one I can have my netflix on the other reddit and maybe have a game up on the third Please tell me you have the wallpaper for us When I first saw this meme I thought it would run out of steam in a couple of weeks Its awesome that creative people have continued to find new ways of using it Spoiler you dont have a GF I also still use the  but I find it uncomfortable now after using a ps controller AutoCAD on the middle monitor assignment details to the right vertical monitor with Spotifypodcasts to the left  man the hz on these monitors is hurtin my eyes My boyfriend has a th one on top of the middle one to watch tv shows on while he does things on the other  I think we have the same mouse Get a new girlfriend a girl I have triple ultrawides side by side She doesnt complain because she plays Sims  on my computer She says she likes the graphics better on low Resolution x It hurts me inside Whats this meme Weird flex but ok Love the background image Give me downvotes reverse psychology Quick flex Im not i will judge you for having the searchbar enabled and edge on the taskbar though Can you maybe post pic I just bought a third monitor and need an appropriate

realize I could have put these exact same shelves up much more elegantly in my room sigh When someone asks me questions like that I just reply Why not Whats up with that cat meme   Shades of white why not Money well spent I know this is a meme post but eh corner tables seem to make the most sense for three screen setups like this For me it depends on the game when its an fps I aim for  fps but in most games Ill push as far as I can as long as I can as long as I can as long as I can as long as I can as long as I wont go below fps Wait until you get  monitors Bad use of meme I hate when people tell me you dont need all this shit when I want it and I have the means to get it Nobody can stop me from getting  monitors and nobody will This is simply incredible I dont like the cables in the back

for his second voyage to North America good memories You can now make the age check remember your age I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who supported me on my first comic I cant believe that my first comic went to the front page of Reddit Well in fairness that age check is only in place because of an idiotic law and since the law allows itself to be loopholed so easily we should be grateful that its not more of a pain in the dick to purchase mature games Ive been  years old for  years now as far as steam is concerned born on New Years Day  I have an account  I have entered my birth date before  I have verified my payment options which includes my date of birth as well  I have made earlier purchases that requires being over age X  I have confirmed my birth date before through a birth date checker  Please enter your birth date MotherfuckhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvVKdsrFtw deleted If there was data on most common birthdays on Steam it would certainly be the first of January on any year I understand WHY Steam has an age check I dont understand why anyone thinks it blocks children from buying anything on Steam anywhere So youre just taking the most common things that show up in this sub and turning them into comics httpsimgurcomvpUFf Yep My birthday is January st insert first randomly selected year at least  years prior to current year The original article is down but httpslinustechtipscommaintopicofsteamuserbasebornstofjanuary Tbh it took me like  years after turning  before I started just giving my real birth date The good news is that now you can just put january st  Any s kids here I have social media now you may follow me if you want more comics  httpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomics httpstwittercomSystemComics httpswwwfacebookcomSystemComics New

coming Honestly this isnt funny and its pretty overused This sub is hyped at the fact we have our owm comic This hasnt been discussed  times and redone in all types of entertainment just like this It lets you through the age gate if youre  years old It does NOT let you through the age gate if youre  day old Magic the gathering arena let me set my birthday to January st   Im only  but I cant be the only one who still feels like a complete badass putting in my real birthday and having access granted to a Steam page  The beginning of time May the Year of Our Lord  bring VICTORY to the Clan MacLeod I love this Great work uSystemComics i like to view pornography also This seems like it would be a good time to post this imagehttpsiimgurcomophZrjpg I absolutely love your comics even the first one had me laughing and this new one is priceless Theres actually a legal backing to that lieing over the internet to gain access to a computer system is a fellony If someone sues them for showing there kid porn they can counter with sending them to prison for wire fraud I was looking it up when I was wondering why I could just mail order liquor without showing and id It shocks me that I can put  as the year now and it works Like damn I feel old And it doesnt notice if you then tell it  when you buy Fallout New Vegas later HAHAHAHAHA Okay Im done lol This made my night Keep it up man Those comics are fun Come on yo these arent even funny These comics just keep getting better and better Im loving them Keep making these comics I love them GOOD JOB MAN Awesome comics keep them coming Do you have a website Man these are awesome  out of curiosity how do you draw these I really like the art style These are fantastic They make me chuckle I love it Keep up the good work man I thought you where a repost at first  Id love to see a data distribution for the birthdates folks put into steam I am willing to bet there are large spikes around XXXX where XXXX is any year more than  years in the past I always do My real day  my real month   Keep them coming OP These are great Do you have an RSS feed Id love to follow these on Feedly Why am I the only one who puts the real date on it  I feel left out You treading thin line here December th  and let us be Jesus I always choose the oldest date first Now where are you from Scunthorpe ACCESS DENIED TROLL xB somewhere they have statistics saved on this and most people are like  years old that play games And then to reset the passwordemail they ask for the random date Annoying as shit I still do this even though Im old enough to put my actual date of birth But they let you save your age and preferences now Ninja edit I use the beta this might be just for those of us with the glitchy clients I seriously dont know how they think that all this birthdate stuff actually works like if you know your too young to buy a certain game why would you be stupid enough to put in your actual birthdate and what would happen anyway someone needs to pretend to be  years old on steam to see what happens I cant remember what site it was but one time I put that for an age check and it said it was invalid lol April th  is my birthday I always say December   a date which will live in infamy My computer does that too when Im on naughty websites Have not entered my actual birthday into any nongovernmental internet website in my life Because obviously Fun fact the last person who was born in the s died in  She was born Nov   The current oldest living person was born Jan   But Social Club is a motherfucker even for multiplayer I thought the System in the first panel was your handle for social media but it seems to be SystemComics System is somebody else entirely on Twitter and Instagram What is the System for in the first panel in this and the comic you posted yesterday January st  I do this every time on steam lol Comparing OPs Reported Birth Date to a List of Known Vampire Birth Dates Yep this checks out Welcome Alucard Please enjoy GTA and this complementary peasant heart Everytime is not a word Come on I would pay to see the distribution of birthdates as recorded from Steams age verification page Ive a similar method Im whatever the default daymonth is and the year is wherever my mouse scroll lands provided its older than  For ones that dont supply the daymonth Im completely random Ah yes the annual birthening January first every year mothers arround the world give life to their children BMOs retirement job after Adventure Time ended justvampirethings Hmm imagine if Netflix did this before every movieepisode i just added  years to my birthday easier to remember too Everytime I tried to go that far it just denied it Maybe it was a better system code At my job we put birthdays of customers into the system and if they dont give the year its always  Not just me seems everyone at work does   Guys its all fun and games until they take it seriously and come up with a more strict age verification If its stupid but it works its not stupid January first  BC i am already of legal age but i still do this cuz aint nobody got time to search through the drop down menusssss What do you mean you dont believe that this drink makes you live forever Look at age of the steam users What a coincidence My Steam birthday is also January  When I needed a fake birthday I always used my own birthday but in whatever year made me  Pornhub be like JUS CLIK THUS HUR BUTTON Im  plenty old enough to buy what I want I still flick the wheel down to some random year just because its faster than actually finding  Im born on January st  Whens yours Whats this OC Quick note for your title everytime is not a word Thats how I lost my old PSN account how many times will this joke be told every time i enter a date i pick new years eve of  Okay by a show of hands who hear is born on January st You cant be that old Youre right Try January st  Thats better have fun Everyday when I buy a game from Steam The gatekeeper has to deem An acceptable date of birth And I say hey I just want Steam to save my birthday for once Reminds me of this httpslinustechtipscommaintopicofsteamuserbasebornstofjanuaryhttpslinustechtipscommaintopicofsteamuserbasebornstofjanuary Im always baffled by the rare website that lets you enter in  but then doesnt accept it saying we dont think thats correct try again A why was an option presented in the first place if its not considered valid to begin with B if you believe I lied on the first attempt why would you believe me on the second attempt Isnt the charade already over at this point  I was born in  Even when you buy a game through the steam app its like you know my fing age WTF Lol you put January   BC Inspect element can make you  yo I see no problem This is how it works for ecigs too Is user   Access  true Please keep with these memes Can I just point out that in  days you have k karma Love the comics dude Let me warn everyone against this At first it seems like a hilarious and easy way to get around the content censors but there are deadly serious repercussions to this After entering this date I got a visit from the Hellsing Organization and had to go through a series of tests to prove I wasnt a vampire or some other immortal creature of the night Sure it was funny but the tests were painful and it wasnt until the very end that they actually treated me decently On a positive note as an apology they comped my game An awful lot of people are born on January st Well Cervantes de Len was born in January st  and stopped aging at  so this could very well be legit Feels better when youre too lazy to put your real birth date anyways I really like your computer character model Keep up the good work I can use my real birthday on steam now I went from a  year old man to a  year old teenager Lifes great how is these shitty comics get so much votes they arent even funny These are excellent Love the new series dude  Back in my day we didnt have this Republican vs Democrat thing We had Luther vs Calvin I just bought PUBG and I realized that the game is fucking garbage I wonder who is the oldest person with a steam account and oldest person with an active steam account I hope some  year old is rocking some games Mine is  my fav squared  number  Back when Civ wasnt just a game these arent that funny I love this comics series so much When I try to view  games in browser the default age is  I have no idea why this would be the case but its convenient Hey werent you  years old last week FFS even my  year old nephew has a facebook account and that stupid site does not check if the people registering are  or older Steam Oh I see you want to purchase Nekopara are you  an Underaged user Yes Here Im born on Jan  something Steam Enjoy your game Fellow  year old here Steam fixed thisI put something in  last time and ever since has kept that date relatable Well if Steam is to be believed either many people are born January st or many people lie on the Internet You wouldnt accuse someone you dont know of lying now would you Yesterday steam asked me some questions like If I accept seeing games with X type of content saying that It would never question my age again This was done through the steam client I didnt test this yet but If its working as intended its finally the death of this old joke Sounds about right Why does the computer wear more clothing than the guy I just started playing Gran Turismo yesterday and it wanted me to confirm that I just turned  I did not but my mother whose birthday that is did This is saying that computers are dumb steam will not save this data Please save it then I dont need to enter it every time Someone really needs to cut together that scene from Hot Fuzz in the pub and the underage younguns who are a few months south of proper  never forget I was the first one to get an SSD in my raid group I said brb rebootingthenIm back was told theyre waiting on me Explained I already did within a few months everyone put their os on one lol Went from a  minute boot to  sec I aint ever going back Kill those start up programs too NVME has entered the chat I have the latest Samsung NVMe drive I wake up and reach over to push the power button get out of bed and sit down and its already at the log in Sub  seconds every time I got my first SSD somewhat early  The effect was somewhat dampened by Asus really long BIOS posting But meh this is totally a first world problem like having a slow garage door to reveal a ferrari The pain of dealing with a spinning hard drive as your primary isnt the reboots its the ambiguous lag that could happen at any time The moment you had anything that was poorly optimized happening at the same time as something else you were suffering I remember back in  I had extension cables for my HDD LED My computer was  feet away from me for noise reasons but I needed to see the HDD LED to not go totally insane wondering if it was lag or if my computer was frozen Monitor wakes up after pc is on desktop Welcome to the world of cant see the load screens cause too fast rssdmasterrace Tfw your load times are too fast and you dont have time to take a sip of your drink As someone who works on an office PC and goes home to an SSD it literally is night  day As a person from the s We used to wait  whole mins for our pc to boot up And if there was an update we would leave the room to watch tv no remote I tell ya You dang kids and your uppity woppity doodads going lightning fast these days Slow down or youll hurt yourselves Ill tell ya the story about how we logged into the world wide web through AOL when youre older sonny Now thats a story And Im over here with  ssds in my computer and I cant figure out how to get one to be my boot drive Word cloud out of all the commentshttpsiimgurcomrQOXZtApng Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit Enjoy Just a reminder fastboot is terrible keeps windows in a suspended state and can have negative affect on performance in some games Turning off my monitor takes more efforttime then just shutting down and booting my pc P Laughs in NVME I went from sec hdd to secssd I see this as an absolute win This is the best budget option for an upgrade I put an evo  or  in my  year old laptop and bootup went from a minute to  seconds on avg havent timed it exact but thats the time it takes to get to the login screen Add another  seconds to actually login and begin doing whatever I want Before I had to wait until every application that boots on startup finished booting up before being able to even open chrome Now I can start doing whatever I want without waiting Best  I ever spent When you get your first STD SSDs can resurrect any pc You dont gotta boot it twice i just booted it and that was that Debian reboots in like  seconds I have a  sec boot time with some Windows tweaks on an ancient Core Duo E with an SSD It kills me using somebody elses computer and having to wait more than that when they almost always have much better hardware I especially hate how slow some peoples laptops are Within just a couple of months I went from booting from an almost decadeold laptop with a  RPM to a new laptop with a SATA SSD to an actual gaming laptop with an NVMe SSD The differences in boot time are just mindboggling And even though Im a patient guy and I dont mind waiting the few moments it takes booting from a SATA SSD I just cant imagine myself ever going back to booting from an HDD Thats until Windows feels like applying some updates I like showing them how game load screens are so fast you cant even read the hints I just ordered my first one cant wait Just wait till you get an M drive Grab your windows key off of regedit make a windows bootable image on a flash drive and install a fresh copy sans any preinstalled OEM bloat I read this as when you get your first STD just built my new pc and after  years using only a HDD this is very accurate right now My little brother went from a rpm toshiba to a evo plus Lmaoo I did the same thing Just to see it boot fast Especially when i upgraded from Dell shitbox to ryzen superawesome space shuttle With ssd M SSD Boots in about sec My first SSD a few years ago I put up a boot video on facebook and this jackass starts arguing that its fake and that the PC was just on sleep I have a evo and my friends hate how fast I can reboot As fast as I boot up with my Nvme I almost never restart or power down unless windows updates Sleep mode master race Install linux and see how quick that loads Youll shit the bed When I got my first build with an ssd those were preety new back then I was in teamspeaker with my bros I would be like brb restarting my pc I would comeback before my previous teamspeak session would drop Once I was playing a a game with a friend and had to reboot my PC he decided that maybe it was time to log off and we can try again tommorow I was confused because I was already rebooting up the game like a minute after I said anything He didnt think it was possible to reboot a PC in less than  minutes Laughs in SSD And then after a while of using it xB xB Ugh It takes  seconds to boot my computer This takes FOREVER I remember first ssd on teamspeak brb need reboot reboot and reconnect on TS with extra  in your name because server didnt kick you yet Hasnt this been posted before I was blown away the first time I got one Zoom zoom I am speed Use a  evo for boot Only reason it takes longer than like  seconds is I have splash screen and startup apps that slow down my login by a little bit I replaced my regular ssd with a m drive a cpl months ago I sat there with a stop watch n rebooted like  times mine takes like  seconds Booting in  seconds is great Went from  secs from bios to login to  secs i could never go back Began with an  pro gb Then I upgraded that to a gb pro and upgraded my  year old laptop with an crucial p tb Best purchases ever Used to have to wait like like  min for a computer to boot up Fast forward several years and  seconds from when I press the power button to when chrome opens up Glad I started learning about computers Why does mine still boot for about  mins from mins Should it be no more than a minute Recently cloned my HDD onto a new SSD to Set the BIOS to boot from the SSD and everything was great Eventually took out the HDD and it wouldnt boot anymore Apparently even though it cloned the boot drive it did not assign a drive letter to it so it used the boot drive of the HDD instead Unless youre on X with GB RAM and most of the time is spent just waiting for it to POST My pc used to boot for  minutes on WD Blue gb HDDnow it only boots like  seconds on ADATA SU  gb SSD True I got a gb Samsung ssd but for some reason I dont see that much of a difference in speed my pc works even tho I did install my OS on the SSD drive I also have a TB hard disk to store my other data and games Whenever i start up my computer i have to boot up windows again Is that normal faster than you reposting I am planning to buy some PC hardware and was wondering should I buy a single large SSD  or a GB m for my OS and a GB SSD for my games I got a new pc with a ssd like  days ago and its much better SSD can be insanely fast My friends who have SSDs tell me that  minutes to reboot is more than it should be I dont believe them He My computer boots up faster than my monitor can now FWP Can confirm My M boots in about  secs This is literally me yesterday So my bro went out to get his replaced Honestly not bragging but I see a bunch of s boots but mine is s How Well booting and loading windows it two different thinks but from button press to windows competed login takes about  seconds for my beast of a desktop that I put together Compared to my mothers shitty Medion laptop that takes  minutes to boot Got an samsung  evo plus D i know that feeling too good Ok so basically  this is my brother I made the switch in  and couldnt have imagined going back Ive just bought an Asus Zephyrus S it has core iH and an RTX with an M SSD it would be quantum leap from my antique  HP DV laptop with  HDD Cant wait for it to arrive Cant relate Just upgraded to an M mad speeds here Wait till you get the PCIExpress version  Yoo i got an ssd yesterday and it feels so relatable I gotta get me one So newbie question windows on SDD gamesfiles on HDD It truly is a game changer So fast It would be difficult to go back to a mechanical boot drive Its still slow as shit if youve got a thirdgen Ryzen HDD Gang where you at Switched from a rpm HDD to a SSD on my rig in  Im going dual ms and a TB hybrid on my next one See me on bapc and sffpc in April  Me with some friends in discord I was updating GPU drivers Alright guys i have to reboot Reboot in less than  seconds Im back Wait you were gone We thought you were still here Agreed Got myself my st ssd on the new pc Never going back You get used to it It becomes slow Being the Flash must be the worst set of powers ever I use TVAndroid as my main monitor It starts slower than my PC I never see POST or Windows loading screen If Im fast I can sign in with a usb fingerprint scanner before I see anything on screen I regret that I didnt buy a big monitor instead It would be a bit more expensive but TV is so sloooow Recently got my first SSD to replace a faulty HDD in my laptop I should have made the switch a long time ago Ive been showing it off every chance I get I now only have a GB SSD in my PC and its amazing This was me going from my RPM in my old rig straight to an NVME M drive Crazy fast Am I the only one who has an HDD that boots up under a minute What the hell are you all doing with your PCs for them to load so slow I never turned my laptop off because of boot times Then when i built my PC went Only SSD NBD turn it off when im done try not shutting your pc down but keep it in S SuspendtoRam standby wont use any more power than shutting your pc down without pulling the power cord and the ram will be held alive by the same V support power that your pc is using so you could turn your pc on by usb mouse  keyboard or network card and then turn your pc on takes only a few seconds and beats booting from SSD by miles damn Cant believe I use to wait sometimes up to  minutes to boot and login and now I can do it in just under  seconds makes it enjoyable every time running a dell vostro ihq gb ram gb ssd and tb Samsung ssd GTX graphics bit of over kill for a laptop In under  s SSD was so fast Windows had completed booting up even before I pushed the power button Oh wait I was so excited at how fast the SSD loaded up Windows I called my wife over to my PC to show her Needless to say she wasnt as impressed as I was Light speed Just got a new laptop equiped with an nvme ssd and i m afraid of blinking during loading screens to not miss game tips When your PC turns on before your monitor does Stupid Question how do I move Windows to my SSD without having to reinstall it Especially NVMe shits real fast I boot in  seconds lol and my phone in  second thanks this thread for helping my ego How do you transfer your OS from a hard drive to ssd When we first mount an SSD we automatically become the SSD biggest marketing mascots I always tell people that if this is just going to be an everyday use computer the one thing that is going to make the biggest difference in your user experience is having an SSD In addition to booting faster all programs and files with also open much faster I just installed one yesterday Using a hybrid drive from Seagate and my desktop boots up in less than a minute I dont really turn it off most of the time though I just put it to hybrid sleep instead as it doesnt make any noticable difference in my electric bill at all I was never able to understand anyone else after that initial boot How could you not buy even  gigs for OS The pure speed of the whole experience was the final frontier in computing accessibility Hurry up and experience the future I noticed it in the first  boots then suddenly i stopped caring about it really I just got a new laptop with an SSD and Im absolutely blown away at how fast boot times are Never going back to HDD for boot drives I already had an ssd as a boot drive but now got myself a TB  evo for my games Relaunching games is so fast now As a computer noob can I move my os to an SSD if Im using a laptop If so how do I do it deleted Is getting a cheap bootdrive worth it I ordered a gb one for my first build It came late but there was a shipping error and they sent me the gb version So happy I was an early adopter for SSDs back when it was ridiculously priced but I did not regret it Made my laptop feel like a beast of a machine even though it was a mid ranged Dell Inspiron I have never installed my OS on a mechanical HDD since I helped my buddy pick out a laptop recently and suggested he get a SSD Him completely unaware of any and all things computers didnt understand why but this last week he has basically been this meme Its funny to watch him get so excited about it starting up so quickly As a side note he upgraded from a laptop running GB of RAM and only  GB of hard drive space of a computer from the Vista era of windows software So just about anything would have been better than that thing Ive been a computer gamer since  and a nice SSD is the one thing Ive put off Whenever I get some extra cash to put in my pc I always prioritize other things One day Ill know what its like Is it really  seconds like some people are saying No SSD in  is just saaad FREE YOUR CHAINS SSD  Windows UNCHAINED Quite new to upper class pc gaming and I just have to ask should I be installing games directly onto my SSD And when I KO longer play then should I remove them from my SSD Does having my SSD filled effect its booting speed If a game is not installed on my SSD does my SSD still assist in boot speed  Thanks I just recently upgraded from a  Evo gb to a  Evo Plus tb and I feel free again My laptop with a   rpm hard drive literally boots up completely in  seconds I just installed my ssd in laptop Can you guys tell me how to move my windows from hdd to ssd Should I reinstall Wont it delete all my files in c drive  Never had an hdd for my boot os Boots nearly instant on an  Went from a  minute boot potato PC to a  second boot monster PC I love ssds Thanks to ssd my computer starts up faster than my monitor Two years ago my son got a new pc with an ssd and had a race with my pc non ssd to get to desktop surprisingly my pc won due to it having that eufi bios thing My non ssd pc hits the desktop in about  seconds I splurged for an SSD a few years back for my thinkpad x Costed me  for a WD gb oof I timed the reboot From the second I hit restart to the second I saw the desktop again With the HDD it was  min  seconds With the SSD it was  sec Ive booted from an ssd for years Just about to upgrade tk a M NVMA its gonna be dooooope Welcome to  years ago kid What is the boot time for corsair mp Local man hangs himself reason being was that he rebooted his PC so many times it died without way to repair Every time my friend asks me to come on discord he always yells omg how are you here already Changing from HDD to SSD is an equivalent of moving out from cheap hobo house to penthouse I have a PCISSD the fastest at the time I avoid booting my windows PC at all costs I will let this thing run as long as possible This is because Ive had all the versions of windows since  and I know what happens Id rather go outside and run around in a circle until I puke than reboot my computer Every computer I have ever built or bought eventually  Will not update  Will not boot  Waits to misbehave and require a reinstall until I really fucking need the computer for something serious I need to get an SSD I currently have an old HDD that is scuffed I did a userbenchmark test and its  of the worst And SSDs are x faster than HDDs so my PC would boot up in about  seconds Nice its so quiet This is very accurate  Same here when I got my adata  gig SSD last may That feeling when Hibernate is no longer Necessary I havent used it since I got my first SSD last year Prior Ive been exclusively mechanical because my budget never allowed for one I know So far behind the times hahaha I remember when I first built my computer had just finished starting it up and was talking to a friend on discord windows was still updating and needed to install the updates so I said hold on gotta install updates Ill be back in a bit rebooted the computer ssd made it boot and install fast as fuck jumped back into discord saying hey Im back my friend just goes WAIT WHAT THE FUCK NO WAY everyone now has ssds The entire Windows operating system boots up faster than Minecraft Yeah I dont know what you are talking about For the past few years Ive been using a old Dell laptop with a  gb hard drive  gb of RAM and an a th gen i This summer I finally built a pc and its unbelievable how much better everything is I hate to be that guy but would you there be a noticable difference if I bought an SSD for my Xbox Maybe again I feel like all the comments are mentioning their bootup time and saying they will never go back Like is there any reason for going back to having your OS on an HDD Is there anyone who tried out SSD and said nope I want my HDD back Im so confused I thought SSD were the norm since like  This was me Until ryzen rd gen  seconds from POST to desktop isnt important when its  seconds from power on to POST You know whats actually FAST Doing that on x M NVMe SSDs in RAID  on a ik with Ultra Fast Boot enabled You guys disgust me Theres sata and pcie m drives Not all m drives are created equally stop using m as a blanket description for your drive Ill see myself out WHAT YEAR IS IT have ppl not been rocking SSDs not for a decade How do I get my speeds under ten seconds Im using a nvme ssd and its still like  seconds Ikr Satisfying isnt it Does a SSD do anything other than increase startup speed Sorry Im a bit new to PC building Im building my first pc an instead of a hdd Im just getting a tb m drive for now to save a little and pickup that speed Rather than a sdd an hdd Except Windows usually decides to do an update when I reboot so instead of taking  seconds it takes  minutes Ha yes Ive had an SSD for like  years now and I still love booting up my PC ha i still remember when i had like  min boot up times when i was  years old ha  evo nvme apex ix gb ram  boot but if i enable xmp or oc my cpu boot time goes up to around  seconds or so still have not found out why Im yet to migrate my OS to my SSD Just cant be bothered Im going from a rpm hdd to am nvme ssd on Thursday I cant wait lol Just made an Ubuntu partition on my SSD To say that it screams along would be an understatement Ubuntu was fast enough on a HDD but its light speed on an SSD Even compared to windows on the same SSD Its just mind blowing Im actually building my first PC and the SSD is next on my list Any recommendations for somewhere around a GB one Reminds me of this old vid when people put  ssd drives in raid Warning can causes computergasms httpsyoutubeeULFfFRi  We could not detect your video card using low presets The game may

games the other day on a modern system when I played it I was using a Core  Duo well actually it was a Pentium but a Merom based one laptop with Intel GMA X graphics and the experience was pretty much identical only difference being p versus x Turns out the stuttering was the game engine itself being unable to cope with more than  ships being modeled rather than my laptop not being powerful enough Meanwhile I like how Portal  can run at K DSR and ish FPS WARNING Full installation of Mechwarrior  requires  megabytes of uncompressed disk space I didnt add the exclamation point When its so old your PC boots Windows XP just to run it Theres a web site out there devoted just to modifying game files for older games to get them to work with modern resolutions I used it for my legit CD copies of Warcraft  and System Shock  prior to the unexpected update of Warcraft  and SSs appearance on GoG Steam I worked the hell out of SS to get it to work on Vista After that no more I found myself spending more time trying to get them to work than actually playing them It was ridiculous Its kind of cute Like the game is trying to tell us woah there buddy I dont know if you can handle this just wanted to let you know to be careful Like a little kid thinking theyre looking out for an adult Oh GTA IV thinks I am out of video memory I guess GB just isnt enough huh Try minecraft on an amplified

CPU is only GHz Are you sure you want to continue When a situation like this happens look for fan mods that allow it to run in  at modern resolutions also try using an hd texture pack I had to buy M Total War on steam because the computer would not use the old school CDs to install the game lol Will it run Crysis tho Oblivion does this to me every time Minecraft would like to have a word with you

a game once that said I didnt meet the min specs of a pentium II and Mb Ram on a core i with Gb HUMONGOUS INSTALLATION   MB My favorite was sim city  They hard coded the GPUs that were available at the time in the config file to set the graphics options If your card wasnt on the list you got stuck with a max resolution of x Trying to remember the fix  I think it just looked at the first number of your GPU so all you had to do was change the config file so that the GPU in the config for max settings matched your GPU On the day of Quakes release a benchmark of the title demo ran on my PC at  FPS At x Do not cite the deep magic to me witch I was there when it was written Ive been looking forward to this lol try Civilization IV Would you like to install game to hard disk Requires  MB of space Yes  MB faster No  MB I tried to play an old game via CDROM I got an error that said Your CDROM is reading the disk faster than it is possible This was back in  and the game was probably from  For me its somewhat the opposite GeForce Experience is like Yeah sure you can run Arma  at Ultra settings and when I join the game Im getting  frames per second I cant even get The Sims  to run on my PC Ive tried every fix recommended to get it running on Windows  but its determined to not boot Looks like its time to downgrade an old prebuilt to  and use it for old titles The best thing is when it actually runs awfully due to poor optimization Was playing GhostBusters The Videogame a few days ago  and in addition to being hardcapped at  fps I run  it actually dropped below  a decent amount p on a TI Playing windowed and a few edits in the autoexec file is usually good to go plenty of mods or patches for the more well known games Support for lesser known PC games is often more problematic Virtual Machines and emulation may be just the only solution playing around with old disks with new disk drives running emulation or using a virtual drive mount etc I take the getting the old games to work part of the fun like playing the games themselves Some janky old games actually run worse than their modern counterparts Witcher  runs significantly worse than Witcher  on my GTX  just because old games arent optimised for modern hardware Then you realize the game was not designed to run with any of the modern optimizations and features and brings your computer to a halt anyways install shaders and k texture see whose the mortal then People all up in here talking about modern games and Im sitting here remembering old DOS  Windows x era PC games that ran at clock speed The last time I booted up Sim Tower and this was a while ago a week IGT was literally a few seconds IRT at the slowest speed You need DOSBOX to run those games now Boot up Wing Commander in dosbox and it asks me to make sure I have a decent sound card  I bought a game from my late teen years that would not run at all on my PC because I was displaying too many colors Dr Healthensteinss Body Fun It was an educational game about teaching Young kids the dangers of bad diets But it was fun as hell and had some creepy af fmv segments with these two jesters who would shit talk you in their mini games I love the old launchers that tell me my computer sucks because it reads the GB Vram as MB because they didnt bother giving the program a way to measure in GB because no conceivable computer would ever have that Unless its Crysis cough Pvz cough crisis would like to know your location I bought need for speed underground  on cd at a thrift store and for it to not be stretched its had to be  be in windowed mode and run at the lowest res ive ever played a game at Until you try to run crysis in k Cowabunga it is I remember in the old days I had an old game I mean old even then that required DX to be installed I had DX or some shit at that point so it wouldnt install since I didnt have DX Brilliant developers for that game no doubt You talking about road rash huh  Minecraft MINECRAFT Sometimes I forget resolutions below p existed for games Minecraft on amplified terrain be like When you set your Minecraft world to amplified The sims has a warning like this How it is going to take up a lot of disc space less than a gig First thing I do woth a new rig is install the highest end game Im currently playing and max settings Then when I want to play I step it down from there Hearing Tomis the train say that genuinely creeps me outand makes me laugh at the same time And you notice that it was actually crysis Can relate after downloading Sims  for the summer sale At least it can do p Lmao amplified minecraft worlds still suck because its more cpu than gpu based Deus Ex Mankind Divided I know its not super old but my PC with a watercooled i gb of DDR and a  can barely run it on high

limits the number of installations any given Crysis license can have essentially forcing you to go through Steams support to have the title permanently removed so you can repurchase the game My Computer Still runs game like shit Get  on pc  hold my beer Or modern processors Stupid Fallout  AUTO DETECTING SPECIFICATIONS SETTINGS SET TO VERY LOW QUALITY Many SAGE engine games CC GeneralsZero Hour and Battle for Middle Earth  kept setting themselves to lowest Bitch please the only slowdown was cumbersome AI This game requires at least mb of vram are you sure your computer can handle it My gtx  its pissing itself as I click ok I have a GTX  Do you really think that it cant run Diablo When you set your Minecraft world to Amplified Old school Runescape doesnt use the CPU so better hope you got a good CPU My Computer be like Halo  is a major offender Youre talking about minecraft arent you Meanwhile Quake with RTX enabled When a decade old game cant run because your pc is to stronk Does it run Crysis What about DeadBeefCafe for Mac Address thats my favorite Like when kings quest says it cant install because it needs like  bytes to run and your screen is displaying some number of bytes all the way across the screen World type AMPLIFIED Warning Just for fun requires beefy computer Laughs in Pentium III I love it when a game says my pc cant run a  year old game like Fallout New Vegas just cuz it has parts newer than what was around then But whatever still get super high frames Me when I play old far cry games CoD on my HP Pavilion My friend couldnt run dune  because it cannot run on bit SimCity automatically set its settings to low and said my computer might not be able to run it Tik This looks just like the dudes face who found that cat at Costco A game rhyming with fotal nor bedieval shnoo comes to mind My graphic settings in Oblivion always reset after a week Detecting GPU Using average settings Bitch please I can destroy you with mods and still have smooth FPS Im building a pc because my moms laptop crashed on the menu of TF Just installed Red Alert  and had a fatal error when I started the game I had to troubleshoot compatibility settings in order to get it working The opening intros brought back childhood memories It just sucks playing at x resolution on an ultrawide monitor I wish they remastered old games like these Its a mix of emotions playing your childhood games on your dream gaming rig haha Like minecraft Oh no wait that actually crashed last week because my pc couldnt handle it Lol tries to run game in k runs into single pixel wide text runs at fps anyways due to lack of optimization and compatibility for modern gpus And then runs like shit anyway because older games arent optimised for modern hardware Minecraft superbeefy worlds I still dont try to run them on my shirt laptop though Borderlands  crashes my RTX  keeps giving me an out of video memory error as well as low fps and stutters game doesnt run because its so old Downloaded Daggerfall today Huge download size option was  mb Crysis today be like i TI coming right up Ah Prince of Persia Warrior Within always does this xD YES Sniper Elite the first one told me that my GTX  wasnt powerful enough to play it at p ultra uanthonytcyh And you still get  FPS It amazes me that the crysis series can still push todays midrange PCs laptops and even the base PS and Xbox ones to their limit Prior to rejoining the master race last year the only game I owned on Steam was Grim Fandango Remastered which a friend had gifted to me I played it when it originally released but my computers growing up never had much gaming power at least not for current games so it didnt run well back then And the tiny ultrathin laptop I had prior to getting back into PC building could barely run it either So I when I built my PC last year it was obviously the first game I installed When it booted up I looked Manny Calavera dead in the eye and told him youre mine now old man Except for Minecraft that shit wont run on even a NASA supercomputer if you try to put it on max settings without optifine Rome Total War  runs kinda crap for me even tho my specs are technically far better than the requirements  Minecraft amplified world be like I see a Thomas the Train meme I upvote the man of culture who posted it Youre not getting it back from him Happy early

soon as the gpu gets delivered Any advice for a first time builder This is so wholesome and shows what sharing info across a community can really do Making memories As a guy who last build his pc in the s pc nowadays are ridiculously easy to build When i build mine last year i kept asking the question whre do you set the jumper pins Is that it and was laughed at Im convinced itll took me less than  minutes to build one if i have to do it again I hope to do this one day with my daughter She already loves building fiddly things Hats off to you for taking the time to research it I see no static armbands This assembly is wreckless and dangerous I still have the photos from when dad rebuilt my computer into a case and I was too lazy to do much hahah I think back to memories like that and the many gaming memories I have involving him I still thank him occasionally for teaching me the basics  Hes a great father and I love him to bits Magic the Gathering playmats make great mouse pads  Wholesome Vsauce Michael dad TIL SoloRenektonOnly has a kid When my granddaughter was eight she helped me build her PC she now works at one of the well known companys and has her CSEBGCE kids

like this is great OP bond with your son We want the specs Hes playing it Looks like you built his first PC and planning for your first This was me and my dad a few months ago I had planned my first pc build for when he would be visiting me and we spent an evening together putting it together As an old pc gamer late s he thought it was the coolest thing Wish you and your son the best I spent about  allnighters during an exam week to build my first PC Very stupid indeed but I once I started I couldnt stop Now Im majoring in computer engineering so thats coolZ I love this post so much My dad also saw my interest in PCs and said I could build one if I wanted one to learn some things but not buy one So Im like sure dad whats the budget He says Its really amazing and crazy I never would have expected a  PC and it just blew me away I was thinking maybe  to get off our old Mac Its easily the best gift I ever got Was having a really bad day this post really helped cheer me up  Enjoy it This is what its all about xB Thanks for being awesome guys  Happy to see parents like you My dad built me my first PC in the s I switched to console after than up until about  years ago I made sure to take all my parts over and build it with him he had a ball Happy for you welcome to the superior race i was hestitant building my own pc as well but it is sooo easy and fun too xB my first rig was a frankenstein monster it was a laptop that i had pulled apart and old one so i could let loose upgraded with new ramcpu and hooked it up with an external GPU it wasnt a pretty sight but it ran beautifully Upvoted for wholesomeness Very cool good bonding activity Congrats Is that a fractal design Define S Damn this is awesome I remember building my dads first computer when i was six i love it happy fathers day glad everyone could help you Nice I have a fond memory of my dad building a PC and him showing me how it worked It had a massive Nvidia case with about  fans and dual  gt graphics cards in an sli configuration I mostly sat and played my brand new Bioshock game on the Xbox  while he built it but still a good memory About  years later I knew exactly what I was doing when I built my first PC Hey mind if i ask what your hardware configuration is Crazy I have the same corsair case And i bet we have the same msi x board Both are really good Is the motherboard msi x gaming plus The backplate looks very similar if not the same Such an awesome bonding experience as shown by countless posts on this sub and even big names like Terry Crews and his son May it long live One of my fav fatherson memories growing up was me begging for a dFX Voodoo  graphics card for Xmas My parents came through but then my dad was surprised and slightly dismayed when he found the family Dell tower taken apart by a very young me trying to figure out my first PC building project It quickly became a mutual project between us and led to many more together Im calling him tomorrow and reminding him of this Stuff you never forget  I cant believe you left your son with the cable management Thats some hard fathering Glad its working for him Nice build What are the specs My dad helped me assemble my first PC when I was about  Unfortunately he was accustomed to working on cars and motorcycles leading him to overfasten one of the motherboard screws My brand spanking new motherboard would randomly reboot every half hour or so Eventually we discovered the crack and he came up with the solution attach the motherboard to the case with tie rips and plastic spacers instead It worked perfectly It was an Abit IC with a Pentium  c Good times  Thats nice dude However it took month Wtf Specs or it didnt happen Did the same work my son with help of this sub and rbuildapc Nice man Your son has a hairloss problem and me Your sons cable management is weak s Glad you and your son have ascended Congrats Just when Zen  and RTX Super cards are coming out Good job remembering the IO shield Happy Fathers Day That is fantastic I built my kids one yesterday and today me and my boy will be playing Swtor together Good times my friend both building with and for your kids Happy Fathers Day man My middle son and I recently started his journey in the PC hobby We rebuilt a computer together a few months back and I have to say there isnt a whole lot of other things in life more fulfilling than sharing a hobby with your child Weve had a lot of fun with it Last Christmas my dad got me parts to a TV and Im gonna be honest I got bored when he was taking forever to figure out the wiring so I was playing on my PS while I waited My heart My heart cant take it I did this with my dad literally with the same case and mother board holy cow Why cant I fucking have a dad like you wtf My dad handed me a controller when I was  been hardcore gamer ever since Took me  or  years to switch over to the master race but when I did my dad and I built me a rig instead of rebuilding his  year old setup Get em started early I guess Stay wholesome PCMR Thats so nice i was building a pc with my father when i was a kid suddenly one day i came home and there was this prebuild computer in the house it wasnt even good had to replace most of its part to make it decent for its age I spend so long researching and trying not to go overbudget to build it with him and he went alone to buy one at a price so above its actual value lol all my efforts to waste So looking this kind of post makes me so happy  You did whats called a pro gamer move Glad you were able to make it work I built one with my dad and it shows nothing on the monitor Still hoping we get it to work tho Thats so awesome man Good for you being that involved Great to see theres kick ass dads out there My daughter at  is asking Daddy can we build a computer for me Glad it all worked out Enjoy Happy Fathers day to you and any dad out there that reads this Jealous I always wanted to do with with my dad I grew up spending most of my youth holding a flashlight for him in the garage in  C while he built car after car While Im still in awe about how he managed to build cars from scratch hes in the same awe when he sees my computers Ive put together over the years I was hoping that one day Id be able to have him assist me with one of my builds but I dont think thats happening Plus hes turning  soon But I get to look forward to doing something like this with my own son one day hopefully when we finally decide to have a kid That is the best I have three girls and when they get older Id love to do this with them Thats awesome man Cant wait to do this with my son Thanks for sharing op rcooldads Very cool I built a box the other day for the garden and I was pumped Youre a cool dad  Dam I wish my dad was interested in my likes good in you fir being s great dad happy fathers day And remember do not be afraid to ask what you think to be stupid questions If something doesnt seem to get youll get help in minutes here The least fool proof  common sense friendly part of a first assembly is all about CPU cooling and having it blowing the air in the right direction Damn this is inspiring I hope to build a computer with my kids one day My dad helped me with my first build and it was really the only time he ever got involved with my hobby This is so wholesome My dads laptop recently stopped working so Im building him one for his birthday so we can play games together again I see them MTG playmats God ol father son bonding ay This is so fucking wholesome I think Im shedding a man tear Nicely done my father and i did this when i was younger he will remember this for the the remainder of his gamer days even if he ends uo buying pre builts down the road Ive built so many PCs the first one is special Even more so if built together with your father Its a very unique experience and you will always remember I also built my first one together with my dad more than I would say  years ago Nice family photos I remember my first build with my dad I think I was about  It is one of my favorite memories with him This guy is a true legend for doing this during Fathers day weekend Story of my first build with my father I was  and he was upgrading our family PC He wanted me to help him assemble it I love the idea He would let me put everything in place and as long as I was grounded plug the components in Well there is the tiny button configuration on the motherboard that needed to be set up a certain way I dont know why but this stuck with me I just focused on it and my dad seemed to concentrate harder for a second as well We finish putting the cover on and boot her up good to go Well a few months later I was being a little shit and my dad took away my computer time I tried but it would never boot I sat for a second and remembered that the pin configuration would prevent the boot sequence if it was not correct I opened her up put it in the configuration I remembered and booted her up It worked Well my dad comes up stairs and sits at his desk which is right next to mine and I catch his look over but not say anything I had a solid victory the kid won I shall reign supreme forever I did not see the computer for  months after that Im glad he still brings it up once or twice a year Happy fathers day Dad My son and me Best post of the year so far Thats a nice fatherson moment Happy Fathers day This is so different from my childhood where my dad used to make me build him working machines from older ones These were like  and s prior to the pentium processor My little fingers worked well in the confined space I wouldnt really call it a boding experience as I had to work alone in the garage This warms the soul Saved This is it I have that exact same t shirt Ok so he looks like hes  and you

building my first a few months ago whats inside it if you dont mind me asking Nice D congrats on the build My dad was lazy and payed someone to build it Happy fathers day Oh the memories Ive built my first pc when I was about  I always preferred pc to any consoles and I dont know why someone wouldnt Looks like a lot of fun Weve done the same about a year ago and we picked the same case and the same motherboard Its all fun and games until you fry it with static electricity Good job on being a considerate father props to you sir Does he like programming at all  Maddox is that you I just ordered my first computer parts for my build kinda like fathers day gift to me My son is only a toddler right now but he definitely has a couple of coding for toddlers books in his libary I cant wait

summer Really great case to work with Lots of spots for extra storage and easy cable management Looks like a great way to bond with your kid Nice magic mat Want to play some magic Welcome to the pcmr then Specs Awesome man I remember the first time I built mine did the same thing months and months of research each part to carefully picked Nowadays Im just like Eh this is fine Haha Hope you both had a lot of fun with it Your first is always special Savour it I assume it is like building a car engine with your dad like in the American movies Well we have no houses around where I live only apartmens So I never actually get to build a car engine And my father doesnt not know much about the computers We had some other fun things to do before he started working again though Like changing the light switches around the house making an LED keyboard etc And yes indeed anything you do with dad becomes special Happy fathers day Could I have the specs and the total cost please Cheers I like the cut of your jib Welcome to the Master race of gaming Hopefully you both learned a lot and get to game a ton in the future Must be pretty awesome to have a gamer dad  Dad points I had to build my own at age  OoF Happy Fathers Day I teared up Happy fathers day My daughter is only  months old I hope we get to do something like this when shes older Dope I know next to nothing about building a PC but Ive always wanted to be able to do it I see gaming PCs for sale and the prices are astronomical then I see posts here about people building them for a third of the cost Any recommendations on good sites or reading material where to start to learn this kind of thing This just made me happy for no reason Feel like it deserves a look from rwholesomememes What are the specificationsparts list Now you can berate people with the smug why dont you build your own PC type diatribe whenever you see someone in a forum discussing Apple or console products Well done Happy fathers day Your son will remember that moment for the rest of his life Dude this is sick One of my fondest memories with my dad is when him and me would build the family computer We had a local computer store and wed do the research together hed buy the parts and wed assemble it and figure out the inevitable driver issues with Windows  Now my dads getting older and I hope to build several more computers with him Wish my dad would do this with me tbh i wish my dad didnt run off before i was born but shit happens wish i could afford one Happy Fathers Day What was the cost comparison to building vs buying packaged Can you please share the details of your build Hey OP is that a Phantek Enthoo case Looks really similar to mine Congrats on being a great father to your son Cant wait to do this with my daughter and son  A few years to go still Thanks for posting awesome dad another dad from another country What was the most useful subreddit Most important question AMD or Intel What resources did you look up Watched youtube videos my dad was a real shitheel but we had this kind of moment in the s he was bald too and now im bald its like poetry it rhymes Aww happy fathers day Youre an awesome dad and this is something your son will always remember doing with his old man Kudos for putting forth the effort man A lot of kids dont get moments like this with their dad Give it a few years and this will be a precious memory Have a happy Fathers Day Youre breathtaking Taking a guess from that backplate thats a MSI b mobo Damn you are one goddamn awesome dad Jesus like you are really cool Im happy for you and your Son Game on my dudes Lovely What will you be using the PC for I want to build a PC for D rendering and would love to have my nephew help me kind of a father figure I can do the research but would love to know if you have any quick tipsresources Wow is this a picture of you sent from the future My wife asked me lol I damn well hope so What are the specs Specs This is my first Fathers Day

done you for creating amazing memories with your boy Awesome guys Happy fathers day to ya sir Enjoy the new gaming PC looks great I think its better for him to build it You just need to guide him how to do  Best dad ever To me this is refreshing I dont know if its just me but I hardly see post like this on trending Its nice Really great As a kid I my das had no idea about computers and allways thought it is a big black box where the kid can play games As I got older I played less Yet I hope I will be able to have a kid and talk about computers with him when he is old enough Months and weeks What even is that Congrats on building a PC You sure as hell picked a rough first case to work with though speaking from experience lol Surprised reddit was kind to you Newcomers and people who dont know shit are generally raped and downvoted to death did this with my daughter about a year ago she never had a console she never had a TV in her room she saved her birthday and Christmas present money for  years as well as other savings I made her research the parts and pick and build it herself when she was building it there was this moment when I was remembering ancient memories i had with my father when I was young helping him with some DIY around the house and I knew it was going to be one of those forever memories that shapes a person It was the first time I really felt like a father like I was going to be remembered after I died I hope computers like this dont change in the future so I can have this type of bond with child Liess pretty sure this is was cheaper than that Pro Stand  That kid looks like what he needs is more time behind a screen Wait your sun looks very similar to a guy I know is his name Florian Building something is a great fatherson activity  and it made for such a wholesome picture cheers dude enjoy it both of you We have the same case and mobo They look identical from this angle Your son looks old Please for the love of god lay your tower in its side when youre working on it Its easier to see because more light gets in youll have more leverage and its less precarious Both of you are clothed minus points Both of you arent grounded with a clip Minus moar points Jokes aside great job Hope you didnt have any problems getting it running My fave problem with a new build is having to call customer service to find the correct jumpers to reset to even get to POST Srsly some mobo manuals dont even have info on which jumper is what I had to do that once  wote in pen in the manual which was what It really sucks when the internet doesnt even have the information to what you need cuz the mobo is brand new Did the same thing with my Dad when I was a kid Nothing quite like a fresh PC build Specs My son and l built his first PC together in  This week he will receive the results of his Computer Science degree from Cambridge Enjoy these times together Wholesome as hell Sick build Yo I have the same case as you I too have been building my own pc and am getting the parts on a monthly basis to save money This post wouldve had very different comments if this exact post with the description was posted on rroastme I think I have the exact same case fractal and mainboard msi D I am extremely happy with it Gotta start somewhere Ive only bought one premade PC and it was my first in the s Since then Ive built all of them Back in the day when OCing meant painting jumper circuits on PCBs with automotive window defroster paint And scouring CPU sources to get the exact datetimefactory unit that might have the best chance at massive OCs Now my son is learning the tricks Welcome to the Masterrace fkn noobs Fractal Design Nice choice Honestly you should have made him do all the work  thats what fathers do or at least in my experience of which I value Disregard the funinteresting partdoes building a pc with comparable components cost more or less than just purchasing one at like Best Buy or something I dont see how it could save substantial money Good stuff man I remember building my first computer with my old man was an amd k and tnt was junk but it was mine and worked and kicked off my carrer in IT Interestingly the old man is rubbish on computers now but he helped me back then Cant wait to build one with my son or daughter  And then you have my dad who felt proud plugging his computer in right Youre awesome Can you link all the parts you used in the build That is really cool My son  wants to build a computer after finding my husbands s Gateway in our back room I told him to start researching before buying parts The build your own PC book at out library is from   Glad to know help is out there Hey Thats the exact case I had for my first build Still using it too Hope I get to tackle new and confusing tech when Im old with my kid who will probably roll his eyes when I dont know where the holographic graphics card goes lol This is the one thing I wish my dad had done with me Hes a great man but never took interest in my interests Keep it up good sir Happy Fathers Day Wish I could do this  This is a wonderful project and experience that you two shared My son and I built a computer together as well It was a combination gift for Christmas  he got a pretty decent gaming pc I got the time to share with him Two and a half years later he still refers to it as the computer we built even though its his only computer I bet you are looking forward to the next build The best part is that computers are an ongoing project and experience for you to continue bonding This is awesome I so badly want to do this with my boy Hes just turned  and is into minecraft and hes starting to ask questions about how computers are built i absolutely love this reminds me of my first time buldiing legos with my dad and grandpa  Man Id never let my kid grow a nicer beard than mine thats emasculating Hell yes MTG it is fun isnt it but it feels like your doing a heart surgery the whole time and the patient might die i remember the first thermal pasting thought i might burn a  dollar cpu Hell yea Cant wait until I can do this with my kids but they are  years old and  months old so I have a while Do you have any pictures of your catcats I remember my first PC my Dad bought for me Was rocking a mhz computer on board video  kips connection Playing Starcraft and Beta CS brought it to a LAN and it never turned on again Dad bought my friends old rig for me  Mhz voodoo  mb stick of ram and upgrade to a cable connection Was a life changing experience Planning on squeezing him pretty hard when I hug him today So youre not playing battleship Very cool OP What games does he like to play right now I tried this with my  year old so we could have a good old bonding experience like this His interest waned as soon as the cool looking boxes were opened All worked out in the end because we still get to game together on something we built together Are you guys building my PC I have the same motherboard and case N

network administrator about the problem Theres  things wrong with that approach  The network administrator is the one who caused the problem  The network administrator has no fucking clue why this problem is occurring  The network administrator is the moron currently reading this message Acces denied I OWN YOU It says MemeJoke but this is no joke Only sadness Still happens to me on windows  rip  sudo The number of times I have to manually select run as admin despite being logged in as admin and having that option set as default on the apps is bloody infuriating I get that Windows  is just trying to protect me from my own stupidity but dammit let me be stupid if I want to be This usually gets a listen here ya little shit uttered around my house net user Administrator activeyes FTFY This shit happens all the time with dll files on windows  Ive resorted to sketchy third party apps to get around these ownership blocks and cursed out MS support staff who dont even know that its a problem for end users Reminded me of a security bug in Windows XP where instead of typing the login password on the login screen you press CTRL  ALT  DEL twice and it will switch to an alternative login screen and there just type in  admin  in the username field and leave the password empty it logs you right in Microsoft didnt fix it until Vista rolled out Run permissions on the drive Use subinacl Why is the user holding Patricks ID when Patrick is Windows in this example  I want to post a snarky Linux joke but I had to unfuck enough permission mess so I pass This is fucking perfect This hits close to home Maybe you should contact your system administratorhttpsiimgurcomzBSVnEmp I didnt know something can sum up my experience so precisely well Just use Windows Diagnostics to find the solution to the problem for you Im sure itll work just fine Fucking hell windows is hopeless sometimes ITS MY FILES AND I WANT TO MODIFY THEM NOW Takeown and icacls are your friends As a superquick primer on NT permissions think of NT and later as a giant jerk of an operating system It hates your guts and it wants you to die When its looking through permissions it looks for any excuse it can come up with to deny access Anytime theres an explicit Denied if your account fits that criteria youre denied It doesnt matter how many ways youre allowed if youre denied in any way too bad so sad drop dead In general in other words dont use Deny permissions because NT is a jerk If you assign an EveryoneDeny permission nobody has access to that file The owner can remove that permission but until he or she does aint nobody touching it Not even an admin can remove that permission either only the owner An admin would have to Take Ownership which admins can always do and then remove the permission to restore access From there once you get past the Deny check you need an explicit Allowed for whatever youre doing Not being mentioned in permissions isnt sufficient you need something that matches one of your attributes and grants permission Roughly speaking this is how it decides whether to grant permission  Are you denied in any way Drop dead  Are you allowed for each and every permission youre asking for Okay you have access Dammit  Otherwise drop dead edit to add after reading downthread some more If youre already an admin and you still dont have access to something the permissions arent giving either your user account or Administrators the permission you need Further if you cant access the file you probably cant change its permissions The thing is the owner of a file can always change the perms even if theyre otherwise not allowed to Thats the skeleton key If you own a file you can modify its permissions So if youre locked out of a file first you have to take ownership Once you own it then you edit the permissions to give yourself normally Full Control and probably remove any Deny permissions which arent used very often because theyre dangerous From there you should be able to do whatever you want with the file This lets you do terrible things to system files at least in Windows   Im not sure if Win adds any new protection layers or not You can abuse this power to render your machine unbootable pretty easily and in fact can hose things up badly enough to need a full OS reinstall So be careful with taking ownership and editing permissions Youve been locked out of that file for a reason and be sure you understand what that reason was before you fck with it It may be a bad reason one thats safe to ignore but know what it is so you can be certain had to manually restore the files of microsoft store after they got deleted by trying to repair it in Settings Thats when you boot into your Linux partition and delete any file you want Even worse in windows  I tried running Task Manager as admin to end a process Didnt work Tried starting it as admin through command prompt Error this program requires elevation Elevated the command prompt Error this program requires elevation You just cant fucking win This is why even Windows users should have a Linux USB stick in their toolkit Quickly boot it up to deleterearrangerepartitionwhatever and done Windows file protection can go fuck itself This is why I like Linux Not only will Linux allow you to shoot yourself in the foot it will load the gun and place it in your hand Relevantish xkcd httpxkcdcom Relevant means in this case that Windows is a dick everywhere Just use Linux then you can log in as root and fuck everything up without any access denials Ooh man this happened to me recently So frustrating Actual response UAC takes away kernels ticket flags like administrator and domain admin on domain PCs This is to protect ham fisted people from themselves You can kill Explorer and run it as administrator to work around a lot of that Or get psexec and run stuff as system oh yeah the false illusion of power Ill be the guy so give Linux a go Got the same problem when I cloned a window partition of an almost dead drive Not entirely and windows doesnt wanted to go on the partition that he just repaired Use process explorer to confirm the file is not in use if it is kill the associated process if not take ownership via cacls Too real  You have no idea how much this pisses me off Those folders nobody can access is where Microsoft keeps all of the spyware Wow this scene fits so perfectly for this meme love it Happened to me I am admin but lost permissions to my whole C drive It says Im an admin with full permissions and it always has said that but now I have to reapply the permissions and it doesnt even let me do it for everything on the drive meirl deleted This is not even a joke its the truth Fucking windows Sudo make me a sandwich Ironically it is MacOS that has this problem more than Windows Apple has locked a lot of stuff behind root access for example you cant modify the Englishlproj folder default user template without logging in as root This is a big reason I switched to Linux as my main OS Sudo fucking do what I tell you Yeah still happens for me in windows  even when i open it with elevatedi mean administrator cmdbut i love windows not because it is easy to operate but beacuse its looks goodi liked its graphical interface You have to take ownership of the file by accessing the security properties Hate it every time it happens lel Repost Just kidding this is still one of my favourite memes This shit drives me crazy Sorry I cant let you save the file you just edited Oh you want to replace this file that I just didnt let you edit Sure thing REPOST ALERT I like when you do taskkill f and the program still doesnt die Like does microsoft not understand the meaning of the words kill and force I seriously cant recall a single time Ive kill  something in linux and it wasnt dead within seconds windows xp CHANGE FILE  changes file wont deny the access no pop up nothing Just view this short ad to access your file Whats in the box Your admin privileges First you must take ownership of the file or folder This is so accurate Happens to me every fucking day at work  Window  is so retarded I had to download administrative features in a patch file to turn off certain security features that were throttling my performance Hey Microsoft fix your fucking garbage  disk issue or give me Windows  back I hate it when solving one issue is like a  step process that makes me feel like a computer technician We really did peak with operating OS a long time ago Its too bloated now Microsoft rushing out  for the touch screen trend was the worst thing they have ever done Its been downhill from there I thank god we still have legacy compatability though On the last panel Access denied The windows xp error sound pops in my head Cannot delete this file as it is currently opened by another process SO TELL ME WHICH ONE My favourite one is not even admin related Logged in as USER an account belonging to the administrators group and the owner of file A ME OK delete file A Windows cant Me why not Windows you need permission from USER to do that Me I am USER Windows yep Me okay take ownership and delete it Windows youre already the owner Me fine Give USER full control Windows cant You need permission from either USER or the owner to do that Bangs head on keyboard every windows httpiimgurcomWttwnHgifv Just install gentoo bro Right click file properties security advanced change ownership select current user apply to all folders and sub folders Bang now you have access hoping someone will see this This happens because you have an administrator account but not the administrator account What you need to do is take over the builtin admin account However this is not recommend if you have potato brain and are prone to fuck things up the admin account is there like a last resort in case you lock yourself out of access or something I usually do this when I do a new windows install so that I can just start using that one and not already have a lot of data and stuff on another account in use You can google it but if I remember the general details are  Install windows and create a dummy account to start your st session  Enable builtin Admin account  Log out  Log in as Admin  Take over the account by setting your own passwordname as you want  Delete dummy account  Done Now you have UNLIMITED POWER not really there are still always annoying file ownerships and such Now I dont have to deal with annoying Run as Administrator popups anymore  edit a word It be your own OS smh This again Spent about  minutes trying to get Corsair utility engine working had the same thing happen to me I just went through an hour of stress trying to figure out why every time I closed windows explorer the quick access tab would be empty when I reopened it Still dont know how I fixed it but hey at least its not happening Yes TrustedInstaller I had to change the ownerships of some COM components and registry keys from TrustedInstaller to admin to make an application work correctly without errors in the event log Download LockHunter  rofl ugh this is the one thing i hate about windows let me fucking modify my files and drives i should be an admin of my own PC   utippr Its not admin locked its system locked Thats the account that logins in at the login screen then logs out when you login Except it doesnt You can use Handleexe from livesysinternalscomhttpslivesysinternalscom to kill any file handle httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvJDUjeRwnU This will give you access to any file httpssscomnttakeownhtml the command httpswwwhowtogeekcomhowtowindowsvistaaddtakeownershiptoexplorerrightclickmenuinvista the way to easily run it aw man imma just stick with my preinstalled candy crush then  Hey uCybrTech This is now the top post on reddit It will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts Despite how annyoing this can be is that really a bad thing You are criticizing Windows cancel or allow Put the hard drive in another computer and enjoy the this folder requires administrator privileges  and click continue to view the goodness Why is the id card a picture of Patrick if its the other guy trying to prove hes an admin Confused me for a little longer than Id like to admit I just burst out laughing at this reading it in Patricks voice on Task Manager i couldnt stop gta san andreas even with admin permissions Made me rage so many times Something something rlinuxmasterrace But unfortunetly Im a gamer  Then there is the person that leaves a comment saying I dont know the solution and nothing else Real helpful Im having the same problem Any help would be great Edit nevermind Fixed it myself what did you do Please tell me Im having the same issue I too am having the same issue please share Ive had this issue since I updated what was your solution This thread has been locked for inactivity and has been marked as SOLVED Every fucking time Or someone posts a link to a supposedly duplicate question but its not exactly the same issue and your post ends up gaining no traction and getting no anwser THANKS I DEFINITELY DIDNT SEE THAT EXACT ONE BEFORE I DECIDED TO POST MYSELF Amazon product questions are my favorite Q Will this cpu cooler fit an Intel K A I dont know I have an AMD Ryzen and I decided on a different cooler The problem always ends up being resolved by watching an  year olds p Youtube video If someone is good at photoshop they should make the hand come out of the water clasp the other hand then they both sink together That would be dank Also Weird works for me Nvm fixed it post locked Those arent so bad at least they bump the thread Its way worse when you find an old thread with your exact issue that ends with nvm guys I figured it out Or even worse I PMed you how to fix it Like why in tf did you not just comment on the persons post like a helpful human being would do For me it generally goes  Ask for help online  comment on post  I have never heard of this happening well good luck Generally I figure out my own solution which usually ends up breaking something else But that has been my experience asking for help online More like look it up on google Damnit DenverCoder My insert thing here works fine  ASKING FOR HELP ONLINE WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS DO THAT INSTEAD NOBODY DOES THIS ANYMORE THIS HAS BEEN ASKED BEFORE The worst are the people who arent having an issue respond by saying how they cant understand how people could be having an issue and end up gloating in a way thats clearly obnoxious Hey is anyone else having trouble maintaining fps in Division  I have a decently high end rig NAH BRUH IM RUNNING A TI AND IM GETTING AT LEAST FPS MAXED OUT AT K YOU SURE ITS NOT YOU I pray theres a special place in hell for people like this You dont ask for help on the internet If you do you will wait a long time for help What you do is make a statement Question Does it matter what type of hdmi cable I buy No answer Statement Getting a gold plated hdmi cable is worth the money no you idiot reasons I posted on stackoverflow Got an answer for my problem that worked in the first mins I was so thrilled and I feel like this will never happened again  Or when someone responds with found a solution but they dont say how First results from google Try googling it I PMd you the solution Nvm I figured it out Here is a link to the solution  Not Found This post has been edited NVM I fixed it As always there a relevant xkcd httpsxkcdcomhttpsxkcdcom Im a girl and have a problem  comments Another favorite is Try searching the forums Lol ikr Like whats the point of just adding same problem lol he knows its a problem Is this loss To be fair its not always unhelpful when someone says Im having the same problem because that can help determine if its an issue only with your setup or not For me it is always people telling me I need to do everything that Ive already tried Thought this was rmeirlmeirl Or you google a problem it takes you to a forum where some smug arsehole is telling the OP just google it Not helpful dude Im having this problem Ive tried many things including x and nothing works Just do x retard Thank you for your insightful advice This information can be used by web applications to help apply a weight to the issue After using certain web applications it becomes pretty clear how this can be beneficial  Github sticks out the most to me as a programmer but Im sure theres others for gaming that do it too Lmao this was too real But then when you finally find that magical thread with that one beautiful person who has the answer youre looking for its a godsend Finally figured it out on my own thanks for the help everyone DOESNT LIST WHAT FINALLY ENDED UP WORKING Never mind I found the solution Doesnt write another word This has been marked as a duplicate post Nevermind I figured it out thread locked xB xB  asks question in forum First response  use the search function Followed by useless comments that  times eventually leads to the answer  pages later The thread has been marked duplicate by bla bla bla Its worse when someone says I dont have an issue with it I dont give a fuck if you dont have an issue thats not helping anyone now is it Same Im having the same problem as you Edit Nvm fixed it Have you tried turning it off and on Someone was asking how tall was a certain monitor someone replied with I dont know but you can raise and lower it Anything Apple related also has a guy paddling by in a canoe talking about something completely unrelated MY DAUGHTER CANT SEE IMAGES I EMAIL HER and the like Suppose it helps knowing it isnt only you Even worse is the never mind guys I figured it out No further explanation Inactive user andor anonymous reply I can relate to this so much right now I cant get audio to work for this game called slime rancher Check the wiki Google My favorite is when the OP comments that the problem is fixed but there are twelve responses and OP didnt bother to specify which one worked Lmao this has happened to me more times then I care to mention Why they gotta do me like that What really is happening is the person having the same problem jumping into the water next to you stretching out his arm too Could increase attention from others when a few more hands rise out of the water or when someone is commenting i have something similiar to this problem and than people procede to help him out in your thread ignoring you while the other guy gets his peoblem solved and you are there like hmm guys what about me  Post asking for help My CPU is overheating Response aRe yOuR gPU dRIvErs uP tO dATe I have sent you the fix in pm  We suffer togetherhttpsiimgurcomgjDTWKjpg Amazon FAQs are the worst for this Edit found the solution on my own Why dont you google it Reading the post  years later by someone else and it is locked  archived Nevermind I figured it out xB This post is marked as solved xB Its far worse when you find a post from  with the exact problem you have and then the OP had replied to his own post with Nevermind Solved it HOW MADA FAKA HOW I usually get a response gromadki oh I am sorry but you need to know page rules before you post and deletes my post Being a Linux user here is a solution but it is a forum posted  Oh and the utility that is mentioned has forked  times in the past decade because of asinine open source political reasons so none of the commands work any more The hand drowning in the water needs to try and grasp the other hand with  fingers to symbolize the fact that most posts for help barely give you any information to help the person trying to give support xB PLEASE HELP my PC stopped working what is wrong xB Thanks for that boat load of info I can use to help you Anyone who feels this way please come hang out in the Daily Simple Questions thread on this sub its a great place to lurk around and pick up some useful advice and terminology I swear once in a while we even manage to solve an actual problem If that high five was given by The Todd the drowner would just gracefully levitate out of the water as a result Sometimes its nice to know youre not the only one experiencing an issue Its the times that noone says Im having the same problem that should worry you The worst are the kids health question forums Theyre  of nothing but other parents stating that they have the same issue and then they ask for the solution Or they give you a very vague solution and when you get confused they never reply back Sometimes its nice not being alone IKR I have the same problem smh Ive found the solution leaves without a trace I miss usenet for this reason It was easier to get answers to real technical problems there Pmd you the fix  I have the same problem Happens to me with the App blocked by your graphics hardware No one can give straight answers to my issue Yo I have the solution PM me Last online  years ago Like  of obscure programming questions you have to do the needful Some do it to bump the thread Just spent  days with Microsoft on the phone trying to determine an intermittent failure After I was done I updated  different stack overflow tickets this post is really targeted at all the amd users who updated past  and have been struggling for their computer to not crash You forgot to put Im sorry in the last frame Ive had this happen to me before Happens every time Its the worst when they dont respond with their solution or when they post the solution with like a photobucket link or imgur link THATS EXPIRED  Sorry I do this alot xB Oh and the posts that does have a solution have a link to a  upload on megaupload damn I was going to bash on this for being a repost but its been long enough since Ive seen it This happens to me too This pisses me off so much When you see a notification saying you got a message on your post and it just says Yeah I got the same issue Either this or some one jumping at the chance to say well its your own flat dumbass Where are the people just going That sucks bro an xkcdhttpsxkcdcom for every occasion I have this same problem Same thing when I ask for help with my depression I have the same problem It bumps the thread and makes people more interested when you see a comment in the thread and also lets peoplebugfixers know that its more than just one person that has the problem double middle finger for reviving dead post that was never answered posted a new question this question has been answered before link to dead post that was never answered Or people try but cant figure it out either so you ask even more people on the internet and they also cant help and youre equally stumped So you then drown in annoyance and frustration me the past week lol Interesting political compass Exactly how I feel with DMC not loading on mission  Who knows Change the helping hand to a middle finger with Google it you idiot Thanks I figured it out end of post Could just buy a console I was having a stupid issue with my computer and while searching almost ended up doing this exact thing but caught myself This is not particularly important but I must say that three months ago I visited the exhibition of the artist who painted this picture Then the inevitable I found the solution to this and never posting the solution Or the guy handing the drowning man a cinderblock I dont have that problem Therefore nothing is wrong Just die Yeet This is why I always edit my question posts when I figure out an answer When I find a thread of  people saying I have the same problem and they never posted a solution The pain Use the search bar Or when you type in your troubleshooting steps and someone tells you to try what you already did How about the LOL why would want to do that posts Im glad im not the only one Its how we feel when some rude knob replies to a request for help Why dont you Google it will you  Nevermind I figured it out Dated  years ago and the user has zero additional posts WHAT WHAT DID YOU FIGURE OUT PLEASE TELL ME Even worse is when OP comes back and says nvm I fixed it or when there is a deleted comment and everyone is saying it foxed it for them I love this new meme format The worst is recipe commenters Yum Definitely making this week MomUser on March   Well how the hell was it  rdepression  nvm i figured it out bye guys im not sharing the solution Better yet they edit it saying they found the solution but never post it Whats worse is when someone goes off on a tangent completely unrelated I thought this was rmeirlmeirl Hey can you help me with this problem i have Original poster AHH soled it now Everyone else  but how OP I get the same feeling looking at the why is my PC locking up threads Some things are beyond a simple thread reply well golly gee it works for methere is a special place in hell between pol pot and hitler for the arseholes who post that one for some reason the need to relate and fit in has become more important than offering help where it is desperately needed nvmnd fixed it Same thing with those fuckers asking Why would you need to do that Fortnite forms I want fix A A is shit just try B Super helpful OP Help I cant swim Someone toss me a life preserver Commenter  Well Im not drowning I dont see a problem here Commenter  LOL life preservers who even uses those anymore Get a life raft Commenter  Im staying above the water just fine with the trimaran I built myself I have the same problem I have exactly the same problem that or WHY DONT YOU JUST BUY A NEW ONE  I dont like your problem and will explain to you why pp  year old videos with  sound system playing have helped me with my computer issues far more than any thing else has Stack overflows the worst you ask a question and they answer like you just asked them how to breath I dont actually want to help you I just want you to know that my problem is harder than yours K bye Theres even worse When they do reply only to start questioning if your problem really is the problem without answering anything You sure it is not something else Then proceed to discuss with other community members who comment on their theory also not answering the original post and until page  or  you will not read anything useful about your problem Then the thread just dies off  the end Nothing was solved There are millions of forum threads getting sidetracked like this Im having the same problem Had a question one time on StackOverflow wrote it well showed the topic that says You should do that with  upvotes and anoter same topic that says You shouldnt do that with  upvotes Guys marked as Duplicate showing me the link to the topic that I mentionned and downvoted me Thanks bro that was so usefull Or another time asking something close but not the same as a topic by mentionning to people that its not the same question Got downvoted and marked as duplicate Just read my fing question bro until the end At least it pushes the post Someone informing you that theyre not having the problem is actually helpful If others in the same situation are not having the issue you are having you can rule out the hard or software youre having issues with is at fault and that the cause of your problem is somewhere in your hard or software ie that youre probably doing something wrong yourself I know its hard to accept that and the kneejerk reaction is to feel defensive and attacked but that doesnt change the facts xB REEEE Sometimes statements of Im having the same problem pressures the support of the product that you are having problems with to help you A lot of answers in forums be it places like Reddit or product forums are basically Im not having a problem its just you get a new computer herpderp when often the problem has a legitimate cause out of your control and that has nothing to do with your computer itself Or you google something and find a thread with the only response being try googling out before you ask Exactly I started a thread on the Windows  support forum a few years ago about audio issues I was having Ive since figured out the issue but I cant find the thread to update it Makes me feel guilty from time to time In case anyones wondering about the issue audio would stop playing through headphones seemingly without cause Turns out every time my laptop went into sleep mode headphones would bug out Solved by disabling hibernate when laptop lid closes I have the same problem PMd you the fix Im having the same problem rprogrammerHumor would appreciate this I have the solution just DM me Same problem  its almost as if no one cares to provide solutions and its everyones jobs to apparently figure it out themselves or blame someone else for it and its not their jurisdiction Even worse is when they just upvote your post without leaving a comment Im getting some serious deja vu I saw this exact post with nearly identical comments a few weeks ago I dont think this is true I mean in the Programming Community questions get answered all the time Use me as an f in the chat button Even worse is finding someone asking a question and the only answer is someone telling them to just google it I got this exact same problem My favorite is that the person with the problem has another post that says never mind solved it and nothing else You see the perfect question on amazon with one reply I dont know I got it as a gift for my nephew Or linking to an article that has been removed Ikr Im having the same problem Thread is  years old with no solution Forgot to mention that the comment is actually a necro  years later than the OP with no further responses and it is the first Google result when you search for that problem They should drown together Either that or helpful comments are buried by memes and jokes I still dont know what is wrong with my blue yeti I generally figure it out myself and reply to my own thread as a way of giving back a little for all the useful stuff memes Ive found on the internet Its always a YouTube video made in  with no sound and instructions typed out on notepad with a hundred views that fixes it Or when you post question gets downvoted for no reason at all read the community guidelines So does this post Seriously I see it like  times a week Yo deadass fuck the people that say I dont know the solution but the people that say Im having the same problem are lit bruh I know that Im not alone and we can assist each other if we find a fix My favorite are the guys who berate the OP for not using Google Thanks for adding unnecessary noise If youre not going to answer the question please dont write anything deleted NVM solved it myself Sometims programs make you scroll to the end of the ToS before you can continue The End key is really helpful then Pretty sure that having you not read them is the point Theyre deliberately dense and long so you cant really understand what youre signing up for since in some places terms of services can actually override things that are generally considered as consumer rights Ask a silly question get a silly answer Because there isnt enough time in a persons life to actually read all the ToS they agree to Theres a reason most of that stuff isnt enforceable anyway Its because courts know that no sane person will read them This reminds me of that program where you need to accept the ToS before installation and if you press I accept too fast it locks you out for  minutes so that you have time to read it Its just me or the penultimate square on every sys comic is PC always silent and smiling And that is why all my terms and conditions are GPL BSD Apache MIT and Creative Commons Luckily terms and conditions dont hold up in court simply because you cant expect anyone to actually read it all In civilised nations additional agreements dealing with the usage of a product that are not signed as part of the actua purchase agreement are automatically null and void as far as I know this restricts the club of civilised nations to Germany and Austria They dont ask if you have read them They asked if you accept them If you like to see more comics you can see them at Systemcomics on Instagram I remember when we got our first family computer My dad got my brother and I Starcraft to play on it While I was installing it he was watching me so that he could learn how to install software on the PC As he was watching he was reading everything out loud before I was able to click the next button Well it came to the terms and conditions he went and grabbed his reading glasses sat there and read the WHOLE terms and conditions out loud so that he fully understood what we were getting into Theres been a couple of important cases wherein the courts have ruled a user cant be expected to read and understand a lengthy legal document like an EULA and abide unquestioningly with it especially when it goes against common sense eg stipulations modifying files that are on your own computer which for all intents and purposes are mine in the view of a layman If I recall the corporate argument was they should have talked to their lawyer while the winning counterpoint was you didnt make a lawyer cosign it nor any form of notary so you clearly didnt object before Seems like a lot of EULA stipulations by major companies go unenforced because theyre afraid of setting precedent against themselves that their terms and conditions need to be digestible to the layman or they cannot sell directly to the layman All it takes is for one major case to set the precedent and all of a sudden that weird hundredpage contract everyone signed doesnt mean jack fuck anymore They use it to ban people from private services but avoid using it in an actual courtroom setting for fear that it gets blown up carte blanche And then the guy ends up locked in a month subscription contract with hidden fees Anyone ever read them  everytime i have to accept this it reminds me of south park episode Theyre forced to include it for legal reasons They dont care if you actually read it or not Same could be said for Privacy Statements Terms and conditions at my company is  words Who is going to read that Theyre gonna own the rights to our freedom one day through terms and conditions I had a buddy in rd grade complain about how long the reading was before playing runescape I was so confused and eventually figured out he was reading the terms and conditions lmao these things are hardly ever enforceable anyway I sometimes read them Reminds me of the Crash Team Racing release on Friday  pages of agreements when you first boot it up It would be evil if someone made terms and conditions where you would have to enter in a specific phrase to get past it The trick is the specific phrase would be somewhere in the middleend of terms of conditions maybe on like page  out of  So the only way to get past would be to read the terms and conditions and find that phrase The fastest readers are people who read the terms and conditions they can read  whole pages in under a second do you agree to give me your liver Ah yes the ToS This feels wholesome for some reason Lets be real they do it just because they have to Good thing that the computer is not sentient and barely sapient at all else Id be afraid of being judged Yes Happy Computer is happy to do what you tell it to I wonder if this would hold up in court like I pressed the end key without looking and hit accept Its the equivilant of not writting your signature on the line on a contract always It works for me if it works for you Love it This is me every fucking time  I loved the comic but the colors are way too bright try adding a little saturation itll make it more easy on the eyes The thing is you cant access the thing you want without accepting so you really have no choice  So true nobody reads that LOL P It certainly gets people used to signing unilateral contracts noncritically  Even if I read it I still cant understand it Did any one else read this in BMOs voice Who is going to read through  pages of TOS Shit needs simplified Haha never thought of that SO WELL DRAWN THOSE EXPRESSIONS Image if one of terms is that you give your soul to them for free and the only condition is no backsies Idk what the hell Ive signed for years I wouldnt be surprised if my first born and wife gets taken away any day now Every time I forget to click the I have read the terms and conditions boxhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchtimecontinuevIdtKbqOmkw You read them all You must be a robot The original lie Reminds me of Yes Man I really felt this way when I wiped my pc with an actual Sony Vegas  license on it This is the most relatable post ever Unexpected rofflinetv The EU You must be  years old to accept Terms and Conditions The rest of the world You have to be born in order to accept Terms and Conditions  minutes later your trying to sell your steam account on Facebook and people dont care or call you out You can not read them  Rt There should be a quiz after you press done Funny now do a comic about the demonic lawyer that writes these contracts in credit card language instead of something normal humans can understand Keyboards just need a key to scroll to the end and accept TOS and TAC I call it the TACTOS key So you agree to be a humancentipad So common most do that even many dont realize when there are updates to those policies How do yall have your specs in the top line I try and I advise others to as well shout out to the  people who actually read the terms and conditions for real Also sounds like GovernmentMilitary Web Based Training Click click click click click Do you agree you understand all of this Congrats httpstosdrorghttpstosdrorg Thank you for installing the required software for the hardware you just purchased In six months we will be pushing out a mandatory update that will force you accept a new EULA wether you like it or not You wont be able to use your hardware until you update and accept whatever whim suits us at the time We will be sure to push out another mandatory update when we want to change the ELUA again God forbid we have agency over the hardware we own Once it informed me that wow it took you only  seconds to read it  I always at least skim the terms of service Honestly Ive never seen anything too objectionable I really dislike it when they say theyll log my IP address on some sites but even then I can connect over a VPN or Tor and resolve that Otherwise Ive never seen anything I would call horrible i always brush over them especially privacy policies weird flex but ok I only read conditions The new Crash Team Racing game has over  pages of terms and conditions that you have to manually slog through onebyone Its insane Well thats how we all act Imagine if they gave you a quiz after accepting I would read them if they were presented the same way as they are on Itch io I would just scroll all the way to the bottom as well like the Army dont ask dont tell In future when every website if there is any website have a built in AI Machines will call us liars And AI revolution begins  Maybe not make it over  pages written in a tiny dont no spacing and in a language that is hard to understand Service  Your funeral I love this but Im not giving rpcmtrashterace an upvote because rconsolemasterrace Uhhhhhh Upvoting from  to k is soooo satisfying why wont it read Lets not forget default night mode Paying for online services is one of the biggest cons consoles ever pulled and they did it because they could get away with it I already pay a fee to access Internet services Its called my Internet bill  dollars a year Hardly I spend all the dollars every  months or so technically the steam news popups every time you log in are advertisements Does anyone else feel like the voice chat in Apex Legends is like a bad handheld radio connection Its entertaining to watch reddit go back and forth between who the hate and who they love I remember isnt wasnt long ago when Gabe was at the center of reddits anger for something that I cant exactly remember what Then it was EA again then it was Bioware then Bethesda now its Blizzard but we love Steam and Gabe again Amazing a little while ago steam was a target for hate epic store came along with the metro fiasco and now everyone loves steam We will never be taken seriously if the community changes opinions in a matter of weeks  Before Epic Store Steam is trash they dont even care about consumers these reviews are bullshit store is full of mobile game garbage After Epic Store Lord Gaben you are strong and handsome and smart I love you But really The ingame browser needs an overhaul Steam is good but it doesnt mean that we dont need more competition i mean there is the whole drm issue that would be nice if steam puts an incentive for games to allow running without steam which gog has the upper hand in that regard of course HOWEVER i can not understand how console players actually justify paying those criminals just to play games online through the internet that they actually already pay for how is that possible how can one justify this console paywall Let the circlejerk begin Steam is only technically the best because all of the other options are still somehow worse or cant gain enough traction Steam is still terrible tho You never actually own your games in the same way you own other software you might download If you do anything to piss Valve off or they simply decide to they can block access to your account losing access to potentially thousands of dollars of games all without needing to give you a reason No ads is literally a store Well its a store they want your money theyre not going to charge you an entry fee are they Those points also apply to the Epic Store Free Games No Adds Unlimited Downloads  per year and you missed the bad points online DRM full of broken zeroeffort games occasional false positive vac bans Linux  support  It pains me that you would bring up the ingame browser I fucking hate that thing I wish it couldwould be exactly what we use outside of chrome No ads What do you call the front page popups and random items for some percentage off of a game are we just gonna ignore all the stuff steam doesnt do well or what Free games If youre referring to MOBAs and similar microtransaction shit then its a bad argument those are free in all platforms Yes lets get excited about DRM with bells and whistles removed Also  owned by the Chinese government Ingame music player Steam good Epic bad upvotes to the left Can this circlejerk get any worse Arent yalls dicks sore yet Jesus christ First off this meme jpg looks so bad you could almost submit it to rdeepfriedmemes Second they dont need a subscription because they are making money hand over fist because they have become this messiah for the PC community and everyone buys all their games through them Every video game released they get to see almost  of the revenue And then we get epic who is trying to establish itself on the PC and decided to fight the steam monstrosity with a few exclusives and you all throw a hissy fit because its not on Steam You are doing Valves job for them by worshiping them and buying everything on a single platform They stopped making games because they dont need to because you all wont buy your games somewhere else I fully expect downvotes but jesus this is the worst thing I have seen upvoted on this subreddit in a while Someone give me some lol consoles memes stat anything would be better than this If it launches games im good Its very rare that I ever leave the library page No ads Hmm Im pretty sure the featured games are ads but at least everything on there is game related No lip balm ads while Im browsing the store The year is the most important part imo One of the reasons I switched from console to PC when I was as  went from PS to a core i  desktop with a GTS  instead of getting a ps since I find it to be a complete scam to pay to play online rsteam is leaking The best part is that if your transaction fucks up during a sale steam saves your cart along with the discount applied for  hours Pretty fucking cool and you dont see anyone else doing it Microsoft and sony Exist That gonna be  we need from your bitch ass  of all sales a year Remmember that you dont actually own your games You forgot doesnt wholesale export your data to skeevy nd world countries Steam isnt a platform PC is Okay but they had all of this years ago Where is the drive passion and development Im glad Epic is creating their own store maybe itll light a fire under Valve And for anyone saying its free stop complaining Valve makes billions from Steam so while we arent paying a monthly fee were still paying for the platform in a way Its an estore you fucking knobs The only thing you could use as a plus in this kind of scenario is the mod support and community portions of steam which is just essentially forums Everything else is just ridiculous Free games No shit thats because the games are free to play thats not steam or valves doing No ads Its a store The whole thing is an ad Crazy sales Every store has sales Even the eeeevil Epic Store Unlimited downloads Are you shitting me Why wouldnt you have unlimited downloads Its just downloading shit The only limit is your internet provider and hard drive What even is multitasking supposed to mean here  dollars a year Because its just a store You arent charged a fee to enter target or walmart Like wtf I like steam and dislike epic but jesus you fanboys are sad This is like cheering for walmart Edit  and another thing Its not even just a store All this shit could be handled by a site Its a store AND an always on datacollecting piece of DRM Are we considering DRM a plus now No official customer support besides billing Takes a large  of sales from devs Fought tooth and nail in court to avoid giving refunds Promotes a monopoly and convinces their users thats a good thing Singlehandedly created the lootbox market allowed underage gambling Has no quality controlprevention cryptominers viruses and worms in game files Encourages DRM At least it isnt Epic hurrdurr s Can you people please think for yourself for once Steam isnt good for the community theyre anticonsumer and anticompetitive You dont have to settle for less Not saying things like Epic Uplay origin etc are the answer but dont pretend steam is perfect No ads I love Steam too but what do you think all those things you see when you open Steam are And the more like this stuff when you look up a game Steam is full of game ads Just because theyre relevant to your interests and mostly unobtrusive doesnt mean theyre not ads Times sure do change The first year or  after steam came out all people did was bitch about how much it sucked GOG is better mainly because it has no DRM bullshit and I can play multiple games at once I dont fucking need some bullshit to prevent me from playing games I bought at the same time People have more than  computer and friends and family they want to lend their shit to  Game streaming to multiple machines  Steam Link RIP I shouldve respected you  Steam Controller the controller I made fun of at first but is by far the best PC  overall controller other than PS and I wish I respected it when it was first released It was Steam that attracted consolers to PC Gaming Like Xbox and Playstation many consolers refer to PC Gaming simply as Steam as a third platform instead of the traditional PC Also the pioneers of Lootboxes and a built in exploitative Market Place where whales are charged hundreds of dollars for gun skins Steam gud Ea Bad Upvotes top left Ive been on pc my whole life bar a wii and an Xbox  and although they dont need to pay generally for online I dont think the wii was pay for online its much nicer to have a PC due to the games I have on the holy platform of gaben STEAM and the sales which I am a slave to Ingame internet browser  Dont forget dark mode by default monopoly If this is a monopoly i like it Press F to pay your respects Everyone always forget universal controller support For me this is the biggest benefit of Steam I just click a game and as long as its newer than  years old then it will work without issue with my controller I spend way more than  a year on in Steam i liked steam before big picture mode idk why Killing HalfLife  Priceless Dont forget about serious Linux support No ads You mean except all the ads for games Literally everything in steam is an ad though On the store page Not that Im complaining Dont forget the hentai games Unlimited downloads is sorta wrong as you only get  at a time but actual speed is superb on steam ALL HAIL LORD GABEN Then u find out its not  a year its  a week Uh why are people circle jerking over a store being free Obviously its free practically ever app store is free and they make money by taking a cut from developers Google Play and App Store are also  per year so Mobile Gaming Master Race I guess How do you find the courage to say something so bold Actually you need to spend  bucks to add friends and use some of the community features Bullshit You are paying  of the games price for those services If you think that publishers of the PC games do not account for those  when choosing games price  think again  of what you pay for a game actually Dont get me wrong this is my main platform and its awesome but great things are never free  server support for games  open source anticheat even if its bit a shit  Open source engine with regular updates for over  years  Open to cross platform play and rd party app integration  Allows developers to sell or give away the keys elsewhere at no benefit to steam with some conditions The difference between private and public companies The day Valve goes public guaranteed investors would draft up  ways to enter the assholes of all Steam users before the first day

citizens also help with this Im sure Im not the only one with this question Just seems strange to be calling American congress all the way from South Africa in my case This is the office of Nancy Pelosy the mailbox is full Figures EVERYONE needs to call their parents  grandparents as soon as they can and inform them what is going on The largest demographic these scumbags are manipulating and using to support their bullshit claims are the middleaged  eldery Therefor its imperative this demographic finds their voice in this fightCall them tonight or tomorrow morning inform them of the issue why its bad and why we need net neutrality and askbegbargain with them to call their representatives Theres a bunch of websites and whatnot that make it easier to contact these politicians find one that works for you and set it up for them This is what I will be doing in the morning I urge you all to do the same Think its a good idea Please share it in the many other threads about Net Neutrality Whem you do share this idea use this hashtag nananeutrality so I can track how many posts are mentioning it Share it with your friends and blackmail them with embarrassing stories that you STILL remember into contacting their representatives Is there anything that american citizens below the legal voting age can do What can us outside US do Other than watch greedy old men once again trying to kill internet freedom  the FCC wont let me be Or let me be me so let me see They try to shut me down on MTV Its ridiculous that every couple of months this keeps popping up again Do they really not get the message that everyone is pushing against it Luckily Im in the UK and as part of EU rules our ISPs are under strict Net Neutrality rules However once our dumb as all hell country ends up leaving the EU well probably be facing this idiocy ourselves Ill try and do what I can as a NonUS because I know I wouldnt want my government to treat our citizens like this Im afraid boyos httpspetitionswhitehousegovpetitiondonotrepealnetneutrality A petition sign this even for nonAmericans So if you havent already theres a bot you can text that helps you write an email or a fax free of charge to your senator or governor Text resist to  and itll ask you some questions then youre onto writing From another thread a few weeks ago someone posted this message and it think its a great one to send Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation free speech and democracy on the Internet Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology science small business and culture Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all Id love to credit the user but have lost the comment but please go send some faxes show your politicians you want net neutrality to stay  Share away Seriously only takes a few minutes of your time You can also find this Bot on Facebook Messenger ResistBot Such a sad state is upon us Just imagine watching p Porn Buffering because you didnt pay XYZ cable for XYZ plan to steal your data and put you in a fast lane This is actually becoming a real problem we need to stop this BTW I see a lot of circlejerk on this issue on Reddit I highly recommend that you read up on the arguments for and against it People tend to oversimplify but the Wikipedia articlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNetneutrality has detailed sections on the common arguments made Can someone enlighten me on the issues of removing the net neutrality regulations I get the core concept ISPs being able to choose what type of data to prioritize depending on the user or content as well as blocking certain webpages and services and having people pay more to access them But this is so obviously a dick move from everyones perspective and would probably lead to the users choosing a different ISP So why would ISPs do this when it so obviously leads to loosing their customers What is the real danger with the so called Open Internet Can i do something even if im a minor and not american httpwwwlegisworksorgcongresspublawpdf httpswwwgpogovfdsyspkgSTATUTEpdfSTATUTEPgpdf In the first link thats the Act from  and Relevant information is under Title II Keep in mind this was written in  so Im sure interpretations into Internet are wide and vague The second link is the Telecommunications Act of  and pertinent information is in Section  Ive really been searching hard to see the argument that NN has done anything good since being put into place and I cant find it so if you do Id be happy to hear about it Its essentially an emotional argument I would say that the internet has gotten substantially worse as a whole since  Since NN was put in place the local ISPs here have put data caps into place I think there is a severe misunderstanding by the majority of reddit as to what Net Neutrality really is It was our last chance last time I wonder if this will ever stop popping up every few months This wont be the last you hear of them even if you win Honestly the whole fucking FCC should just be abolished If this goes through and Congress does nothing or actively votes to remove Title II then our next effort should be to compile a list of these people in Congress and do everything to prevent their reelection Wait if the FCCs job is to regulate and they stop regulating this isnt that a violation of the FCCs whattheyaresupposedtoso Why is everyone freaking out net neutrality wasnt in place untill  and the internet was fine then Calm down people Guys i have bad news As you might have known the FCC is not listening to us anymore They say that we are all frauds here is the link httpswwwthevergecomfccnetneutralitycommentswerelargelyignored it seems like we must trust this to anonymous or the protests Does this mean we lost httpswwwthevergecomfccnetneutralitycommentswerelargelyignored I do feel sorry for people who have this problem From what Im aware of its not a huge issue here in AUS Could be wrong But i am playing my part and hope that this ends soon FreeTheInternet  posts on the frontpage This is the most succesful and simultaniously the most annoying shit ever from you muricans removed Where does Zuckerberg sit on this issue Its all fine and dandy for us to sit in our echo chamber of Reddit and rant about this until the cows come home but even as big as Reddit is we are still a limited crowd and the majority of the voter base isnt on here I feel like a day of protest by Facebook would do wonders Shut the site down for a day or give phony popups saying you havent purchased the social media package I just feel like the  demographic is somewhat better represented on FB Twitter and other social media than on Reddit and these companies should probably get involved here Or hell as much as I hate them has anyone designed a viral Facebook post related to this Get something with a clickbait title and have it display an image that says Im sorry you have not purchased the premium package necessary to view this post And have it link to battleforthenet or something Id gladly start posting something like that around And Im not really referring to something as simple as a picture alone What is that ISPs  Sorry Im dumb Im not an American citizen what can I do Thanks again for the reminder I just contacted all my repssenators and let them know not to vote to kill it and if they do I will vote against them next election My ISP is already DDOSsing me so my hope has been lost already even though this ruling has no effect on me Is there anything I can do if I dont live in the US Unite brethren On the bright side my reps call inbox is full so hes probably gotten plenty of calls Im glad that my country doesnt have this problem  wish you guys all the best in oppressing this law Netherlands these  peoplehttpswwwfccgovaboutleadership are the ones voting on the topic Make sure you email them and contact them We need to tell the two women who are for net neutrality that we support them and the other  that we are for it and against their beliefs Its a vote between FCC chairmen which is  republicans who are against net neutrality men and  who are for it women Make sure you are in contact with them JUST AS MUCH SAVE THE NET What would be the chances of something does happen that net neutrality will be put back into place HerehttpsappsfccgovedocspublicattachmatchFCCApdf is a link to the initial decision by the FCC The relevant info eg proposed changes starts on page  of the pdf Personally Id be fine with the upholding of the Bright Line Rules pg  while also recategorizing internet providers as Title I information services I do think it is important to prevent ISPs from restricting access to third party applications through paid prioritization or outright blocking but Im not entirely sure that the FCCs rollback of the Title II Order wont already cover these bases as there is already legal and regulatory precedent against these practices including the FCCs  Open Internet Order pg  I wont be surprised if the repeal goes through but Im not at all sure that it will be as devastating to our internet usage as we all believe it will be I just left  messages i hope everyone does the same  Net neutrality could use a few tweaks to it though IORC when the law first passed it killed deals that Sprint a cellular carrier was offering They had plans that offered unlimited dat for certain apps Netflix Spotify and YouTube and made it abundantly clear that there was throttling going on to make it possible Unfortunately these plans got killed by the net neutrality law I see no problem with situations like this where you have the choice to opt in for slower speeds and more data I am not an American citizen but if you are then please make calls and make it clear you do not accept this I hope everyone realizes that this issue isnt only going to affect the web it will also affect online games If this law passes then I guess you cant use the Online gaming is free on PC excuse anymore ISPs dare to want to charge extra for use of high bandwidth websitesapps Redditers WTF STOP THE CORPORATIONS Twitter tracks your browsing history and bans you for visiting sites controversial political consultants tell them are bad Redditers oh well its a free country I entered my number ready to read the prepared script to my local rep the Honorable Peter Roskam when I got greeted with an automated message that said Honorable Peter Roskam is not taking calls at this time click click The Honorable Peter Roskams Voice mail box is full and you cannot leave a new message at this time Please wait on the line to dial a different number Im not sure what to do in Wyoming Ive written my reps but Enzi R and Barrasso R have shown theyll vote party lines on absolutely everything basically doing the Ill keep your thoughts in mind as I totally fucking ignore it thing I really dont think any of this will work A billion phone calls arent as valuable as a billion dollars It pisses me off so much Tried calling but they wont answer and the voice mailbox is full I think my side of town did their job That Ajit Pai guy is probably just salty that theres no net neutrality in his country OK if net neutrality is repealed the internet will go the way of the consoles online service It will suck and even though the corporations dont NEED us to pay them they will still make us because they can Whats the point of buying anything for our PCs or anything that has to do with the Internet when we know Ashit Pai and all the ISPs are going to jack up our Internet bills I was thinking of buying a new lap top but if this asshole gets his way whats the point No thanks Thank god Australia doesnt even have proper internet anyway for this to effect us Internet Highways and payed packages will cause every Australian server to spontaneously combust Hue What can people from other countries do to help If I lived in the us I would have called them Last chance for this round If the government somehow loses this round theyll be back to try again Its a never ending cycle until we get the fucking Republicans out of office Quick question theres  ISPs on the website if net neutrality fails wouldnt people flock towards companies that wouldnt fuck your shit up I just completed the calls and wanted to report that it only took about  minutes Take  minutes make the calls and help out Your upvotes dont matter without some real action Everything was literally fine and none of those ifs and coulds happened before NN was implemented a couple of years ago Does any of this affect people outside of the US Im mad for you guys but Id like some insight as to how far this spreads Something doesnt smell right First false information in a formula these big companies support net neutrality so its bad then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN httpswwwopensecretsorgnewsissuesnetneutrality VERIZON ATT COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN There is a reason You need to dig deeper to understand They arent trying to stop censorship They are censorship They already censor all over the web They already censor media from trending on social media They tell us some links are fake news Hell they censor us on this website right now The hypocrisy is overwhelming The censorship is here What people dont get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN Its real simple They will selectively enforce They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse Dont give me some bs link about some isp in Canada Also all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections Right now we need to get rid of the title  regulations so people can get more service provider options Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch There is an end game here It is not just what you see right now on the front page Remove NN remove title  allow more ISPs to compete if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic That is the real plan not reddits bullshit And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say its better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office We arent going to let them control everything Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN Can you bypass all the ISP issues by using VPN Only in America wish I could do my part I have a question how can people outside the USA help Because I think that calling to the US gov to start a discussion about this subject is not so effective if you call from outside the US The Netherlands as example Or is it effective to call from outside the US Why the fuck are you guys always fighting the fcc Instead of getting signatures to stop one bill get signatures to kick those Fucks out Every month you take over reddit because everyone does the bare minimum As European citizen I will take my risk by not giving a fuck about US and their laws Thank you and have a good day STOPSPAM Im getting tired of writing this so Im just gonna copypasta it from my previous post This entire thing is a very clever play by Google and Netflix to get consumers into pushing their agenda Back in the early s public Internet backbone was beginning to get crowded In response to this ATT and Comcast constructed their own privately held backbone for which they planned to charge companies who chose to use it a premium Very similar to a toll road in fact Google and Netflix two massive users of bandwidth wanted to increase their speeds They also did not want to pay Comcast or ATT for the privilege of such So they lobbied the government and implemented something called net neutrality regulations forcing the telecoms to offer equal access to their private networks for free Then they convinced America that what they had done was to protect consumers Nobody in this story is a good guy Everyone is greedy Pick the best side dont be a pawn in these corporate wars Obviously its more likely than not a little late to convince most of you as youve already chosen a side But not thinking net neutrality is a good thing doesnt mean you cant still dislike ATT and Comcast For different reasons Im of the mind that most of the large Telecom companies need to be broken up under antitrust laws Net Neutrality however is not the cureall you believe it to be deleted You can also email your Congressional representativeshttpsactefforgactioncongressdontselltheinternetout using the EFFs Take Action tool httpsyoutubesIzNtstt There is a petition out there that supports Net Neutrality please consider signing it if you are an Americanhttpspetitionswhitehousegovpetitiondonotrepealnetneutrality Im Canadian Will this effect me If you dont live in USA will this still count Im canadian How would this affect me if they repeal net neutrality and can I help through this Those it help to sign even if Im not from the US Hey people Sign this petition httpspetitionswhitehousegovpetitiondonotrepealnetneutrality Like everyone in this thread I  support net neutrality HoweverI cant help but feel sceptical and saddened that this vote will be passed regardless of how much activism we the public engage in It just seems that large corporate interests have a much greater impact on government decisions than us citizens collectively do We have seen this time and time again with the growth of the military and prison industrial complexes and more recently with the halfmeasures put out during the Obama administration to get more people enrolled in health insurance coverage I just think that all this activism wont change what is already a forgone conclusion and well be subject to the whim of corporate greed for many years to come Its getting vetoed the millisecond it hits Trumps desk Too little too late Thanks for playing This is your last chance to not be a retard campaigning for shit you dont understand Government fucked up the ISP market and now your solution is more govenrment Get real this bullshit mindjob still going about I remember when muh Net Neutrality was called SOPA and eveyone stood against it I am opposed to Net Neutrality I have a subreddit rNoNetNeutrality If youre sick of people blindly pushing to give the state more control over the internet join us please Thank you From what Ive seen this is primarily about retaining title II rights in keeping Internet Access a utility that cannot be limited at will I genuinely want to know why this is necessary and if you can please give me any instance before Title II rights were given in  that required this law to be passed One question here Why is it a bad thing to prioritize packets to high volumewidely used services Youre saying you want packet transfer to the daily stormer to be the same as netflix NN is a lie there is a bigger picture we dont yet see going on here As non US citizen I find it funny how Battlefront  gets x more attention than net neutrality Only dumb fucking liberals would take the internet that has flourished without any Net Neutrality shit and then demand the government take over how it should work for some pretend scenarios Just like Global warming but its the net HOLY SHIT STOP SPREADING LIES

were really that easy dont you think they would have fixed it by now s The technology just isnt there yet Do you think they employ the level of expertise that you have I can tell by your ability to hack their websites HTML that you have at least  PhDs in Theoretical Computation That comes at a high price one that Valve cannot afford You are clearly engaged in the most deplorable witchcraft sir Repent thyself before it is too late Thing is this wasnt even a problem before the sale So for some reason they didnt just copypaste the search bar code they have normally for the sales search Valve isnt making games and doesnt bugfix Steam What are they even doing Theyll fix it in Steam  I pointed this out yesterday and got no points  httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracecommentsiyddfixthesearchbarsteamdjacoipcontext the technology isnt quite there yet  valve dev Looks like they fixed it Just went on steam and they actually fixed it good shit OP VAC Banned Gaben has listenedhttpiimgurcomnyMennDpng Its a feature Looks like they did just thathttpsiimgurcomYdOBSIjpng yall can stop circlejerking already Its in queue to fix Its sitting right behind HL  gets banned for cheating Valve fixes things by adding hats s Holy shit I was just thinking how stupid that was And how a major gaming application cant figure out how to clear the search bar lol So glad this thread exists haha Are you the hacker chan Top  things steam doesnt want you to know number  will shock you Seems its fixed now We did it Reddit False They are using Value and javascript for it to be able to work on older versions of Internet Explorer Your fix only works for new versions of browsers The problem that is happening right now is that the JS is not loading properly I think the bigger question is why the text is greyblack on a darkish blue and almost impossible to read They fixed it Heres why its not fixed I read this about Microsoft Once Its a  minute fix for dev which Turns into a  minute job for his Immediate Manager to Approve which turns into a  min line item in a meeting which then takes a Week to Approve which then takes another week to get back to the Dev another Week for QA and Language People to look at it etc etc Im paraphasing but you get what I mean  EditKinda curious why downvotes big companies work like this Why do you disagree I love it when programmers open up the code in their browser and point out these  second fixes I dont have the problem everyone else is having The search bar has always been fine for me deleted Theyve fixed it I think theyre among us reading whatever we write stalker They seem to have fixed it Likely a developer in Valve knows about this and know how to fix it But he faced a wall of blockers this needs QA business approval marketing legal and deal with the deployment of the fix The developer also needs to convince other developers that the solution is good deal with the ego of the team that owns the search bar because they didnt implement the stupid solution in months or years and additionally he needs to put his own time to do all of this because the company is busy in other important projects If youre wondering why the owners of the search bar dont fix the problem its because they are busy doing other stuff When you as a developer face all these challenges to make simple change you simply give up Goddamn Valve is incompetent AF I guess nobody felt like working on this and there are no bosses so nothing gets done If I may suggest a lazier workaroundhttpiimgurcomtJEWqogifv

will destroy you for Love Reddit Man you should be going to MIT or something Thats illegal Youre not allowed to embarrass teh Gaben with these easy fixes These are hard to deal with issues that will require many Steam sales to solve unrelated so please dont up vote but what software did you use to record this Hire him Valve I am actually doing webdev on a project right now and I never have before and this post helped me with something Ive struggled to figure out Thank you          Half Life  confirmed Im still curious why they dont hire some of you guys The lot of you know how to do this stuff better than they do For real though its not that hard I dont understand why they felt compelled to force it to have a default value instead of just a simple placeholder Then again it could be for maximum compatibility with older browsers As a front end web developer this hurts my heart Wheres the polyfill for IE Wheres the graceful degradation Im sorry but this would require at least  hours of dev time plus  rounds of revisions and review Searchbargate Placeholder doesnt work on IE and IE has a few issues especially with international letters I believe Steam uses IE under the hood by default on Windows They could use a shim or something but thats more JS to be loaded on every page So Valve may well be lazy but it could also be they know their demographics  have tested this and have decided it isnt worth it They clearly have designers actively working there I cant imagine they dont know about the placeholder attribute Id probably give them the benefit of the doubt but then again sometimes things just slip under the radar Until it blows up on reddit Im sorry I dont really understand Whats wrong with the steam search bar and what did the guy do in the gif to fix it Ever wonder how EASY is it to fix Steams search bar issue FTFY Fixes a coding issue mixes up it is for is it in the title Mine already does that anyway In fact Ive never had a problem like this strange i dont have that problem I never had the issue I dont have it right now Dude they fixed it Someone ELI What was the search bar issue deleted But thats how it worked for months now lol Its fixed What about the horrendous metacritic search bar what sorcery is this Did they just fix it I went in to test and it already said placeholder and it actually replaced as I typed seems like they fixed ithttpiimgurcomwHkGFnpng just went to look and the code was changed to placeholder they fixed it deleted Thank you Reading some of the comments in the other thread about how hard it would be and that you need javascripts to do it was killing me What is the issue with the search bar in the first place Submit that PR already  of the bugs with steam I could fix in minutes each For real May I ask what the problem was I thought I was the only one nice can you do HL next plz Now make a post titled Ever wonder how hard it is to make Half Life  deleted  What is thishttpspastebincomFcrFsk Please do a post like this but for VAC Hopefully they will fix that too Learn about us and our historyhttpspcmasterraceorghistory PCMR isnt just a subreddit but a very large community founded in  that is ALSO on

packs Like youd get a full game and then sometime later theyd release a whole other minicampaign with new levelsweaponswhatever for  bucks or so That was cool Edit Jesus Christ I didnt anticipate this many replies I guess there are still good expansion packs as many have kindly pointed out Back to rcfb with me See where he went wrong was when he said Meh okay Im not sure when it happened but at some point I started waiting around  years to buyplay a game No matter how good it is there is a finite amount of time Ill spend playing it Its much more satisfying to play Civ Fallout Elder Scrolls etc for the very first time after all expansions have been released and the really good mods have been released Or take the Ubisoft approach Buy the full game for  OR buy the full full game for about  Ark Consumerism DeEvolved See but actually its a brilliant way of doing things Its just not a consumer friendly way This is why I was weary about buying pubg plus all the current negative comments on steam Mostly due to the devs not doing what they said from reading reviews A bunch of my gamer friends got it early though and basically peer pressure and I caved Not like Im going to buy lootboxes or shit but who knows what they might try to make you pay for when the game is finally ready Remember when TF was not free Its the same style of vegansidekick so pcmasterracesidekick Member when games were sold completely finished Isnt this just vegan sidekick with different words Every single internet comic everhttpsimgurcomaGwdm Elite Dangerous would like a word All these posts yet people will still buy this crap Nice this is my favorite gaming circlejerk Please allow me to accelerate the progress Yeah but developers will continue to do it because you people continue to buy early access and season passes Yes but that doesnt make it any less shitty of a practice At this point theres basically a redundant back and forth about how gamers need to stop caving to these sales practices and how developers are shitty for engaging in these sales practices Sprinkle in some random side drama about a popular game some over the top toxic aggression and boom youve got yourself a classic comment chain Seems to be inspired by Hitman  Holy shit Im dealing with the last panel right now over in Nintendo Except its about the new Animal Crossing mobile game with the extremely abundant microtransactions and FP gambling tactics Keep in mind I love Nintendo games I carry a DS almost every day and the only game I play is Animal Crossing New Leaf aside from a few virtual console games of course But visiting that subreddit or any Nintendo community Wow They know when Nintendo is doing something wrong eg preying on addictive personalities for their mobile games and amiibos how they rarely innovate in their games etc but they utterly love it Its like Nintendo fanboys are the gaming equivalent of the BDSM scene They know theyre getting hurt they know most people see it as wrong but they love how Nintendo treats them Should be another square where they decide to use the money they got to start another game They promise to finish the other one eventually Well maybe Halo Wars  still salty that the last DLC wasnt included in the Ultimate Edition Vote with you wallet Only buy games that you enjoy Except dont preorder Also only buy DLC that meets a specific litmus test for being worth it If they offer preorder incentives dont even buy it after release Even if its a game you would enjoy dont buy it if the publisher cancels some unrelated game they hired a different studio to make If you have some specific point to make about a game then make it These generalized calls for outrage are getting tiresome Only dlc Ill support would be borderlands  or Witcher  type dlcs Early access is basically a glorified kickstarter now Let me tell you what Ive learned from a career as a lawyer giving people money for the promise of future work is the best way to guarantee they fuck you over Humans cant help it Deep down we are all selfish assholes looking out for  Giving trust before it is earned makes you an idiot and a sucker not a good person In criminal defense law the defendant has to pay the lawyer  money up front Then you have to hope and pray that he does a good job because he already has all your money and has no incentive whatsoever to work hard for you In my own cases when clients dont pay me anything upfront they tend to be a huge pain in the ass to work with They havent invested anything and so they are absolute cunts and will absolutely cut and run and backstab me the moment they feel it suits their interests Ive had clients bamboozle me hard core to get me to do free work for them when they knew it was all based on lies just so I would delay the inevitable for them so they could keep making illgotten gains for as long as possible These cases were semicontingent based on loser pays contracts The con was giving me false info so they looked like slam dunk winners so Id take their case without getting paid when the reality was they were  in the wrong In addition every single time I have won a case for a private party they never paid me a dime afterward whether they owed me k or  Their attitude is they dont need you anymore so go fuck yourself One time a year later I had a client come back out of nowhere and offer to pay me Guess why They needed me on a new case Thats the ONLY reason I got paid I have learned that clients with good credit scores  tend to be reliable and will do what they say Clients with bad scores under  will knife you in the back every time and give no fucks Paying a video game developer is a great way to get fucked over This is especially true when the developer is a small indie and is trying to monetize an unfinished game For all you know they are sick of the game and are trying to cash out for whatever they can get by blowing a bunch of false promises up your ass I have seen a few truly good early access games get fleshed out a lot with plenty of extra work put in after Subnautica comes to mind but for every  game where it works youve got  games where the developers got what cash they could and then either  the cash was too low and they basically considered the game a failure and abandoned it no refunds  the cash was too high and they got spoiled and stopped giving any fucks LOOKING AT YOU NOTCH  the cash was alright but the developer decided this cash pays for development SO FAR ie the unfinished piece of shit and all new development is going to get a shiny new price tag because otherwise the developers feel like theyre working for free Ark Venture capitalism and loans are superior Yes some games wont ever be released but VC firms are better equipped to hold developers accountable and force them to work Developers cant con VC firms as easily with false promises like they can with consumers This type of stuff has really made me lose my interest in gaming overall Im extremely picky now and usually wait a few months even Im hyped  you can only get burned on preorders so many times before youre just a sucker No Mans Sky really broke me of looking forward to games Reddit has ruined the word entitled for me Apparently having standards or expectations is now considered being a entitled asshole  Video games nowdays becamebuy to pay Meanwhile Squad If you bought Kerbal Space Program prior to  the DLC is free TakeTwo Entertainment Why are my ears bleeding Relitedangerous thats exactly how State of decay scammed me I bought the game and DLC long time ago  httpstoresteampoweredcomappStateofDecay And now there is a new version of the game with DLC  HD option  bug fix httpstoresteampoweredcomappStateofDecayYOSE AND I NEED TO PAY  TO PLAY IT   greedy devellopers Since when do you need to pay to have a game with bug fixed The same artist also does the Vegan Sidekick series of comics People in the comment section Yeah people who buy early access games are dumb Also same people in comment section Buys early access game It sucks that reddit is riddled with these idiots defending shady developers The thing is theres a middle ground Essentially if you look at the product you get to make the determination whether its worth it to you or not For some people its worth it to preorder a game and pay the sticker price I did that for GTA V when it was released and I dont regret it one bit GTA V was one of the most fun games Ive ever played removed Ive stuck pretty hard to my no early access thing Im really surprised that most others dont seem to care The problem Im having now though people are just labeling finished games early access so they can be lazy about issues There are also games that just permanently stay early access Ark even released paid dlc during early access which is beyond unacceptable imo The fanboy drawing is perfect Evolve I can somewhat understand this concept if its for an actual episodic title like Telltale games But its absurd that devs do it for linear nonepisodic titles Ive found that if I get involved in a late alpha or beta game that I am bored to tears with it by the time it is complete and released to the general public Additional content doesnt usually help either Dont tell me how to spend my money Gawd Im an adult I do what I want Ugh Just went through essentially this about Bethesda charging full price for the VR version of Fallout Everyone defending them for releasing the same game again Stop buying games Do not discount the possibility that the fan boy is part of a paid marketing effort by EA to mislead consumers People have an evolutionary need to feel like they belong  when they know that there are others who engage in a behavior they will do the same thing more comfortably rstarwarsbattlefront in a nut shell The fan boy needs fire coming out his mouth I think were getting to the point where the Game of the Year edition doesnt even include everything I prefer Doki Doki Literature clubs model Game is free then theres a single  dlc for the soundtrack Not that it would work for every game but damn I actually bought their DLC just to support the developers  I think its the only time Ive ever bought DLC Just wait until micro transactions are a thing when you payperminute of gameplay The fanboy should be dragged into a courtyard and shot so anyone who defends Overwatch loot boxes and anyone who defended ARK selling DLC in early access The gaming world needs a good shake up Sigh I miss buying completed games when my friends and I had all the same content I quit Eve Online because of something like this I paid for an Explorer Pack only to have it contain a link to paid content I paid for the privilege of paying even more Holy shit Just like my inbox earlier Commented about the mobile Animal Crossing having microtransactions and I get called entitled No youre just fucking brainwashed into thinking that should be the norm TripleA and fan communities in general in a nutshellSpecifically EA and Paradox Vegan master race I havent preordered a game in almost  years and havent felt the slightest bit of regret for it I do not understand the appeal Destiny While I generally agree with the intent of this comic can we please stop this same stock portrayal Lets see  main character is completely rational and coolheaded in all circumstances even aloof what a cool guy  corporate dude is charming at first then aggressive and uncaring once theyve turned on you as they planned all along because theyre sneaky and conniving  dissenting voice is portrayed as a shrill mental deficient and what theyre saying is irrelevant  all that matters is that its shrieked at the main character who remains aloof  details of the season pass are not discussed and it is implied that the main character thinks he is buying all future updates to any form of the game regardless of whether or not said season pass explicitly declares as such Its such a strawman its kind of cringey Bought hitman after they finished all missions Now there is more missions and will cost money Will wait for a huge discount Learn about us and our

laughing at the meme FTFY instead of Firefox Quantum holy mother of upvotes a Rita Repulsa meme relevant to my current hobbies Edge actually isnt bad It gets p on Netflix and is quite snappy There are a  things keeping me with Chrome the extensions and my general resistance to change I didnt think I would ever use another browser after Firefox but then Chrome came along I am not saying I will switch to Edge but perhaps another browser Googles reach is getting a bit too much I need to export my passwords to a password manager and attempt to stop Google facebook and even reddit tracking me I use Firefox as my main browser plus Edge and Opera for compatibility testing and separating tabs into different windows yeah I know I could just have multiple Firefox windows The only browser I absolutely dont open unless I have to is Chrome I just need to open Explorer to download Chrome I read this in her voice and now my throat hurts even though I only read it in my head removed This is how it appears to me when I accidentally open Chrome instead of Firefox Ten thousaaaand yeeears will give you such a crick in the neck U mean when u accidently install chrome amd open it instead of firefox Then it asks you to set it as the default using chrome in  LUL You misspelled Firefox as chrome Feel like they shouldve removed explorer instead of paint This fucking thread I just spent half an hour on the Power Rangers wiki OP you fucker Chrome Lol Real people use Firefox The the is what ruins the joke Its simply Earth not The Earth This isnt a picture this is a gif of Explorer taking

Microsoft Edge after a system restore Been working perfectly fine for me Dont see any reason to grab Chrome again at this point Fuck Chrome FF is just as fast has better Dev tool features including CSS grids is less of a resource hog better keyboard shortcuts Laughed to hard at this Or if you are using Sky Go in the UK Im reminded of that hell mouth imp webcomic internet exploder I work with some older guys  and they always use internet explorer and when I get on their computer Im like wtf is this For real though does anyone have any good recommendations for a low resource browser that performs reasonably I cant even use Chrome with our old office computers Its slower than IE Then you proceed to spam click X as fast as possible because you cant even tolerate seeing it Open in default browser Oh shit I forgot to set chrome as that Knock knock Its task manager Not IE but I actually do use Edge almost daily But only for Netflix I really dislike the App as Chrome doesnt go higher than p with Netflix Ten thousand yeaaaaars will give you SUCH a CRICK in the NECK Why do I remember her sounding like an evil Roseanne Theres no chance Roseanne played her right  years is how long it takes to open MAKE MY ADVERTS GRROOOOW Chrome Chrome is the new ie You mean instead of Firefox Firefox Edge is my default browser Even on Android deleted IE is so slow to load I knew I clicked the wrong one before it even launches ITT Firefox shills Edge is it not these days  I have gotten more malware from Chrome than Edge Opera and FireFox both have better security Operas built in VPN and the beta version of FireFoxs DNS masking are more advanced than anything Chrome or Edge have Firefox Chrome Really I use Firefox and Opera I just installed Java today and when it went to open a browser to test if it installed correctly it opened IE It must of been so excited to finally get some use I promptly closed it of course i recently installed windows to a new ssd and edge kept freezing whenever i visited the firefox website im not even sure if its intentional or not Or click anything other than Firefox  When Windows intentionally opens Internet Explorer FTFY When you accidently open IE instead of ChromeFirefox deleted People give IE a bunch of crap but its the best Firefox downloader Ive ever used At last its time to enable recommended security and compatibility settings Just give it  years to load So good LMFAO this is amazing I havent crunched the numbers but most of the time when you see iE on someones desktop its their porn folder with the icon changed I always sit there puzzled why chrome would ask me if I wanted to use recommended settings Ive been using Opera for years occasionally Firefox too when I have too but Opera has always been the innovator they invented pretty much all the modern browser functionality and Ive never had a problem with the desktop version the mobile one is shit though Internet Explorer Rita Repulsa Google Chrome Zordon Firefox Astronema Alpha Internet Explorer has escaped Assemble a team of browsers with ad blockers I feel like this When Edge is opened There are some who exclusively use Opera Brothers join together

and it hasnt been a problem since Slow down IE its just oh Loading I was using a hz monitor until last week but now I have a hz one and oh boy oh boy do I feel the difference they werent lying The worst is going from a hz to a PlayStation exclusive locked at fps Its actually painful Lol know the feeling My personal desktop and my work computer run through the same hz x monitor My computer  hz no worries Work computer   Did anyone here ever switch to a hzhz monitor while keeping one hz monitor and if so is it jarring to look at when its side by side  im making the move up to hz this black friday and im a little scared ive played rocket league for over  years now and have honed my skillsx around hz im terrified that all my muscle memory is going to be thrown off by the silky smooth Too poor to try  Exactly my problem I got a hz p monitor and i wanne upgrade to a p or a k monitor but i dont wanna loose my fps i have this feeling every time i go to work Roblox is locked to  fps feelsbadmanpng This is the only reason I havent upgraded to high refresh rate will it really ruin me for all other screens When I got my hz a few weeks ago I had trouble noticing at first it was only until I went back to hz and THEN went back to hz I noticed how different it was unpopular opinion hz is nice  definitely better but I have no problems at all with using a hz monitor As someone who has only ever known hz when I get financially stable enough for my next upgrade I cant wait Is this some sort of rich people joke on  broke to understand My friend has a hz I went to his house once and played on it Mmmhhhh  hz gang been using a hz for  years now Next Week im getting a hz one cant wait to feel the difference Currently stuck on a hz until any of these new p hz IPS monitors drop in the next few months Never experienced anything over hz before so should be in for a treat hz gang My friend with more money than brains has an ik and GYX  upgraded to p fps on an ultra wide monitor He mostly plays Warframe and Overwatch I didnt even notice a difference moving from p to p homie should have gone hz Me exactly I was told to have a look at that and I agree everyone should have a look at that Dont tell me this my bank account cant handle it I game almost exclusively on TV so Im limited to  until I upgrade next year But even  seems very smooth coming from consoles One day Ill get a hz monitorone day I have a hz monitor and been using it for awhile I wanted to ry k on my k tv so i hooked it up hz Nope i will go back to p at  There was a video about a guy who said dont buy a hz monitor because the majority of screens use hz and once you get a hz monitor you cant go back to hz One of the reasons why Ill never buy a hz monitor I got a whole new PC a week ago and the RTX Ti SLI i K is a huge improvement from my GT M i GHz laptop Hz feels so smooth You cant see more that fps s haha i feel y no i dont i have never have hz monitor in my life Used hz its amazing Now I have to use my hz monitor I want to die My phone has a hz display and my PC monitor runs at hz  FPS feels slow af now My laptop is  and my desktop is  and i frequently forget cause I dont notice the difference anymore I would like to take this opportunity and press F for all those who forget to change refresh rate from hz in Novideo control panel a few years ago Kinda poor my entire life of a PC gamer I been having a hz monitor I cannot understand the meme i just visited one dude he had some high end p gsync monitor and was on hz and g off tell me why Is this a joke Im too broke to understand Ive only ever had a   I hope they will still sell  Hz monitors in the future though I get very sick from looking at  hz a type of motion sick I guess so Ive always loved  hz it doesnt make me feel sick Is this some sort of peasant thing i dont understand Ive got a K hz monitor and no space for a p hz but even after playing on a friends hz I like my high res games more Even something like RS looks absolutely stunning in K Ultra FPS I wouldnt swap I got a hz monitor about  weeks ago and you guys are a bunch of liars I honestly cant see the difference Been able to relate since yesterday laughs in console Cries in hz My fiance and I co op borderlands on xbox Split screen gives me headaches fps in a strange ratio This is new Just got a hz laptop after having double  hz desktop I think Ill be saving up for new monitors for my desktop lol Ive used  hz enough to know how amazingly smooth it is but not enough to be spoiled by it yet I cant imagine whats gonna happen once I build my new rig uMAXOHNO V C Cz You god damn right I played on my hz laptop for a year then came back and realized i couldnt plug it into my hz monitor without going back to hz It only has HDMI x and a displey port Honestly didnt feel it much Its even worse when you have a high refresh monitor but the game is capped to fps I have two screens My main one is Hz but my secondary one is Hz It feels so weird when I do stuff on my second screen I play on a hz and my mom is playing Spyro Remastered on Switch which runs at fps She keeps asking me to do boss fightshard flying levels for her and my brain hurts after My DP cable died on me back in april Used HDMI since Ill get that mind blowing experience again Its honestly really bad for the first  days you can notice it in seconds even the desktop iam never going back I played overwatch a while ago and my settings automatically changed when I installed my new gpu In overwatch you have to set the resolution and refresh rate but it got automatically set to  for some reason and oh boy was I confused why the game looked and felt so awful to play Me everyday I go to work  When u have a pc that can only run shit quality games but u play high quality games on lowest settings with fps max I need a new pc hz is laggy af to me I had to send mine in for an RMA Sucks to only have to use hz Im sure many people are going thru shitty fps right now when playing bl at K Wouldnt know the luxury only got a hz Is it really that much of a difference Dam hz monitor pleb Anything below fps on my hz monitor fucks with my head and is unplayable at that point I make this switch between my monitor and big screen often I honestly barely notice This is the one reason I will never go to hz  looks buttery smooth and Id rather not have to upgrade my pc to get hz on all my games once I get used to it My second monitor Hz what is my purpose Me you display discord Currently dying right now because I had to RMA my p hz monitor Going to go for the dell sdgf when I get the refund but until then Im stuck with a really old p tv Edit for anyone out there considering Aorus brand stuff stay the fuck away from it the  things I got from them are complete garbage monitor mainly Man I purposely never use  hz I dont want that kind of power I always feel like im doing something wrong because ive got a hz right beside a hz and can barely tell the difference Ive made sure the monitor and drivers are set correctly so maybe its just my eyes It makes me so sick after almost  years of hz Some time ago I was running dual monitors but I was mid upgrade So one was a hz panel the other hz Using  felt like it wasnt as smooth or fluid but it didnt seem that bad However when I began using them side by side multi tasking What a night and day difference The hz panel felt like it as so choppy and it just looked so unappealing visually It was the only way to get k  You guys praise this all the time but how can I see this in person Ask someone at micro center maybe I recently rented a flat that has an old bang  olufsen CRT TVVHS unit in it  one of the super expensive ones from the late s Its a gorgeous unit which is why I left it out but in a moment of perversity I decided to hook it up to a Chromecast No its from  it does not have HDMI Oh My God how did we ever look at things with these refresh rates AND THE SCANLINES its like everything looks like a  bit console again Technically its i in NTSC mode so hz for the full screen intermittent lines or Hz in PAL which is what I run it in But none of it is good Im running  monitors which have hz and hz Everytime I do something on my nd I frel the lag Painful Cant wait to buy one sweet  Hz monitor next month Ive been playing halo reach on an Xbox  The drop from  FPS with my capable of htz monitor down to  at best on a tv is painful At least its a bi tv right yea i recently build budget pc for my parents and it felt weird when tried some games at  fps and  hz old display I done this with destiny  locked it at fps and added motion blur and used a controller until I forgot it was  frames then reverting to no motion blur and  frames with MK and I just melted at the sight Pictures you can feel I have a  Hz monitor It feels weird since most media is   fps but it does have a slight improvement over  Hz Never seen a monitor above Hz Is this a rich joke Im too poor to understand When you go home from college My eyes hurt when I switch from my hz monitor to my hz laptop display Playing Spyro Reignited Trilogy right now and it runs great at  but some physics are tied to frame rate so you have to lock it down to  or  to complete some big jumps and its just awful Once you get hz theres no going back I kinda have to use a high refresh phone now cause throughout my  last years of high school i use an iPad Pro with a hz display and god damn is really really good my next computer is prolly gonna be a gaming laptop with a hz panel for the sake of overkill lmao but you dont need more than  This is how i feel whenever i try to game on my laptop Same frames shitty hz display laughs in hz I go from  to  its not that bad Try going from hz to hz it feels like youre playing on  ping Whenever i watch my brother play apex on the xbox while im on the  hz pc behind him everytime i look at his screen i swear my brain bleeds My pals still have hz after ive been on and on at them about how good hz is Now i just ask them whenever i see their monitors man how do you manage the headaches A poor person tv Source meme anyone This is what I fear if I jump to a hz smartphone i sadly cannot afford hz ive tried it and hz and i said wow out loud Had p  hz monitor and changed it to k hz and the difference in smoothness is not that visible but the difference in sharpness is huge imo Wouldnt go back for sure I have a  hz moniter and I can OC it to  hz I was thinking my pc was dying whenever I went back to  Going on movies after high hz monitor Hey I can see all the frames    Me at home vs me F At work sometimes I just go back to my gaming laptop every now and then to experienc hz again I have to use a hz monitor in work and its painful  Any PC gamers that have an office job go through this suffering from  for  days of the week Bruh I remember when fps looked amazing now that Im used to  when it drops down to s it looks gross only  lol Bbut the human eye can only see  fps I cant wait to go  or Hz I recently ascended to the PCMR and every now and then Ill cap the frames at  to remind myself of how nice my low budget PC actually is Even going down to  from my monitors Hz cap is unpleasant no joke Why would you come back to a hz monitor if you have a hz monitor This makes me wanna upgrade everything Ive got but I really shouldnt  Bro I went from playing battlefield v fps on my hz monitor to playing Borderlands  SPLITSCREEN with my cousin on my PS I thought I was going to throw up I just got a hz monitor with Gsync since it was on sale and my god does it give me a headache with certain applications Im not sure if its meant to do this but it will rapidly and randomly cycle through different refresh rates between hz needless to say after a short while it gets annoying Looking at my hz monitor compared to my moms hz monitor is like night and day Like staring at a piece of cardboard Cant wait to upgrade to  Its kinda like returning to xbox to tell you friends your not dead and seeing the atrociously that is the fps xbox Yo did you get this idea from that askreddit yesterday Dude said cinnamon toast fuck in the comments and Im pretty happy to see this so yeah good stuff Whats a   iMac Still havent seen a hz monitor Idk if thats a boon or a curse I run my old VGQE at hz strobed I never want to play games any other way Edit hz is good too but the strobing effect is what really makes a difference imo Edit Thishttpswwwblurbusterscomfaqhzmonitors is a great site for detailed info about blur reduction and here is their list of gaming monitors with high refresh rates hz gang This is why I dont plan on getting a super high frame rate monitor I dont really notice anything when looking at Hz after looking at Hz but I know Ill notice  after  Im keeping my tastes cheap I still dont even get  FPS on p one day Ill have enough money to understand Thatd be a good idea if I hadnt already tried that and have the same issue I just think I shouldnt have bought the ASUS VGQR Cries in  hz Can someone eli me about why a higher hz monitor is better Thank you for this  Who the H E double FUCK are you Anyone got experience with cheaper AOC p hz monitors I just bought a hz display last week and the second I tried doom on it I fell in love Tried to play it on my old hz display after that just for shits and giggles and I wasnt able to play for more than a couple of seconds such a major difference When I got my computer I got a hz ultrawide I absolutely fucking love it But now I see a lot of people make this same post You notice a huge difference when you revert back I guess ima get a second monitor regular wide with high hz lol Guys I just upgraded from a p TV to a  hz monitor Id been playing on that for the last  years with a  and wow what was I thinking Its revolutionary I was in my local computer store where they had a working hz on display I cant go back to hz When I overclocked my hz monitor to  and it became shittier Idk why I am pc noob My laptop has a hz screen but my main PC used hz even Windows feels slow I have k hz monitor shitty PC and Im playing on p hz And I have never experienced hz yes we exist Thats actually pretty sad cuz I cant really afford good pc atm I can notice the difference but I dont get the whole WHAT THE FUCK feeling that people seem to get is there a noticeable difference in TN and IPS i spent  on a hz monitor and the ports dont match my pc for the full hz experience Thats why I dont want to buy a hz monitor Im afraid it will ruin my experience in every other platform Or when you get your first hz monitor and dont realize you have to set your windows settings to actually use hz and use hz for months I just avoid the same way I avoid heroin life cant really be the same after youve had a go at that stuff Try switching to  FPS from hz Not fun I have only ever experienced hz but with vsync on I experience  tearing I now have hz and wow its amazing Scrolling looks like ass Imagine going from hz to  I made the mistake of trying out Hz and now I can never get ove how choppy my Hz monitor is I cant upgrade cos I still live with my parents and they claim that they cant see the difference and I must get over it  How I feel playing Astral Chain rn  Fax How to get a seizure I have a p hz and k hz side by side and they make me trip I have a hz monitor I hope its not bad

monitor and using my current hz as a second spotifyweb browsing monitors How badly will I hate my second monitor They really need to get a decent nonpanel lottery IPS hz out I need  hz but would also like the accuracy and angles of IPS LG has a promising looking one in the process of coming out but theres not much info on it out there I like hz Well I am using hz gsync on my laptop so I dont

automated message appears on  posts a day  overall only when a post reaches the top  of rall There was a Shadowrun on Cyberpunk  Huh isnt that ironic I read this as we are currently working on cyberpunk   Nice since it has hardly been talked about since that teaser release The thief sure is a cyberpunk Just like the Steve Harvey show that was leaked Hackers tried to ransom ABC for it and ABC was like Yeah NO Kinda weird since they had exact same issue with Witcher  Probably should invest more in security I hope CD Projekt Red knows that its fanbase has its back Any leaks could only further my anticipation for Cyberpunk  EDIT Lemme just clarify Any leaks could only further my anticipation regardless of if i partake in them Which i wont be Assuming otherwise is an uninformed viewpoint What a bunch of Novigrad whores Stealing from CD Projekt Red is like declaring war on Canada Everybody loves Canada Im being as patient as I can with Cyberpunk  I grew up playing a bunch of Cyberpunk  and Gamma World with my dad I have high hopes for this one Fuck those people asking for ransom People can be true assholes stealing shit and asking money not to leak information Im happy to know the large companies dont give in maybe someday theyll realize its a waste of time and finally leave everyone alone I hope these guys get caught and get what they deserve They should speak with Geralt he probably can help them track these guys When I bought he witcher It came with stickers an actual color game booklet a personal thank you letter And some other good stuff No other company still does stuff like this They put pride in their product and are thankful for their customers If I ever play another cd project red game it will be because I bought t not pirated it It honestly wouldve been pretty funny if they just pulled a fuck you and released it themselves making the theft completely useless This is how you handle a situation like this nice Why would anyone care enough about leaked artwork to think its worth ransom This is conveniently close to E CDPR are an amazing studio they even handle ransom in a classy way Ransomer pay us or well leak Cyberpunk  files CDPR wellgo on then that shits old anyways Ransomer wait what CDPR fuckin do it dare u bitch Cops already called bitch Gamers already know bitch Vision already changed bitch This is the best way to handle this I cant wait to give CD Projekt Red more of my money Its okay nothing will get me to doubt the love and effort CD PROJEKT RED puts into their games People love their games so much they are stealing them before they are even release made Edited Its actually really cyberpunk that someone stole digital files and are asking for a ransom for them You have to be a real dick head to do something like that to CD PROJEKT RED out of all people removed Either its a legit ransom or puts tinfoil hat on  President of CD Projekt reveals that A promotional campaign is planned Its element is a surprise so I can not even say when it appears Precisely because this moment is to be surprising  CDPR announces that hackers have stolen some data  The news is spreading in media for free btw  E is coming in a few days The light goes out astonished announcer says Whats happening hackers take over the scene and display stolen data I wouldnt even be surprised I hope this gets upvoted higer so more people see this CD handles this stuff so well To be honest CDPR is my all time favorite team Even if this game was released by pirated versions and someone gave it to me I would not play it solely for the purpose of Supporting CDPR They are a refreshing group that makes quality gaming experiences and so far have made me feel like they are not taking advantage of my wallet IMO they should be the standard in what all distributors and developers practices should be Not that im promoting piracy in anyway but i wish this happened to anyone other than CDPR Im looking at you EAUBISOFTACTIVISION Its an inside job I guess I dont really enjoy the witcher games but god damn do i respect the fuck out of CDPR removed  fuck whoever did this trashy ass fucks Hope they like old junk files and being fucked in prison for stealing them The only one company that doesnt rob the players gets robbed Life is not fair Why steal from the best game dev team out there  TLDR Do it bitch see if I care Just another reason to support CDPR I am yet to play a game from CS PROKEJT RED but I heard the Witcher series is a masterpiece so I will do it one day when I am too old for fast games Of all the companies to do this to CD Projekt Red is among the shittiest Great company that doesnt deserve this Thats shit situation but ultimately as a gamer Im going to buy Cyberpunk  regardless of some stolen codecontent I dont plan on viewing anything that CD Projeckt Red released about it anyway I feel confident that CD Projekt Reds reputation will supersede any negative that would come of this imagine if the entire story of the witcher  had been released early would it have made it any less of a game lol no these bullys need to go find someone else XD They should be ashamed of themselves for doing that to such a good devpub Why would you do this to arguably the best game developer to the gaming community Go steal EAs shit you dumbass Go steal ubis servevrs if you can even find them I love this company Seems to be the only company nowadays that releases a finished product on release day No  season pass or  different DLC packs and they actually make GOOD games Great games in fact Its like they actually care about their customers They are such a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry at least if your gonna hack into a company hack into EA or Ubisoft not CD project red whyyyy I like how they technically gave those with the ransom demands the middle finger At least we know theyre still working on it Its been  years since the trailer and Pondsmith interviews and CDPR has given us pretty much nothing since then I can understand why hackers would want to steal information about Cyberpunk being that its actually some new information about the game but why would you hold concept art and other early design materials for ransom Game studios on average only use about half of what is in the concept art and what they do use seldom appears like the finished product I for one will be staying away from any unofficial info on the game Hopefully Reddit complies enough to downvote any that gets posted What mother fuckers We finally get a developer like CDPR that genuinely cares about its products and those who purchase them and these dick holes pull this crap THANK YOU for not giving in who cares if punk bitches have your data Cant wait to see a release I played alot on paper I hope it follows to suit Good on them With BioWare fumbling CD has become my new favorite studio Like I dont feel bad when this happens to shit heads like Sony but CD Project Red Come on guys Ransom aside those guys are fucking boss Leave em alone I already own Witcher  and  on Steam so I went ahead and bought the first Witcher enhanced edition on Steam even though I already have the first release physical disc of that game Just to show them extra support and give my own personal fuck you to whoever tried to squeeze some money out of them Edit Looking through CD Projekt Reds game list and I didnt know theres a Witcher adventure game Guess Im buying that one too why is it that good companies always have to deal with shit like this and EA and boobiesoft is always okay why ransom a small company when u can ransom a big shitty one They should do their own ransom Game delayed until further notice Almost sounds like something a PR department would do for a game called Cyberpunk especially right before the biggest gaming convention of the year Fucking Asshats Go Harass Ubisoft Never negotiate with terrorists honestly this sounds like a PR stunt but it wouldnt be the first time a games files were leaked ahead of release Creative marketing there was no breach of data We gotta cut Russia off the internet Not in a million years would i ever pirate a game from this company They are so honest and just overall good Man CDPR is great I hope it lasts long This whole scenario sounds rather cyberpunk Theres no other company that deserves this shit LESS than CD PROJEKT RED Brilliant marketing Scandal intrigue immune to reddits antihail corporate attitude put them and their game out there Even pulling sympathymaking them seem like an underdog that users will want to support I imagine the files will be be released either just as the hype dies down or before release I dont whether this is just a stunt or for real but it doesnt matter They should be hugging the marketing person OR the hacker This is almost too appropriate I mean whats more cyberpunk than stealing files and holding them for ransom Anyone thinking this could be an ARG hack happend Good Guy hackerman just stole a bunch of d modelsjpgs from summer  Statement just goes out  WE ARE WAY FARTHER LALALALALA POLAND STRONK CANT HEAR YOU Im pretty sure this game is gonna be ship for  Hope my kids enjoy it i will be dead for a long time Ive never heard of this game but after seeing how they handle their PR and getting such great feedback on this thread Ive looked further in to the game and will think about buying it when it comes out Good job whoever stole these files you successfully aided CD PROJEKT RED in gaining more followers Looking forward to hearing of the repercussions for this prick Play cyber punk games win cyberpunk prizes In all honesty fuck these guys but also damn talk about cyberpunk Delivered with the utmost class and sincerity I love these guys CDPR are fuckin legends faced with a shitty situation they bring the fans in with the details GOOD I await their offical efforts with glee and fuck whoever stole this Why cant these fucking assholes steal from Activision EA and Ubisoft The world would be such a better place Alright guys someone tried to blackmail CPDR Lets team up with rcrackwatch and get them They got PUNKD Why do this to one of the few good gaming companies Its ea isnt it They always do right by the gaming community lets do right by them Honestly the them being early documents would make the documents interesting to see after the game releases The perfect example of a Dev that handles things with grace and tact I love these guys probably my fav devs ever Free DLC and true Expansions Legends This is so shit Cd project red are the best Dev team out there I love them and the way they interact with us and the way they care and put effort into all of their products why should this happen to them Classy af move Im impressed I actually respect CD Projekt and have faith in them so I wouldnt watch leaks about them Defending against stuff like this is super costly month to month so I get it but yeah this also happened with TW Maybe its time to spend that k on decent securityteam Fuck Printers Fuck printing too LPT Get a laser printer cost a bit more upfront but you will save tons on ink Edit And fuck printers they are jerks Be me change cartridge printer be like pls check tray for paper fill the fucking tray whack printer for good measure printer refuses to work delete printing queue send another print command

WTF I dont even print anything pink ever  I just want a black and white text  l o w o n p i n k me every time I use the color printer This would be perfect with the Patrick from spongebob format Fact printers are programmed to use all the colours even in low amount whenever you print black or white and are changing the black cartridges Best you can do is having a black white printer only IIRC Cyan is used to make blacks blacker AKA make you spend more money on colors Hello thank you for reading my comics you can see more on my Instagram Systemcomics Ah the good ol printing scam there is a tiny bit of Cyan added to black apparently it gives nicer black and is totally unrelated to them wanting to sell you more colored ink My Laser printer has a setting to shut this kind of thing off so I did of course Its been bitching about being low on toner for about  months yet still prints everything perfectly Printers really are the most annoying piece of tech out there Printers are just a scam they sell printers themself cheap so they can sell the ink for more expensive prices same with shaving razors and blades The reason why the printer needs cyan in black and white pictures is so the black would be more purely black and as you may guessed it its bull shit They add cyan to waste more ink so youd run out faster and buy more Tldr they add cyan in black and white to waste more inc and youd run out faster Also this video is prettt interesting httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvAHXtHdQGiQfeatureyoutubeutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf PC load letter What the fuck does that mean T E A M M O

Nanjianihttpwwwcccomvideoclipsikzumwuncensoredcolorprinter Step  buy a printer for less than buying ink Step  print about  pages Run out of ink Repeat step  FYI from the advanced settings you can select something like black ink only instead of high quality grey the default which uses colour cartridges to print in greyscale I dont remember where exactly you find those settings but its not too complicated you can access them throuh the printing menu in most document readers for example Printer ink is literally a scam Not even objectively Adding to the list of reasons why Im a physics student I never have to print anything Please insert  into a paper shredder before printing Spent the money and bought a laser printer a while ago never looking back Ive been forcing my printer to print with only black ink forever is this a thing There should be a law that mandates the max price of printer ink and standardize the cardridges Brother laser printer No color no bs just printed documents Fucking  printers and your budgillion dollar inks Thats why you should invest in a laser printer  Anyone got a secret to cheating this bs system Ive got so much crap I need to print I see youve got an HP printer If I may offer a suggestion Monochrome laser printers YOOOOO My printer just did this dumb shit the other day Like all I wanted was some documents in black and white and all i

covered the sensor with black electric tape and put them back in problem solved black ink only from now on Seriously with all our current computerrelated technology why are printers still The Worst Thing EverTM  Lol I had a printer do this to me and I got rid of it the next day Never been so mad in my entire life before The fact that we are able to play doom on almost anything with a screen why hasnt anybody been able to hack a printer so it just prints even without a specific kind of ink No fck you low on Yellow for me Our printer is luckily smart enough to not do that that is only the case though when a color is missing and black is adequate of course Printers are incredible By incredible I mean that its incredible that the only meaningful innovation in desktop printing over the last  years is the addition of WiFi Printers mix a little bit of colour with the black ink to finnes you of your ink Its a grand scheme Printers are a fucking scam I heard somewhere that printers need yellow and blue ink to print secret codes in the white areas of the paper This is used by detectives or somthing Pc load letter I got a laser printer secondhand and it was one of the best decisions

Brother if you can Inkjets have always been shit and probably always will be Printings a scam at this point there are cartridges out there that cost more that the printer The one benefit of having an office job is I can print whatever I want late at night after everyones gone home and not have to pay for anything Printers are the worst ever I swear  of support is just printer shit Anyone had that feeling when your work gets printed out its coming out and you start to see your work then it goes back inside for drying and then paper jammed Me  my work Printer dont eat my work Spit it out now Relevant Oatmealhttpstheoatmealcomcomicspensasprinters I can trick my printer into thinking the cartridge is full when it says its low Gets me at least x more ink Doesnt the fbi need to print yellow dots on all printers to track whos printing things Like to track murderers or more often people who leak sensitive government docs Im probably just crazy but I seem to remember that Some printer ink cartridges you can cover the area where the ink can be seen with black tape and trick the printer into thinking it is full Sodium pokyacrylate I think Edit typo The cyan is dyin Lol too true Some cheap consumer printers allow you to skip the low ink warning by holding the stop button for  seconds Goddamn printers Why is this so true Bledsoes a lion Get in the car Lol This thread reminds me how dumb people when computer skills can be Raise your hand if you regularly print color Most of you dont A huge majority dont In fact a lot of you dont print at home to begin with or print at all So the solution is but a brother laser printer and the toner will last over a year with printing Ink jets are given away like satellite dishes to get you hooked on the service Be smart Ever had a printer shit color ink to print black text Sorry I missed that black  white checkbox you fucking assholes Do people have color prints for just normal documentsreports Why not just a typical bw laser Theyre cheap as dirt now too Ive never owned a printer nor used one really and this is still making me laugh so much why Fun fact if you tape over the indicator it probably has plenty of cyan The printer at my work has been giving  ink warnings for over a month now it still prints just fine Even if the ink starts to fade a bit we just take out the cartridge shake it and its fine well un zips  i will fuck you for cyan I guess Ill be cyan ya later The Oatmeal did a comic on printers Everything in it FACT I may have laughed at this a bit more than I shouldve LETS PROCEED SLOWLY Laser printers ftw Whats bullshit is that the cyan isnt even low The stupid chip that says it is was designed that way just as it was designed to not even let you print in black and white when missing the color so that you have to go and spend more money on another overpriced piece of fucking garbage ink cartridge Well worth it to just spend the extra money on a decent thermal printer where the ink is built into the paper Cuz youll have to keep supplying paper anyway and that paper isnt that much more than regular paper hugs blackinkprinting printer My family had it for five years and its been going strong for a while Repost  rEpson Imagine if you marketed a printer that would print even if it was out of some random color Like it would just keep going with the next best color until it was completely out of everything That printer would be the industry standard in a month I NEED MAGENTA Office Space intensifies Print graph plot  Printer takes  minutes to produce a blurry washed out image that seems even more pale at the back end Print test page  Printer takes  seconds to spit out a rainbow of bars of color so saturated the page is practically dripping Vietnam flashbacks to magenta meme Today I found out that my printer driver is corrupted Its an all in one and I mostly use it to scan art patterns etc I uninstalled the driver and tried to reinstall it but it wouldnt finish the installation because the low ink error was preventing it from discovering the printer Printer used splash attack I thought I was the only one having crazy problems with my printer At one point i made a nice image on Word for a poster and printed it had an hour of problems then decided to change the image and print that it kept spitting out the old imagei didnt press print multiple times before i went nuts so I saved the document did some configs and turned on off the printer and thought it would override the first document Nope Went ballistic after  hours and broke it by slapping it so hard Legit happened to me the other day How did you know This is the truest thing Ive seen on this site in  My printer randomly decided black ink was too good for it Now I have a  lb glorified scanner and bought a laser printer One thing I remember learning from my time working at an Office supply store in the electronics department is you can trick some printers by covering the ink sensor on the cartridge with the respective color of electrical tape Its the ink cartridges with the little clear area where you can see the ink splash around inside printed something black and white today black was rich and white was white All grey tones were purple The sad thing is my D printers are more reliable and less of a ballache than my d one Fuck you CYM True story My printer Low on black ink Me Oh its okay this doesnt have any black in it its a rainbow Printer I dont give a shit buy black ink cyan low Me printing Miku anime wallpapers out for my binder Dont buy shit printers your paying for the ink not the printer lol Completely off topic But should I be ashamed of my budget HP elitebook p AMD Radeon m  gb vram  gb ram upgradable to   gb hard disk intel core i second gen  ghz printers are so shit these days they all rip you off Just change the settings in the print dialogmenu to force grayscale only and voila the printer no longer cares Furthermore in the same menu you can configure your printer to use some percentage of the blackwhite ink I have mine set to like  which is unnoticeable It saves a lot of money Suddenly you go from ppcartridge to pp FREE MONEY You already posted this elsewhere thus shall suffer the consequences Going through this same bullshit right now Life almost overhttpsproxyduckduckgocomiuuhttpAFFdtazadicdncomFwpcontentFuploadsFFFxeroxdramajpgFfnofb  color black Printers are shit If I didnt enjoy color prints so much I would just get a laser printer One way I have combated this is to refill my cartridges myself and disabling the ink monitoring settings on my printer Its a bit messy but Ive been on the starter ink cartridges for about two years now on this canon Ive lost count of how many pages Ive printed but Ive spent more on reams of paper than I have on ink Going to be installing a continuous ink system I bought for cheap real so I wont have to go through the trouble of refilling them anymore Set your document to black and white or else it will use color for colored black and white documents printers can be dicks like that LPT get a printer that only has black ink Remember to always buy LaserJet printers instead of these shitty  dollar printers with  of its ink preinstalled The ink cartridges are also overpriced for inkjet printers This very thing is happening here in my house  rhongkong Epson WF checking in Just ordered knockoff ink this morning Every other cartridge is full except cyan This should be illegal For anyone who actually doesnt understand why printers use color for BW documents a small mix of colored dye is used to create a unique tag that is virtually invisible to the human eye This tag traces the print back to your exact printer If you attempt to convey a threat to someone using a printed message the police can use the tag on your print to find the serial number of your printer and use the magic of papertrails to can you Just got a printer for work to print out a few  page  ring binder docs I havent had a printer for like  years so had no clue what to buy just picked a cheap one at random While Im using it for the first time I realize this  page pdf will take  pages unless its front and back To my pleasant dismay the thing can print front and back and not skip a beat Printing front and back changes everything Now go buy this ink the company produced for  pence and pay  pounds for it Its cuz they print with a little bit of cyan even when you print black and white My inkjet lets doesnt use ink cartridges but it has a cap instead so you can refill it with inkcosts  a bottle you can even use counterfeit inkaround  its epsons L series printers httpswwwepsoncoidForHomePrintersInkTankcitfr MAGENTA Fucking lmao Been researching this and you can fadely see the yellow dots if you look carefully and I think its something to do with to stop people from counterfeiting items such as bank notes or if people do counterfeit then they can trace it back to the printer You can only see the yellow dots if they are on darker shades and if you look really closely but otherwise not noticeable Still if I needed a printer I would probably get a Lazer one cos buying ink all the time is a pain in the neck as a pose to toner which is allot less frequent You can also get a hp laser jet for less then  these days and plus ink jets make the paper all weird and quality is awful I would definitely try seeing if its possible to change the firmware in the printer to stop the yellow dots cos I know it would make me scan each print looking for yellow dots that I see as faults in my master peace  I use a printer for printing music Thinking of a Lazer printer since Im spending like usd for black ink and  for tricolor And they dont print as many pages frt Arent there scannerprinter hybrids that refuse to Scan if youre low on some type of ink At least Im pretty sure Ive run into one in the past We need freedom respecting open hardware printers Time to throw it out and buy a new printer with full cyan I work on IT help desk for a printer company can confirm fuck printers RiChEr BlAcK And when you use toner it will try to get you to replace it when its still at   rprogrammerhumor Can confirm Well yeah if your printer is an HP I have one of those Epson Printer that does that What i did is just replace it with refillable ink printng press is the only true printer Buying a black and white laser printer from Brother was one of the best decisions ever My old inkjet would stop working every two weeks while the printer I have now always works but human eye can only see R G and B Buy a laser printer never print in color problem solved Fuck inkjet printers Lazer printers for life yo Just get a laser printer that cuts the words out of the paper and the only way to read it is to shine a light through it This is the most relatable meme I have ever seen m a g e n t a lmao good one Ive heard some companies program their printers to use a little bit of cyan even when printing in black and white They justify it by saying it adds depth to the black but fuck me Canon I want to print my pet insurance claim form to get my  back not frame it for my gallery wall Get a laser printer if you must have a printer This isnt a problem with those What printers are you getting that do this Ive never seen a more relatable post why is this exactly how my printer behaves This is so true on my Epson printer I now believe that printers add a bit of colour to black ink so you run out faster The magenta meme died a long time ago Yup Printers hate humanity its the only explanation evry tiem i tri This is an intentional design flaw to get you to buy more ink Printers are also designed to only accept specific brand ink they use chips in the cartridge iirc to further extort you Im not even OUT of cyan Just low Priorities Wish this applied to going to work Boss Hey can you email this message for me Me low on sleep B No problem heres some coffee to get you through the day M doesnt like coffee low on sleep proceeds to walk out lol I have an old printer its always does that  This is the most relatable comic Ive ever seen lmao XD relatable af I just bought a new Canon printer  days ago wondering if that fucker will stop printing black text if the colors run out This is just printer companies trying to save the environment by making it very expensive andor difficult just to print some shit haha the printer said fuck I have a printer but I know a guy that hacks printer cartridges so I get cheap refills My HP printer prints everything anyway no matter if it is low on ink Printers got me like Bruh changes cartridge prints  pages Low ink alert Too low ink level Buy a new cartridge for  throws printer into garbage I can create complex networks Develop software Build a complete CICD to AWS or Azure But printers thats my darn kryptonite I hate Printers My inks were low Ordered a  pack on amazon I insert all of them but ofc the printer didnt recognize the black Now I have to order more black for  dollars might I add The old black cartridge isnt empty but it didnt have enough black to print anything in black n white I fucking love it Imma get a laser printer when my  year old inkjet finally kicks the bucket I cant sell it because its almost worthless and Ive already bought a small box of cheap chinese ink carts for like  each I want to print this and put it on the color printer at work but its low on cyan This resonates with my soul Im in this cyan bullshit situation right now This is like Adobe programs refusing to start if your driver date is a couple months old Theres a reason for this httpsenwikipediaorgwikiRichblack Better than my printer that tells me I have  black and then prints the blackwhite document in bloddy magenta I even set it to a blackwhite print and sometimes its randomly in magenta You dont know how many times this has happened to me pisses me off every time rassholedesign Ill never buy a HP inkjet printer again because they started practicing planned obsolescence with cartridges Skinning your sheep is a great way to not have any sheep anymore Was going to print this out and tape it to the side of my printer Turns out Im out of yellow ink BuT iT mAkEs ThE bLaCk BlAcKeR I buy a  printer from walmart and when it runs out of ink I smash it Office Space style with my roommates and then go buy another  printer from walmart Its the only way I know to deal with the stress of owning a printer whats the worst brand of printer so I can ignore that brand Im planning on getting one for schoolwork I replaced cyan today this is why I have a fucking monochrome laser printer connecting via parallel port that shit is simply indestructible Some are coded to stop printing before they run out of ink Meanwhile im here with a D printer and want a normal one Thanks dad  Day of the tentacle was my jam Paper Towel present  accurate Good luck playing with that madafakin sun shining straight into your eyes Unreal Tournament still works on Windows   years later EDIT Proof I tried running my favourite mod of all time Infiltrationhttpinfiltrationsentrystudiosnet just a few months ago on my W PC It works just fine httpsgfycatcomGreedyBronzeHorsefly Nostalgia overload I love it Granted they take up a ton of space theres nothing like getting a physical copy of some form of media Especially if it comes with a cool maunual or guide with lore of charactersmonsters and locations I missed out on the physical release of PC games but on the other hand I dont have a CDDrive and everything is neat in my Steam Library so thats also nice Wow Under A Killing Moon I never see that game mentioned It was one of the few Full Motion Video game  interactive movies of that era that was any good Even has the voice of James Earl Jones in it That map is dust from  but the ma and hand models are from cs source  The Grim Fandango poster sold me You need a curtain or bedsheets over that window As a  year old gamer this makes me feel like the golden age of gaming is behind us EDIT I really liked reading the responses to this comment Yes nostalgia is definitely a major factor however I have not fired up a game in the last  years that has given me the sense of wonder that playing Diablo   Baldurs Gate Fallout WoW Vanilla Quake   III Arena online I could go on for a while Thing is I still play most big new titles and dabble in a lot of the more popular indie titles I can say that nothing is exciting like it used to be  for me The games are much much prettier but innovative game play environment and content is just not impactful for me anymore Maybe Ive outgrown games but I think that games are no longer made to wow anyone I think games are made to constantly remove money from your bank account above all else New games almost feel like there is a psychologicalsociological team designing them to keep you wanting to buy just one more loot box EDIT Wow Double Gold You other old farts get me Command and conquer too much nostalgia I wasnt prepped Had to sit down The artist has excellent taste in games Oh how I miss Quake III Arena Awesome work deleted I can smell this picture deleted As much as I loved my old games I wish I could have a mixture of both past and present If I could get a game that had the gameplay and creativity of the games of yore with the technical aspects of the current generation Id be happy Everything nowadays seems to sack everything for a cash grab Want to get ahead Buy the ultra mega premium god shark edition and get access  hours earlier Want to have a character model that doesnt look like boiled assholes covered in  day old ketchup Buy these loot boxes and you MIGHT get the skin youve always dreamed of Base skins have minimal particle effects animations and texture resolution We will later rework the character out of sheer boredom and rerelease the boiled assholes skin as a Classic Skin for an exorbitant amount of money with an extremely low drop rate in the loot box system What Im really nostalgic for is when people who made and sold games actually liked gaming Now theyve turned into only caring for shareholders Even Blizzard who I used to love for their Its done when its done motto Even theyve gone to shit Ill never forget those days played since v scrim mIRC  Long live CS I joined pcmr in  too late I gather nowbut I felt like an elite watching Matrix Reloaded on Powervideo through my  inch crt It seemed absurdly cool at the time that could watch a movie on a pc If you bought Max Payne you would be using the free mouse pad I miss the oversized pc game boxes man I wish I kept mine from when I was a kid Your missing the DFX poster Glide does what OpenGL dont Love that halflife is on the forefront That game convinced me to be a pc gamer for life Wheres all the cigarette butts and mountain dew bottles ah man what got me is the Magazine on the keyboard as a kid i loved getting home and finding the game informer magazine ohh the feeeels this gives might have to make this my background for awhile LGR battlestation I wish I had had so many games Battlefield  spent so many hours playing it Damn this nade me feel like I was   my parents were still together Muh heart deleted I can hear the PC in this picture Wheres San Andreas Cheat script  Instagram was around then My childhood right there Thanks dude not trying to be critical But the perspectives are wrong The  the floppy under the CRT and where is the PC buyers guide tools  its amusing as I know I had a bunch of those titles but never posters Not unless you got swag or worked at a computerelectronics boutique Needs more neverwinter nights and Heroes of Might and Magic but this hit my feels Look I loved games back in the day but I wouldnt go back because I can play then today together with new games I like the nowadays no more clutter and steam So accurate Dmn The sweet game boxes and manuals are what I really miss I got the StarCraft edition with Protoss on the front and I was super proud of it I think it was textured and everything Everquest caused me to miss out on all those other games  Wow I owned almost every single game pictured at one point I feel old as fuck now Edit I was totally interested in purchasing a print but the actual sale version has his Instagram listed That ruins the image When you bought the game you owned it Games stayed alive as long as people were playing them not when the developers decided it wasnt profitable anymore You could mod with abandon without worrying if you were going to get banned for some skins and sound effects Every game is a service you subscribe to in some fashion now You cant host your own servers all servers are run by the publisher You cant mod even to fix the things the developers find unprofitable to focus on or youll be banned and your  goes down the tube We need to go back Looks like my life  Wheres the Perpendicular keyboard sips Conquests of Camelot  the search for the holy grail A Sierra classic Got the same box sitting on my own shelf Can still remember wandering the desert and seeing mirages solving the riddles at Stonehenge getting impaled by the portcullis for forgetting to pray to the gods good times The PC Gamer mag is clearly photoshopped Otherwise nice photograph  Quake  What no Original Quake Eh You still get a upvote tho But at least you included Quake III arena  PC gaming is still good The chillins will never understand GoG Deus ex starcraft unreal tournament that brand of tower of cds one with mp written on it very accurate I see Morrowind I upvote One of my favorite RPGs Follow me on Instagram That was not the good old days I can tell the comment section is gonna be rose colored elitist glasses garbage xB Before the flood of microtransactions and games as a service I guess instagram has been around longer than I thought Im gna say it games were better back then I feel like PC Gaming was for elites back then But I was just a child There was never any good old days They are today they are tomorrow Its a stupid thing we say Cursing tomorrow with sorrow  Gogol Bordello Very dope pic Right in the feels I like how this image was rendered and a nice collection of games but I do prefer everything in digital now and on a cloud to reduce clutter Almost made me cry and now is my wallpaper Love the Commodore in the back Where are the gallons of water This is great and sad at the same time I miss when LANs were the biggest thing I had to worry about Fuckin beautiful Holy shit thats awesome you all have been played there was no instagram back then deleted These games seem to span  years So unrealistic Instagram wasnt a thing then s Monkey Island My first game Feelsgoodman Who the fuck had a Windows  poster Probably the same kind of person to leave half eaten doughnuts on the desk Needs more heroes of might and magic That EverQuest poster brings back good memories Wait a minute They didnt have Instagram back then All it missing is the Battlefield  box Everquest and counter strike ahhhhhh my childhood  Having to delete everything on your harddrive other than your operating system in order to JUST about squeeze on Day of The Tentacle The good ol days Its from Instagram weve come full circle Took me too long to find the diablo  Lost way too much time in that game I miss command and conquer Wish I was more grown up  started playing games earlier because this was the golden age I miss the physical boxes They looked so good on the wall And those magazines Every month you were desperately waiting to see what free game  demos are on the CD this time Unreal Tournament Mmmmmm MEGA KILL Them asking to be followed on Instagram really broke the immersion Like I went back and time and then I was yanked out by a flipping sticky note Instagram wasnt a thing was it Those blinds are way too open day of the tentacle hollaaa Where the hell did they get a picture of my desk in  And why did they only draw one of the  coke cans No Rainbow Six No sale Needs more Mtn Dew Remember when pcgamer had patches on the floppies and then CDs A god send to several of my playthroughs Fuck that picture describes my youth  Im sad now Thanks the spindle of verbatim blank CDRs is a nice touch I still play Warcraft  today such an amazing game This almost made me tear up Nostalgia overload Add xwing vs tie fighter and a old Microsoft sidewinder joystick and it would have been perfect This image reminds me a lot of Padshop map by Padman on Quake III Arena You play the size of an ant in a shoproom just like this I go back from time to time and play against bots on those Pad maps theyre really fun even with the bots God LANparties were a mess especially bigger ones Youd have to carry a heavy CRT and a tower around hope you didnt smash anything friend of mine once had a cooler come off the socket and once a HDD developed some issues and still have a back pack with shit like Jolt Snickers and weed And you better had all your patches Often times Id also take my mouse with me when taking a shit because some asshole once swiped my freaking Razer Boomslang That was an expensive mouse back then Interesting times Damn that CS Very nice artwork Missing those old days Um where is diablo  or  or both What in the fuck Edit nm I see it now Im a happy boy Man I miss those days Glory days of  and my teenage years The quality of this post is unreal Great work REAL nostalgia would have the gun in CS on the left not the right  Unreal tournament and Team Fortress classic where my go to online games then This hit so hard in the feels so so hard I could hear the k dial up symphony playing the rows of coke cans and water bottles the feel of the mouse pad the windows  login screen when blizzard was a good company and battlenethttpsbattlenet was the most amazing thing ive ever seen xB playing such amazing games being completely in awe and wonder at Everquest man to be honest guys I feel like I was blessed to have experienced all that CS   best CS Diablo  Cs  and AoE my life as a kid Right in the feels Wow  and under a killing moon damn bruh I feel like im playing one of those detective games to find certain items when i look at this image Good GodStarcraft  Quake Max Payne The Matrix PC Gamer Half Life CS CC Diablo II WC Frozen Throne Everquest DAoC Duke Nukem Atomic Jedi Knight GTA Silent Hill LoTR Deux Ex a spindle of CDs Windows XP coffee  a donutI seriously grew up in the golden time of gaming This is such an awesome picture with fantastic little details I love it This was the golden age We lost the sense of wonder because of a human trait Adaptation We got so used to amazing graphics and good storylines that we ceased to be amazed because those things are standard now It happens with everything This was my life Missing the Taco Bell wrappers and the watered down week old Baja Blast Fuck how i miss those days Im sad now I really enjoyed this I looked at this picture for about ten minutes and talking to my wife about it I had everyone of these games at some point when I was younger She freaked when she saw everquest her favorite old game Thanks for sharing this The nostalgia is real in this one I miss the old blocky green steam overlay its still there in cs  That Quake  arena man good times Learn about us and our historyhttpspcmasterraceorghistory PCMR isnt just a subreddit

saying this to my friends when they flip out over my setup Like Im the crazy one But can I play on my desktop while pooping thats worth  right there But can your PC make animojis Didnt think so honey I know this is a meme but it raises a point in the general direction phones are going We are paying more and more for features that make the device easier to use but that dont necessarily expand on what you can use the phone for What I would really like to see is a push towards using a phone in place of a laptop something that you can connect mouse keyboard and monitor to wirelessly and use full applications on I think then it will warrant the high price tag If I could pay  a month for two years interest free to finance a  gaming PC with the option of trading that PC in for the latest and greatest after  payments I would totally do it But PC is too expensive Oh and speaking of I think Im getting the new iPhone NSA We need D scans of everyones face Apple We gotchu fam How about I skip both and use that money for my student loan theres no monitor mouse and keyboard how are you gonna play telepathy and oh my god theres no power supply are you gonna wait for a thunder when you want to use it Comparing two totally different things You dont carry your gaming PC with you daily and make phone calls or text and you dont game on your iphone Also you can get another phone for cheap just like you can build a cheap gaming computer I know this sub has a raging hateboner for everything Apple but isnt this comparison a bit potandkettle This is a sub in part about paying out the nose for super highend PC parts Buying a  Ti or two or a K monitor or the latest CPUs or RGB out the nose none of that is particularly costefficient And thats fine because for those buying it theyre into it They like it and they use the shit out of their machines so its fine Yet someone doing the same with their phone is suddenly ridiculous Why not both I mean yeah a PC is way stronger but I think there is something to be said about It fits in your pocket It has a screen included It has a good camera It has an operating system included I think cell phones are over priced but still they are pretty amazing Honestly I get it Ha ha apple products cost a lot of money Im a diehard PC user like a great deal of us here But it isnt like you have to buy an iPhone You absolutely could buy a cheaper Android that has basically everything an iPhone has like so many of you have pointed out People buy iPhones because they are easy to use I dont think Apple has ever claimed to be on the forefront of technological advances They take a great deal of already existing impressive technology and make it simple accessible and intuitive to use k for what is arguably the best version of the best smartphone on the market is not an unthinkable thing to ask If you dont have a thousand dollars dont buy an iPhone X If you do from my experience with the  I cant not recommend Apples phones But can you take your PC outside and show ppl that you are made out of money Thats right I didnt think so I am using the phone more than I would use the PC to be fair This thread is pathetic Can you take your pc to work Spend hours in bed with it Take it on the plane I love my pc too but come the fuck on people can spend their money on things they want without having dickheads mocking them for it But the difference is form factor Just like with gaming laptops you have to pay a premium for the smaller size You can leave the house with the phone Are we all just ignoring that the Note is priced similarly Oh this is just another antiapple circle jerk Cool Well I just spend  on a single Lego set RAM prices next yearhttpsiimgurcomzXdOOCjpg Heh Here where i am that just barely gets me a  ti Help me out man i am losing faith in the PC It is just not worth it I even resorted to asking system builders to quote me traded in  tis in this AMD rush Check out the money police over here You want a nice PC and a cheap android phone do that you want a reasonable PC and an iPhone do that you want a nice PC and iPhone do that I really dont care its your money spend it how you want Im going to go worry about other things This is dumb Lets make fun of people for spending their disposable income how they please I think the guy carrying around a PC tower everywhere he goes will look like a bigger asshole than someone with an iPhone x Some of us can afford both The difference between the  and the x is Mo and I have an Iphones to trade in You use your phone a lot Sure go buy an expensive one if you want Dont use it much Just get a cheapo android phone from AliExpress Same applies with PC Its about how much its worth to you This isnt even a comparison youre comparing apples to oranges One is a mobile device the other is a desktop The reddit hive mind thought they made a valid point  Man switch out the i for a k series i and get yourself a  instead of a  I mean what are you even doing man Come on This is like rgatekeeping adjacent Because I can definitely carry my desktop in my pocket Except I only spend a few hours a day at most on my PC and mostly use it for browsing and consuming media I spend all day with my iPhone I use it to pay for food beer traveling listening to music talking to friends browsing consuming media etc the list can go on forever The thing is I dont think I know a single person whod buy a phone full price They all get it subsidized through their service provider Firstly Why the fuck are you pairing a goddamn  with a watercooled i Secondly I cant put a PC in my pocket Thirdly where is your monitor peripherals Power supply and OS lmao imagine being able to buy both and still have money left This meme includes everything except what the phone is most A monitor input devices and operating system Or both But I already have a bitchin ass computer and want a fancy phone Why cant you have both uh apples and orangesunless you can fit your PC in your pocket and take it with you full wardrobe shoes and bag at macys or  chanel handbag same shit Or you can get a garbage can I mean mac pro Why not both Or both I like both phones and PCs And why not if youve got the cash Youd think pc users would understand the difficulty cost and significance of scaling down the technology into a phone and making it relatively durable Sure its a status symbol for some but from an engineering standpoint its pretty miraculous Im sure lots of money was spent on developing aesthetics but thats just the world we live in I guess Lets be honest a phone is more practical than a PC if you can only have  of the two Maybe you should not buy the most expensive iPhone but maybe any of the options Apple offers now SE s  and X A phone is so much more useful  for something I use all day every day doesnt seem strange to me at all Most hipster tech mags Yes mobile gaming is the future PC is dying out soon there will be none left and all will be mobile gaming Youve been saying that for how long I wish I could make that PC for  Canadian  No monitor no keyboard no mouse no power supply You sure you got everything on that highend computer to compare to that highend phone In fact getting an OLEDHDR monitor would almost double the price of that PC Ill just drag my computer everywhere with me now Laughs in Debian But really when did PC become synonymous with the Windows operating system I have a PC and a Mac because I like both and you cant fucking stop me Edit The gold made that k iMac worth it PC good Mac bad amirite gamers xB someone is probably going to say macs are also PCs and then someone is going to correct them based on the new definition this whole circle jerk is a huge never ending cycle of the same shit and now Im wondering why i bothered to type this out at all Being subbed to both PCMR and rMac it really does feel like the I feel bad for you I dont think about you at all meme Nothing says were better than you like constant insecurity and justification This is grade a weaponized stupid rComedyCemetery deleted Why does this sub make the worst memes Plot twist He already ate the mac it is fast because he is running Had the chance to make a funny meme instead makes some stupid generic post This comes off like an awful FB meme Does this even make sense I mean the new Mac Pro will be astronomically powerful PC  Mac but this is just dumb This format doesnt even make sense for the joke Dont most military areas still use s and s computers with floppy disks Since its much easier to maintain and impossible to hack I hear I highly doubt Area  would use modern macs for there stuff MacOS is faster than Windows if were speaking purely about efficiency Almost any modern Unixlike operating system will be faster Its the new Mac Pro supposed to be a  core TB of RAM having monster Also Macs cost more for sure but they also have a longer average life span and a higher resale value rgatekeeping would be proud of this one Laughs with MacOS installed on a PC Mac is an OS Windows is an OS Macs come at a premium but are plenty fast The benefit of building a PC is the upgradability and pricetoperformance ratio I built my own PC so Im obviously a fan of PCs but if youre gonna compare them to Macs at least be honest in your argument The biggest problem with Macs is the overpriced CPUs they use in combination with anemic GPUs and cooling And lots of nongaming OEMs do that for some reason Bruh new Mac Pro coming this fall has tb of ram That can run like  chrome tabs The salt in here is wild so the Mac Pro I have both and it feels good to have a Mac too cuz it really makes pc gamers insecure lmfao Isnt mac a form of a PC I was going to post a sassy comeback but I needed to install my th cumulative update of the month then Windows Defender needed to do some shit then IE and Edge fought over which browser was shittier then the WiFi went into AirPlane mode because why wouldnt a desktop PC need an airplane mode in case I need to use it on a plane then the WiFi nic drivers updated for the rd time this year and then my mom made me clean my room because I live at home in my parents basement When I was done and came back the computer went to sleep but bluescreened waking up so I reinstalled Windows  then upgraded to  then it installed the th cumulative update oh no Im in a loop I give you a  for effort All else being equal a Mac IS going to be faster than a PC just because MacOS is more efficient than Windows Psshhh DOS prompt for life isnt a mac a personal computer with a different operating system Im pretty sure theyre as fast as each other if you get the maximum possible specs on both Also this debate is stupid Get over it and get the computer you like Who cares if the one you dont have is faster if the one you have is fast enough than thats fine I mean what pc Macs arent good for the money but they are better than the Pentium Dual pc from the local school Whats A Computer But a Mac IS a PC Me leaving Area  with an Area  gaming pc from Alienware  Mac is better than Windows I think you mean Hey But is your pc better than a Mac Troy gave me this haircut Its a badass haircut I run both like a lot of people here apparently I have an Air for basic stufftravel and a beast Pchackintosh for music productionsome graphics designoccasional gaming I dual boot and use MacOS for everything on it besides gaming obviously As someone whos used macs for a long time but started building custom PCs as a kid and also used windows exclusively for a long time windows is a hot pile of burning shit and always has been it blows my mind how bad it is whenever I need to get into it and configure drivers etc I believe the corporate worlds adoption of windows as standard is a huge blight on the history of humanity and productivity worldwide would see a huge increase if we could just yeet it out of existence lol But for  value youll never get close to building your own PC by buying a Mac Which is why I just build my own now  Would make sense for gaming but debatable elsewhere You have to admit MacBooks are a good fucking laptop Well The topspec new Mac Pro will probably blow anything PC can throw at it though on prosumerlevel just by having that dual VII card and  TB of RAM Sure its expensive as hell but hey it does beat PC Nice I feel like this is a whoosh but Arent Macs just pcs with MacOS Isnt PC Master Race about games on PC being better than consoles Why do Macs keep being brought up when nobody even pretends theyre gaming machines laughs in FPS upvoting this on my macbook MAC BAD PC GOOD nothing better than pandering to an audience With a Mac you can play games like Breakout and Super Breakout Whenever someone says thisI think of that one kid in school who tries to fit inand I also thinkuneducated I personally despise alot of apples practicesand im forced to integrate apple devices into my  computer windows environment at work I dislike them probably more than most and I know apple equipment very deeply However its a case by case basis Any issues I have have never been apple itself always either my issue or our mdm provider If I didnt game I would personally be on Linux Ive never had any issues with Apples OS It is optimized so well and I have never ever had issues with it Windows  has been a trash can from the get go and you can imagine me being a sysadmin I delay and test ALOT before rolling things out Look yes its expensive Everyone knows that If you are smart you buy used just need to do alot of research and know where to look maybe you have a friend who could give it a once over Obviously gaming is not supported well on Mac OS and honestly if thats your main goal just use windows You can always use bootcamp and run a windows OS If I ever end up seeing a used Mac PRO one day years later I definitely think it would be fun to boot windows off of it All I am saying istry it for yourself sometime if you get a chanceI like alot of things on every platform We went from shitting on consoles to mac Its called a hackintosh For school and work a MacBook Pro is really just better imho Ive owned a ton of windows laptops and Ill never buy another This if my first MacBook and I wont need a new PC for at least  years Ive never had a Windows PC that lasted over  years without some sort of catastrophic failurebad mem HD dies keyboard issues and I spent  on  of them Plus I have an iPhone and they work seamlessly together Sure I paid for that peace of mind But i am completely okay with that And I keep a windows desktop for gaming This post pleases me I love that the guard is Mark fucking walberg lol A Mac is a PC unpopular opinion But a Mac is a pc I mean The new Mac Pro is configurable up to TB DDR and like GB VRAM I dont think theres a machine alive that can compare to the new Mac Pro coming out Come on A  Mac is definitely hmster than a  PC Not by much but definitely faster I wish I could game on macs tbh MacOs  Windows imo Macs will always be faster unless they release PC  Alright Im unsubbing Our Lord and Savior will providehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoHlyPsfuo Made me think of an old film called Mac and Me Mark Wahlberg Is that you Where does my chrome book rank Love the format Nice You run out of Area  with Alienware Hey that solider looks familiar linus laughs in hackintosh why are u RUNING Hey its the government They have contracts with HP Dell and Microsoft I like windows  I can run some pretty exotic hardware and softwaregames with no problems at all But a shell in LinuxUnix can open up a whole new world of understanding of computers So I use both Linux and Windows I use unix for my back end firewall in my belt and suspenders setup at home Mac PCs are just to proprietary and way overpriced But the iPhone is where its at IMHO for mobile devices I find those phones are well thought out So that being said different strokes for different folks Personally Im an omnifanboy I like all technology and see the merit in many devices and operating systems Had me in the first half not gonna lie I just built my first rig since  httpspcpartpickercomlistXdcbNQ Gonna start playing Divinity original sin  soon but anyone got any other recommendations I havent played anything but DotA civ  or The Witcher series in the last  years Might replay mass effect and finally play the third one or okay TW on ultra settings for the hell of it idk This is so stupid I love it Us your PC faster You cannot see the Mac because its not there Leave with PC instead Its funny because they totally use IBM processors Good meme bad format Ive seen a Mac faster than a pc I used the pc to record it and the Mac shot out of a cannon Mac and PC crew because Mac is great for work and windows is necessary for gaming Maybe when windows can actually release WSL and have a terminal that isnt trash Ill be a win main again Mac OS and the trackpad I will never buy any windows laptop for those reasons and the production ready

automated message appears on  posts a day  overall only when a post reaches the top  of rall Yup wish all games did this In this day and age it baffles me how this kind of thing isnt default in all D games So simple and welcoming for new gamers This should be standard I never knew what difference so many settings actually made Damnit i could have taken Ghost Recon Wildlands with my  purchase but I took For Honor  deleted I am not fond of Ubisoft But this is freaking awesome Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Wildlands Youre welcome if recent ubisoft games can get anything right it is a settings menu Damn thats some good settings menu This is great and all but I just wish some games  at the very least  had a description of some of the settings and how they impact performance Having to checkuncheck each box and try to tell what changed tends to be very annoying If only the game was actually any fun But great settings menu For sure Hey OPhttpsgfycatcomPeriodicGoldenAfricangoldencat Honestly wish more games had this As a fairly new PC gamer I constantly have to adjust settings to get a better frame rate while not seeing an immediate graphic change I love nvidia settings guides Even if my card could max it if i could get those extra frames changing settings that I wouldnt see much difference in Id rather trade ultra for  frames if there was no difference I would notice with the game in motion Too low quality cant even read tbh what i appreciate more is that once you max out turn a setting down to its lowest it stops and doesnt loop around to lowultra again when clicking one too many times wish all games had that See I dont know what ANY of these settings actually do which fucking kills me and this right here should be a standard What game is this If all games implemented this there would be a lot less confusion in the subject of graphics settings This should be the standard for all games It should be mandatory the name of the game in the title when posting gifs of one Ghost Recon Wild Lands at the start or end of the title is enough Every game needs something like this as well as an ingame benchmark tool to show realtime changes in performance to the extent possible as some changes often require a restart of the program deleted Yea its really good with the preview more games should do it However I still think serious Sam s settings menu is the absolute best due to the sheer detail and explanation for each setting as well as what hardware it is limited by in your pc More effort went into the setting s menu than the game itself Yes BUT this game is still a piss poor optimized POS CPU usage is insane and ram usage is undetermined Hey no wonder its Ubisoft A categorized list of reasons to complain about graphics Sure to be a hit with gamers who bitch more than a puppy mill My next game will be textbased and run only in a Linux terminal It will also have an ingame function to lodge complaints with the developer Each time the function is used the game will introduce another subtle inconsistency in the user interface and objectives that will make it impossible to win Think World of Warcraft where you file a ticket bitching because the graphics are dated Five minutes later your level  legendaryencrusted monument to unemployment is standing with his hand down his pants in Goldshire Suddenly a naked level  berzerker gorilla rockets out of the ground vigorously removes your characters face and bans you from the game forever So let it be written So let it be done UBis been doing that for all the games lately  Steep does the same Its like they expect us to forget all theirmisdeeds with actually helpful options menus  is that stuff patented Much better than toggling a single setting and waiting for an eternity for it to apply I dont think Ive ever seen a game where you can turn the shadows off this would be really great because honestly i have no idea which most of this stuff means i just try to get the most high and biggest numbers This needs to be STAPLE for any game Congratulations you sir have sold a game Wildlands by far best menu Game was shit but this menu was great Posting something good about Ubisoft on reddit Thats a bold move Does it have FOV slider and another option to turn or reduce the head bob Huh People always say Anisotropic filtering doesnt matter past like x but theyre according to this really really wrong Every game should do this Steep was one of the first games to do this Looks like Ubisoft will keep doing this in all their following games Can we PLEASE make it a rule to state the game name in titles for posts like these for once ubisoft is improving  kinda Matchmaking settings Mic and Language It matches you with someone who either has or does not have a mic based on if you do or dont have one respectively and matches you ONLY with people with the same language setting Why cant all games do this Can we all take a minute to berate OP for not putting the fucking game in the title Tfw the only thing people are praising your game about is the settings menu People say its only fun coop but I enjoy playing solo Sure it can get repetitive but thats when you change up your style of attack Natural Selection  actually runs the game in the background panning around a detailed scene applying your changes live so you can see in both details and fps what youre settings are doing I wish they were all like that There is a special place in hell for OPs who fail to include the game in their title The only thing that game got right Ghost recon is the one game that makes my  sweat at p All settings menus for EVERY game needs to be like this Hold on Ubisoft did something well This is fantastic Wow The way it should be done I also wish the game did an autotest of the system setting every value and then running a demo spitting out at the end a percentage for each setting based on how much it affects the framerate Shame the game is a unfinished feeling buggy goofy unoptimized mess Seriously Everything from the graphicsbugged TAA texture popin even on a TI etc to the gunplayridiculously slow bullet velocity and crazy dropis wonk My friends bought this shit for me so I would play with thembut even they stopped after like  hours of laughable everything Id go as far as to say this settings menu is the best most polished coolest part of the entire game lol Ive had more fun using it than playing Every fucking game should do this or something like this Been PC gaming for forever and I still cant always figure out which AA method is best in some games or what they even mean Its like LGBT the shit gets longer every years AA SSAA HBAO HBAO ASS or whatever Terrible game great menu deleted brilliant at minimum settings menus should explain what they are changing at best they should show it Even though GTA IV was kinda a shitty port it did do this I was impressed Definitely the first thing I loved about the game before I even loaded in Good Job Devs for doing this one right I wish all games had this and I wish all games had a Benchmark for both GPU and CPU similar to War Thunder Yes Yes we can This is how it should be done Especially if the rest of the example scenes are based on other settings currently applied This is one of the first times Ive ever actually seen anistropic filtering have a large effect on a game Seriously I rarely pay any attention at all to things like that Do others on here notice it massively or agree with me Unfortunately the settings menu was probably the best part about that game It should be called I got eyes on a small group of tangos The Game nVidia does this from some games in web form the only thing i could wish they would add is fps drain per setting More games need to provide this would love it for Overwatch Watchdogs  had amazing settings too not a preview like this but every setting you could possibly want with explanations This is so perfect and so obvious that now Im retroactively mad at every game that doesnt have this Im still not gonna play it but I guess Ubis still capable of some innovation Wow this needs to be the standard Its these little things that Ubisoft does right But how i hope the optimization would be the one they added to that list But yea i give credit where its due and Ubisoft does deserve credit for this PS they did this kind of thing with Watch Dogs  and Steep too need this for CSGO dont know what the fuck Im losing by setting it to low so my Mac wont piss its pants trying to run the game My microwave does this when i put it in potatoe mode Agreed it was a truly PCMR menu More of this sort of thing please PC Games Industry  Can we all take a minute to depreciate the screen capture of this settings menu What the pixelblurry hell is going on here One of the best ive seen tbh As a developer I really can appreciate that All that is is a series of images It would not be too hard to capture those images ingame and just show them associated with each setting value The hardest part of that is coming up with the idea to do it really This is possibly the most useful thing ever Bioshock infinite has a similar one Id like to but I cant zoom in on it This should be the required standard for all games I would actually pay more for this feature if thats what it would take I hear turning down the  watt setting really increases fps I really wish more games did this Now just tell me exactly how much each setting affects my FPS and youre golden Wish this was the standard Thats really nice Im going to have to use that as an example in a talk or something if I ever become famous arma  does this as your change the graphical settings the background changes as thats rendered by the game engine rather than just an image sitting there This is mind blowing I was really impressed when I saw those option menus during the beta The builtin benchmark was neat as well Too bad the game itself was a steaming pile of crap That resolution If only every game did this Sighs in sadness Let this become the new standard Someone plz halp I have a GTX A few weeks back the game ran at FPS at ultra settings Now i cant even get it to run on medium at more than fps Anyone has any idea what might have happened One day all games will have something so perfect Gonna be honest I did not know what Antisotropic filtering was and even looking it up I had no idea what it meant but this makes more sense than any mount of words will I havent seen something like this since Smash Bros Melee did this Anisotropic filtering needs a  BUMP Geforce experience tries to do something similar Doesnt exactly show you the difference between settings but it tells you what each setting does and gives examples Too bad its a Ubisoft downgrade Oh god that is fuckin beautiful Is there another game that does something like this or is this really the first game Also why cant they have a button to enable a small simulation of the load of the current settings on the system to give an estimated fps value on the settings page Wait Is that from ubisoft Seriously though This menu saved my gameplay Only good thing about this game Can we all take a minute to appreciate Can you take just a second to tell us which game it is What fucking game is this Yes but that game and ubisoft is garbage Can you show Ambient Occlusion I want to see if its actually worth the big performance hit Totalbiscuit has a stiffy right now Ubisoft attention to detail makes their games great Whoever had this idea  implemented it is a gamer themselves So handy This settings menu was about the only thing I enjoyed from this game Jesus thats a semi chub Every game needs this Veiled plug for the game I shall not mention Wish they put half the effort in making that menu into actually making the game Will Wildlands ever multiplayer like Rainbow  I know they talked about multiplayer but its hasnt been mentioned since Is this Clam Tomcy That is fucking glorious Apparently not Learn about us and

when a post reaches the top  of rall For those wondering what he thought of the experience He mentioned that the visuals and general immersion was incredible and it really looked like he was in the cockpit of the plane A couple of times he said he felt the feeling of vertigo as he started turning the plane His only gripe was the lack of feedback on the joystick On a real plane you can feel the wind and air resistance as you fly just like you can feel the road when you drive a car Without that resistance it was difficult for him to maneuver accurately This was probably most likely due to the incredibly cheap HOTAS setup we had for him I imagine theres more expensive options that could mirror the feeling reason why VR for old people might be more effective than younger ones A week later grandpa why are you talking in an Ugandan accent Stupid memes aside great to see him in the air again If his game allows it you might want to check leap motion so he can move buttons in VR space The women here seem to be unimpressed This warms my heart and is also only slightly cheaper than owning a plane The first picture looks almost like a stock image An old man getting to re live some of the best moments in his life thanks to technology That is a beautiful thing Thanks for sharing u better have got him a rudder pedal aswell bro Would love to see a video of him playing What game is that Ive been wanting a VR flight simulator that isnt Ultrawings All FlyInsideFSX does is crash I love how the women in the family dont give a fuck lol GODDAMN NIPS DIE DIE DIE and the entire room went awkward The future is amazing deleted The woman in the green shirt looks like she wants him to crash What was the total gift Was it just the VR setup or did you do a full PC build as well im guessing a build as well unless your grandpa was already a PC gamer with a beefy rig What are the build specs I finally set up vr with the Oculus and project cars  on my racing wheel seat setup The immersion is huge Never going back to regular racing I can only imagine how cool flying would be This is why technology is beautiful Why we should always push forward technologically and philanthropically Hey there my dad loves to fly But was too tall to join the Air Force I have recently come into a little bit of money and I have a good enough computer Would you be able to tell me all of the hardware and software needed to run this I would like to get it for him for his birthday I dont get why combat sims dont make a comeback in VR we need a new IL we need a new Silent Hunter VR we need new Janes flight sims we need Falcon  M Tank Plattoon III I miss  page manuals where you learn weapon systems and navigation The old days of PCMR You could beat grandpa at mario kart but hell wipe the floor with you in a mustang in war thunder go figure What was his opinion Did it fly similar to how he remembered my poppop had the same set up but he never felt like booting it up unless we did it for him He saw electric at  and television at  Computers are so beyond him Might as well use this post Tomb Raider httpswwwhumblebundlecomgiftkeyXwaRAXnmnhAv Sleeping Dogs only redeemable in Germany httpswwwhumblebundlecomgiftkeyDrUZRpbDfttyY May they bring you fun You can change the graphics settings so the TV shows a normal flat D full screen image Its better for onlookers The women in this picture look completely disinterested and the men are like wow thats killer Question For people that are actually pilots that also play flight simulators are you able to hop right in and fly in the game like you do a real plane or do you have to learn how to fly all over again I hope my kidsgrandkids do stuff like this for me when Im an old tired gamer who just cant find the energy to set up new tech I hope I never get like that but if I do hopefully the young bloods will help me out Edit Almost forgot to mention thats a really great thing you did for your Grandpa OP Cant wait to see the upcoming Shopped versions of what hes playing Everyone looks thrilled The girl in green looks like she bout to square up and knock some one tf out OP tell us your grandpas review Did he found it real Good Bad cmonBruh Edit OP did provide his grandpas review in the comments THIS is the use I originally got excited about VR headsets for To basically replace the monitor for sims What setup is this fucking grandpa wont pass the sticks Green Shirt Chick Make that man a flight sim setup Why is there  separate displays on that tv He thinks the flight sims are good he should wait til he sees the porn Warthunder Does it have VR now that girl on the sofa  give someone else a fuckin chance grampa  I have some people that I wish were still around to experience this The girls in that pic could give two shits about whats going on Id like to think you held the throttle in place for some hours War Thunder My dad has never been on a rollercoaster and decided he never wants to after trying one in VR and nearly falling face first into the coffee table THE FUTURE I can see him starting out flying all professional like hes used to doing then slowly realizing the potential of the system and doing all the shit he was never allowed to do while actually piloting a plane Barrel rolls people Im talking about barrel rolls And people said VR was pointless VR gave this man to relive his dream again Amazing This is awesome  You should repost on rflightsim The men look atleast interested haha None if those girls could give a shit if the picture is any indication lul I did this for my dad when I got an Oculus too The fu always does the trick D First girl on the left  Im watching Im watching Im watching  my phone He can also finally crash the plane just to see what its like What I hear you saying is we should start a kickstarter for him to get a plane Nice picture In the top pic I imagine the grandson is like Can I play now Grandpa Its been  hours NO sonny I have the high ground Look out Grandpa Kevin Spacey is behind you is that war thunder The girls in the back seem really into it VR is a waste of time VR is pointless no one will enjoy it Said the bandwagoners Good on yer gramps what did he say afterwords Did he enjoy it Everythings fun and games until grampa starts ing everything on sight great stOck image one the first one btw OMG That hits me right in the feels Thank you that just made my day My only problem is I cant give you a second upvote but take my uplifting comment and thanks instead The girl in the green shirt looks thrilled to be there I cannot in anyway ever upvote this enough thank you sir for your service He is flying Yes Like the old times Doh Good work team Now Elite Dangerous  Thats amazing Great to see people being nice again I know its a pic about your grandpa but look at that family it reminded of christmas or a morning chilly saturday get together especial with the dad holding the mug D hope u guys continue having a good one This smells like a meme Man I just bought a VR system Vive and I have to say its WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than I thought it would be I was expecting something like the D craze but the VR is actually fun and while it is a bit straining on the eyes it doesnt make me physically ill like D When I show my parents Google VR Earth they are literally going to have heart attacks Which is fine with me since I am an only child and get everything  Howd he say Warthunder handeled compared to real planes i know he probably has never flown a ww fighter but still did he say it was realistic Actually one of the most coherent and impressive builds Ive seen in a while Amazing Its a formula for a reasonhttpsiredditnpnxpaivjpg Good job Your currant build is spicy Sorry Love the details like the space for the

plays with xboxps controllers on games that run better on console tried to tell him part of the reason pc is good is because keyboard and mouse is better but just doesnt listen never seen him try and

very nice Nice firewatch wallpaper I have the same one You got my upvote twice you whore Take it do you have anything that isnt fruitbased You really like RD How do you split the wallpaper like that

poor and could only afford this Kidding aside looks nice I like the simple colors of the whole look White with orange bits is right up my alley Im more of a raisin setup kinda guy so satisfying and clean Kids pranking each other in the computer lab by removing each others mouse balls haha If you were there then you never will forget the new found precision after cleaning your mouse Those little wheels would catch so much lint from the mouse pad Oh gawd I remember getting my first laser mouse and it feeling so strange Do not cite the deep magic to me I was there when it was written These were always nasty at school horrible my disappointment when I found out they werent bouncy When you slightly lift the mouse off the mousepad and it fucks up where your cursor is Who else did this almost daily to get that extra accuracy in online FPSs I washed the shit out of my balls Kids these days will never know the struggle of keeping their balls clean mouse balls always remind me of a hard boiled egg yolk th grade Computer Class  Teacher leaves for some reason Autistic David goes around taking everyones mouse balls We all just let him to see where this is going He stores the  mouse balls in his shirt like a kangaroo He leaves the room Teacher comes in Okay lets start class David took our mouse balls and left so we cant click What David took every single one of our mouse balls in his shirt like a kangaroo and now we cant click Teacher runs out yelling David David comes back in while teacher is gone Without mouse balls Teacher comes back in David where are the mouse balls No answer Teacher intercoms principles office David took all of the mouse balls somewhere Mouse balls For computers David are you there Where are the computer mouse balls Toilet Is the plural of computer mouse computer mice or computer mouses My  year old coworker today quite literally asked cant you increase the tension of your mouse if you dont want it to move around so much Or do you have to get a mouse with a ball that doesnt roll so easily I laughed so hard And felt so bad Hes great We called each other names most of the day Anyone else bothered by the dry QTip being used to clean the rollers The crud usually had to be scraped off of them a QTip would just come apart Keep your balls clean people I had the original Razer Boomslang dpi on a ball mouse It was godlike and I rekt house in Quake But then again cleaning it was a real shitshow I thought I was looking at a episode of the screen savers on tech tv here It might be even XD bruh literally every kid knows what these are I currently use a trackball and still have to clean the ball socket and contact points even though the ball movements are read by optical sensor The cleaning is worth it for a superior input device Whats this playstation  connector you speak of Aaaah the first job for any IT support newbie Still not as bad as dial up internet Even though I wasnt in that generation for a while I had a ps mouse with a track ball God that thing was nasty By cleaning their mouse ball Im  and know and used these mice And let me tell you I hated them I feel old And Im just  Nooooo Dont clean it too good Then it spins too much Its gotta have a little friction so you can make those headshots without zooming in Call me crazy but I loved these mice for FPS games The flick was amazing with these mice Get enough speed slight raise the mouse and youd get a perfect  I know Ill hear how much better todays mice are and all but i loved that mechanical feel Mouse balls jokes on you my school still had these mice before they upgraded everything People always LeBron the ball mice but no one ever mentions the first gen optical mice We had one in the early s and it only works with a special mouse pad which I think has tiny gridlines on it and that was the only way the primitive sensor on the mouse can track movement It worked okay at best and I could see why ball mice dominated for  years until the modern optical sensors finally got good enough to take over will confirm he was there  years ago Remember those Velcro balls you could put in your mouse to clean them deleted I used to take the those off and hide it somewhere so that my brother and sister dont mess with my WoW account back then i sucked at remembering passwords so i ended up with very simple combinations like Qwe etc this would keep them busy until im back from school Good times good times Who washed their balls Yeahyou heard me I miss scraping clean the rollers That was so satisfying When big chunks would come off So many times Id sit down at someones desk and the mouse felt like it was rolling over gravel Id open up the mouse grab a paperclip and pry the dust deposits off the little white rollers Was always amazed how many people didnt do this and just dealt with crappy mouse response I had the OG boomslang and it had some brushes that would prevent it from getting too dirty Also remember modifying the refresh rate max on the ps port in windows  Gotta get dat precision I was very young when I last used a ball mouse It was on my grandparents Gateway PC and I played the hell out of Tonka Construction I kind of want one again for shits and giggles Is it still possible to get them Surely some Chinese factory somewhere still has some obscure stash of them that time when old people already considered you as a genius geek when you clean that ball Im almost  and i remember the ball mousethey always got clogged until i got a laser mouse and just never returned Im the new generation and I remember this being my first mouse Ah the old PCs with mb of RAM Over at rmousereview they would tell you to trade the ball for a marble and save  grams I still do this every few weeks Ergo MX I played Halo CE as a kiddie with one of these bad boys Good times lol i still have one just doesnt work Oh god I forgot all about this When I was in rd or th grade I used to think the tightly wound up rope of hair and dust wrapped around the ball was supposed to be there Literally made a perfect line down the middle in our case I used to play with that ball Oof When I first started gaming on a computer I used a ball track mouse for a week before I bought a cheap laser mouse Just the other week I was thinking about how much I dont miss this Also how RealPlayer can stay in hell where it belongs Your telling me I could clean take that ball out the whole time Still have these kind at my school My kindergarden had one and my god did they never clean it and it was so haed to move Middle generation who has experienced everything laughs Trackball mice were very slow to control i remember stealing every mouse ball in the library Sad fact is we only just lost our one while moving houses I think I had that exact mouse Memories I still do this with my M I remember those mouses and I hate them now When ever the teacher made me mad I would take them out of the mice and take them home funny enough I never got caught lol When I was in secondary school me and a friend hid all the little tracker balls that go in the mice from the library It was our senior prank Because of that in the middle of th period the principal went on the intercom and said whoever stole the mouse balls from the library please return them immediately I think the entire school exploded after that Omfg I forgot about these Its been so many years since I had a track ball mouse Thanks for sharing i cleaned dem rollers so many times i had no idea about the ball tho i would be worried cleaning the ball would fuck with traction Those things were hard One kid got mad at another in the computer lab when I was a kid so he took the ball out of the hockey puck iMac mouse he was using and pelted the other kid with it Left a nice welt I used to use a mouse like this never cleaned the ball tho I remember these little roombas sucking up all the dirt dust and whatever else comes in their way Well the ball was a good office toy I remember in one of my science classes in Middle school some kid kept stealing these for unknown reasons Our teacher took all of them out of the mice and you had to sign a sheet to take one and use a mouse It was bad Im considered gen Z early but when I was little we still had some of these bad boys lying around I loved them Dont quote the deep magic to me witch I was there when it was written It sounds douchey but when I was a kid I used to steal these from the computer lab and play with them I never once saw anyone clean them that way It was always with a fingernail and just rubbing the ball between your fingers I made it a habit to clean every mouse at school I came across before using it Those mechanical mice were a pain in the ass kids these days dont know how easy they have it Now lets shock youIm still there I was born on  and had a chance to play on a ball mouse for years playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City and some website games I play with the ball in the mouse everytime my PC freezes or is loading BASKETBALL I still have the mouse being kept for future memories Honestly when I was a kid I used to always think that those balls were bouncy balls so time after time I would try to bounce it never bounced  Kids pranking each other in the computer lab by removing each others balls haha Logitech Ballspeed Technology Got some hair on your ball My dad had one of the ones where the ball was a scroller I remember accidentally eating and choking on this when I was little Even with the dirt I miss my Microsoft Mouse  The Microsoft Intellimouse A was my first optical Mouse With the renewed Intellimouse maybe I would give a try not always a Gaming Mouse is the answer when you ask for a pointing device I just bought a wireless mouse brand new in the package from  I have never seen a wireless ball mouse before How did records and typewriters get brought back as hipster things but not rollerball mice Never used one of these but its obvious what they do I was there too but i never did that wtf I still remember my first laser mouse Nothing like the super smooth glide compared to a ball mouse My buddy went threw like three generations of MS inteli mouse he like the first one so much Is this where the pee is stored I understand because when I was little my parents used to have a mouse like that  so I understand I still have one of those I found one of those at work and it goes well with the s laptop that was with it Found thishttpswwwsnopescomfactcheckmouseballs ins some IBM docs My friend but expelled for cutting the balls in the lab I think im considered a part of the new generation being born in  but I still understand the struggle because my old school had trackball mice and they never worked Just absolutely never Are you  dude Dont make posts like this unless youre actually old The new gen is you CAST IT INTO THE FIRE Hehe its legend Jokes on you I watch old tech videos because Im doing nothing better with my life  Yo I still use one today Its on my desk rn in  years mechanical mice are going to be the next biggest thing Actually do anyone know those trackball mouses recently released by Logitech They got a sensor plus a trackball so two ways to control the mouse Do you still need to clean the trackball or not like this post  I did alot of Scraping of human salsa off the rollers in the computer lab I couldnt stand using a jumpy mouse Makes my stomach curl just knowing what I do now I remember one time we took the ball out of my friends computer when he was out of the room and told him the computer froze funny af when we showed him after Me and my brother threw this to each other until my dad stuck it with it glue so we dont remove it but then it didnt work anymore I still use one of those Every Fucking Day God this used to piss me off so much When u so broke u had to use a ball mouse in  Oh I dont miss those I never knew those things could be opened let alone be cleaned RELEASE THE FORBIDDEN GOBSTOPPER Dont miss that Satisfying though When you had to carefully clean your balls or watch your mouse go on an adventure Give your mouse balls a tug shorsey This is one of the reasons why mice now use lasers Holy nostalgia batman When I started my job three months ago I went to IT and asked for a mouse since I didnt get one They gave me a fucking ball mouse The thing was awful I actually completely forgot about this shame on me There was always that string of gunk on the wheels inside that was so satisfying to remove I loved pissing in the mice so people would touch them and then have smelly hands Im Gen X and I get this I think everyone knows what a mouse ball is But yeah my first pc didnt have a laser mouse and I didnt know to keep it clean lol i kinda enjoyed cleaning the mouse but not when it stopped working because it was dirty  I might argue that what SSD has done for a modern computer in terms of a musthave upgrade moving to a laser mouse was the equivalent Cheap enough and made such an improvement to your PC experience This was true hell You were supposed to clean those still have to do the same thing with my track ball mouse in  To everyone who hasnt seen it behold The IBM mouse balls memohttpswwwneystadtorgjohnhumorIBMMouseBallshtm Im very glad ball mice are no longer a thing lol I remember the time used to love playing with mouse balls so much its kinda addicting and satisfying for me It would glide like a salmon after cleaning Gotta wash your balls Stop making me feel old you bastards We had a giant mouse with the four corners of a square are buttons and a big ball in the middle I have one of these but i nerver used it httpschurchillnextimgixnetimagescasestudiesimagesMicrosoftMouseDjpgautoformatdprfitmaxhw By far the best balled mouse Replaced as my favorite mouse by the Intellimouse explorer and finally by the Logitech mx which Ive recorded four times P I looked like the inside of a hard boiled egg SO I CUT IT IN HALF Deep magic witch dont there I was cite Getting a big solid roller goober was super satisfying though Yo I totally remember this in the s lolz it was the next best thing until they used laser to track where the mouse was moving Nothing quite like the feeling of a freshly washed mouse ball I still prefer these Ah the good ol days where people still said world wide web and wazzzaaaaaaap Good times We still use these on certain computers at work Really brings me back I used to love scratching off those lines of dirt from the wheels roddlysatisfying That glide you got with a freshly cleaned mouse ball was euphoric Nothing better then a session after a freshly washed mouse ball The other thing that this reminded me of Remember how terrible the early optical mice were And they felt light and cheap Compared to a good heavy mouse ball LeTs CoNfUsE tHe NeW gEn Poptropica Im  and Im old enough to remember this lol Hey mom mouse isnt moving again The many attempts the school implemented to prevent students from removing them always failedbut man did they roll good what the ball for lol I know I am old Man I hated those The ones at my school were always fucked up and needed cleaning I used to use a trackball last year because I found one and my mouse was broken  I think I played with the ball to much and list it lol you think the school got new mice since then Im from the New generation Only stopped using such a mouse about a year and a half ago never forget the balls I used to think the rollers inside the mouse had little wires wrapped around them Then one day as I was cleaning it one broke off I thought I had broken the mouse Nope It was just lint packed so hard together that it had wrapped itself into a tight circle around the roller Grossssss The feels when your countrys IT books still teaches how to use these even though nobody has them anymore It was openable for cleaning Huh Ball mice arent that obsolete and foreign to youthare they Those ball gets really dirty in a short time of usage i never had to experience this but cleaning the ball and the movey aroundy area and then using the mouse again mustve been the absolute best feeling ever I want one That ball was so heavy Dont forget kids wash your balls regularly for optimal performance I would regularly pop mine open every few days and scrape that shizz with my fingernail Just another fact of life back in the golden age of PC gaming I know what this is but I wasnt there Im a s kid My first mouse was laser I hope to one day be called a hell of a hostage uSrGrafo please we need more time We are trying to get what you

aspects My own gaming buddy at work is constantly giving me crap anytime I bring up building a PC and talking to him about hurdlestriumphs Hes always trying to find any way he can to put it down meanwhile Im just like Cant I just enjoy this and send you some excited updates on my PC build progress to you as a fellow techenthusiast Not to mention I still have my  consoles why is it such a bad thing I am doing something he isnt We shouldnt start gloating yet Who knows how optimized it will be for PCs Could be as good as GTA or as bad as Arkham Knight Console ports are always a crap shoot And look at all the problems they had when The MCC launched on console several people are typing    They wouldnt let it go down like that The Halo series is too precious to everyone for it to be just another port Its always been wrong Console emulators are always just a matter of time ragedlikemilk They will never play halo Halo on steam Cereal guy The future is now old man So this guy never heard of emulators Aged better then an antivax kid Nice try buddy This man should be burned at the stake for his sins against us i almost feel sorry for that guy Ahhhhhh come on whyd you blur his name I hope the God War guy gets his shit too They did an oopsies Like white wine it filled with bits of cork and became vinegar Tbh the PC will still miss the golden age of Halo gaming though recent events really are amazing Like emulators never existed Anyone who boasted that exclusivity Suck my fucking balls Ima be all up in the Chief like i care what some xbox player has to say lol Link Would be nice to be able to comment on the video E M U L A T I O N Pff Im on xbox and even I know that the PC is far superior especially with the MCC coming to PC along with Halo Infinite I mean we could play Halo  and  decades ago and thats really all you ever needed cries in hz IPS GSync It only aged  years Nothing ages well in  years Laughs in emulator Im so petty that I have to justify my few hundred dollar purchase by denying millions fun I dont get console warriors Wouldnt you like your series to sell well and on as many platforms as possible More people will talk about it online and you will likely get future things from the company who made it due to them having additional fundsinterest in their product Games should be for everybody Im glad barriers are starting to come down Ooh we showed him  years later but BOI Is he wrong GOTCHA BITCHhttpsyoutubehADLHNXJaIt That was bullshit even at the time See now I am excited to play this on my PC as well but circlejerking over such thing is the reason why we cant have nice things just edit the comment and put properly at the end I remember when Halo  and  came out for PC and they were completely unoptimized dumpster fires bringing a fucking Geforce  ti to its knees Itll always just cost a wee bit tho The funny thing was that the Xbox  couldnt really play it for some time either lol It was wrong to begin with emulation exists Obviously this particular comment didnt age too well diggle Ps players will never play Total War seriesWoW Starcraft or countless other games Oh and never gonna experience mods so everyone loses emulated versions allow me to introduce myself curb your enthusiasm theme plays even if it didnt come to pc officially im sure theres emulators You could have used John Diggle and you didnt Shameful He makes it sound like God himself created the MCC to solely run on Xbox laughs in widescreen Cue the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme hmmhttpsknowyourmemecommemesthatswhereyourewrongkiddofull Oof Oh reading comments like these is practically sexual in its pleasure DID YOU GUYS ENJOY BETA TESTING THE GAME FOR US AND PAYING FOR IT Very literal in this situation too I think I slept from the early s until  because I dont remember all the fuzz about Halo when it first came out But now Im awake and I will be able to play it so everythings fine Thats a fat L As a halo junkie I had several pc friends mock halo and now theyre excited to play it Halo  soundtrack in the distance Why is halo so important can someone explain I checked some gameplay and it looks old MCC was announced just in time Xenia Xbox  Emulator is starting to look pretty playable emulating Halo games httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaAZabdQ and lets not forget ElDewrito  If they had waited much longer with MCC for PC there would have been no more need for it we would have done it ourself winks at Red Dead Redemption Remember when the meme use to be but can it run Crysis Ahhhh the good ol days Imagine if this is a huge April fools joke I would have to try to not kill myself hahaha Loooooooooooool Ill enjoy playing this in k at actual max settings with HDR and all the goodies Thanks console beta testers rpostthatagedwell Fuck that guy The only thing I can think of right now is Pepega With reach When is it coming out steam barges in looking pissed ahem steam bolsters its download of MCC Does mcc have online coop for the campaigns Does anyone know That comment was made to not age well we will get it one way or the other if we need to run the game with an emulator or if Microsoft released it on pc Werent xbox games already available on PC through the game store Like quantum break Ive never been so wet before I grew up a console kid played the shit out of every game between Halo    when the series took a turn for the worse I played Halo CE first on PC and it was superior As this port will be Well clearly this didint age very well Fov slider and uncapped frames we will be good Bonus if the game runs as well as a csgobefore the updated textures or a r siege with low settings hz masterrace As tradition says Thanks for betatest consoles Show the name so we can shame him Finally something to end my CSGO misery And nothing of value wouldve been lost I guess Bet Where is this comment PM me xB EDIT Nv found it not linking Gloating about which exclusive video games your DRM package of choice gives you access to is probably the lamest shit I can imagine Yeah as good as Halo is there are many many better games and some are exclusive to PCMR Where the hell do you find YouTube comments from  years ago Yt video What was the point of redacting the users name  years Man Im stoked for PC to get Halo Want the Switch the get it too Everyone should play this game its fucking amazing But there is always optimization or lack thereof and the time we had to wait before we could actually play it MCC being announced for PC has really lit a fire under my ass to finish my first build All I need now is a CPU a monitor and a desk MUAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA There are those who said this day would never come What are they to say now Oh snap  rwoooosh Or a really really stupid person Fair warning though MCC ran like the biggest sack of shit when it launch on xbox so heres hoping its not like that on PC do we know if it will be crossplay with xbox Oof How Quickly the tide turns Error irrelevantdll file not found Installation will now terminate uh pretend to look busy while I figure out what to do for this last  steam updates be like  minutes remaining  minutes remaining  minutes remaining installing  hours

comics If you like to see more comics please consider following me xB Twitter httpstwittercomSystemComicshttpstwittercomSystemComics Instagram httpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomicshttpswwwinstagramcomsystemcomics Facebook httpswwwfacebookcomSystemComicshttpswwwfacebookcomSystemComics My guess for the time imbalances installation percentage is based on the amount of functions left rather than time remaining and certain functions require more time especially the last one laughs in aptget install When you finish your task in mins but you send it at the end of the day to make it seem like you did a whole day of work at work Me when I try looking for the last objective to end the mission Hey let the poor guy enjoy his creation before he closes and officially finishes up Imagine spending time doing something and not being able to enjoy the outcome of all your hard work Imagine building a pc for example and never be able to stare at the lights and the hardware as you boot it up for the first time Point is let the being enjoy what he made You can wait one more minute for the sake of happiness TLDR shit got deep way to fucking fast rollback phase has started Rollback phase complete Install was unsuccessful Install time  h m Laughs in pacman S Laughs in Linux xB Now excuse me while I fix my video drivers That program and the way its assembled is giving me a strong Space Station  vibe for some reason My favorite installation was Microsoft Visual Studio sometime around  It started out smoothly and the Estimated Time was something like  minutes OK cool thats not a surprise Then the time started to go up  minutes  minutes  minutes etc etc Finally it got to the midway point and there was about an hour and a half remaining and it finally started counting down I appreciate that they were trying to give me some kind of an estimate and I completely understand that those estimates can be very difficult But if its that hard to get it right youre better off just not bothering At least at  you can cancel if you think the install program has hung up and try again I hate when this happens with a Windows update A few times Ive gone away and come back and hour or more later with the same screen being displayedhttpbucarotechelpcomcomputerswinmaintimagesupdatescrnjpg What do you do Take a chance youll bork your OS by hitting the reset button or just continue to wait perfectly programmed Your computer must now restart Please close your  browser tabs and save and close your  open documents Then get some coffee going By planting some coffee beans You kids today never knew the sheer confusion when downloading something in the s It would start out reasonable  minutes then jump to  hours then back to  minutes then to  years then to  minutes etc Never knew when the fuck it was going to finish At least at  you can cancel if you think the install program has hung up and try again I hate when this happens with a Windows update A few times Ive gone away and come back and hour or more later What do you do So much THIS Its a computer that can do billions of calculations per second what the hell is it doing Its supposed to do the work of a million humans in the blink of an eye Also works for  and is even more infuriating It was literally just a meme and now yall are in like a full on debate Files remaining

you Project Managers Then Error  Please try again later At  the PC does the equivalent of stashing away the tools it used to build the program throwing away any remnants and cleaning the table Just Windows things No no no The last frame should say Finishing install  This May take  times longer than the actual install which showed the progress bar OP needs an SSD If they had this little computer guys face shown while doing updates I couldnt be mad at it its just too cute Havent seen this shit since I switched to linux Hes so happy though He tried I just bought ESO Its  fucking GB Guess Ill play tomorrow Not a problem on Linux This is exactly how my computer installs windows updates This is exactly what I have in mind when this shit happens Its almost like the system is looking for its last puzzle piece but cant find it close the last flap One of the applications I support is notorious for this During installation it stalls at  remaining for a few minutes then jumps back up to  as it starts the second phase of the installation Can anyone explain to an idiot like me why this is Lol the room even got darker Why do some programs get stuck like that At least its a program Imagine if it was Windows Whats even worse is when it reaches  but just stays there for an indefinite amount of time before finally installing Does anyone actually know why this happens Should the bar not represent the percentage of time remaining Not the percentage of the process completed Motherfucking Oracle and IBM softwares are the biggest culprits I see this from Especially IBM shit This is why I chose this username I love how content he is during the entire process Me Today With the fucking fedex software There should be two more slides with it at  Anyone out there know why when something installs it always hangs out around  or  for an extra bit I had that today at work when I installed Google Chrome on the work computer installation was stuck at  seconds remaining for  minutes until I decided to cancel the installation Does it count I thought this was an office installation tutorial Computer gets paid by the hour For humans the first  would be procrastinating and the last  they would be frantically assembling As someone who has built dummy progress bars himself from time to time Im convinced that like  of progress bars are in fact dummy bars Easy mode is the Zenos paradox solution the bar just slows down as time elapses so it never reaches  until the task completes Moderate mode incorporates a random element to make it jump around a little bit but still never reach  until completion Estimated time remaining can be a lie too Doesnt matter Even Apple gets this wrong  regardless how you feel about them as a whole theyre the top dog in UX and they still dont get this right Rendering a Gb video be like sorry installed fail please try again i think they do this on purpose to make the wait feel less painful and the percentages dont actually mean anything Thats Netflix for me PlayStation be like Dont forget when it also pauses at  insert CD  Move the mouse moron We all know shit goes faster if you move the mouse On OS X you dont install Just copy the app into the apps folder Unix is far superior Steam recently  Second until installation complete Eta suddenly goes up its like  seconds then more install failed redownloading gb My computer when I was trying to install PrimeOS Uh oh I used to put my finger on the screen as a guide because I thought that the damn bar didnt move Its been a long time since Ive programmed but its quite funny that the last few percent of installs can actually be figuratively told as closing the box Deleting temp files telling the installer to wrap it up creating user interface finition icons and config items Hes waiting for the  to do something Gonna be a long time Windows updates be like This program needs to download additional files from the internet to finish installing Click Yes to proceed Clicks Yes The files could not be downloaded Installation aborted The only solution to this problem is a bar that moves at an even pace and just goes back to zero when it fills up Basically the widows hourglass Hes so cute Just drop the icon in the folder whats the big deal And then it finally hits  but its still not done Just delete system  duh   Normally for me  of the time is the first  then it jumps to  That happyblank stare just works so well here where does the wizard come into this Adobe flash player needs an update those bars stated progress are arbitrary and completely up to the developer it could be doing most of the work while saying  done and usually is so this comic isnt really accurate Sure that may be the case Its only when it goes from  to  is when the real frustration emerges I hate when chrome finishes the download but it DOESNT LET YOU DO CRAP WITH THE FILE Is that a bomb Me working on an easy project at work with a long timeline Format C Return Me trying to nut on mdma Burst a

BACK  STUCK UNTIL HEAT DEATH OF UNIVERSE Gives up after an hour of waiting clicks on X to close the installer  installer closes and installation is cancelled That hurt me in my soul Memes aside does anyone know why this actually happens Has to take a beer break before actually finishing the job If they add a decimal then oh boy Dont smile at me like that you son of a bitch I dont get it The third and fourth panels are just deadeye staring into my soul for some reason It used to be like that on dial up but now I got verizon fios fiber optic internet or whatever Its like I know why programs seem

could not install because it couldnt install I like to think my computer is really proud of itself for installing something and takes a second to admire its work Haha thats so true I once had a steam game that said it would take seven years to download it was at  And failure then shutting down That  screwing us over like always And keep installing until the next day This was somewhat my experience installing Windows updates on my Surface Pro About twenty minutes to reach  The rest of the night to hit  What is it building A bomb Mine always stayed at  for a long time Classic That face made me chuckle This usually happens because of how progress is measured In most installers the longest part of the progress is taken by copying files which is generally a pretty predictable operation The last operation is typically to update some values in the registry to setup some firewall rules to update some configuration which could take longer than expected Smack down Bring the Pain always did this on start up when loading save data  in  seconds then  seconds waiting This is like finishing Building your new custom pc and the dreaded final step Booting everything Hoping to all that is good n holy that it will fire up and boot Its as if time stops Even worse when the meter says  for any visible amount of time surely by the time  is done the progress bar should have gone away Task manager is not responding intensifies Ive had to straight up just download a single windows dll file that wasnt there for some reason and i had to go put it in system folder I finally got a better motherboard yesterday It took me like  hours to just install it and then troubleshoot It was my first time changing a motherboard but some work still remains  like getting windows to the new SSD and configuring RAM speeds so I get the best performance Downloading GTA  on PC  Long Days Later  Downloaded FATAL ERROR RETRY AGAIN LATER Man I hate this Why cant they just tell us what the hell is going on in the background Instead we get this ambiguous bar and percentage Sometimes it stuck at around  or somewhere for a really long time and then zoom within just a second to  So what the hell did the other  was doing anyway taking so long and what the hell the other was doing so fast And then since they didnt tell us what the hell were they doing during installation well find out later that the program files ended up in multiple places despite during the initial setup they said that they will install it in this certain directory that we had chosen And here comes the worst part when came time we need to uninstall they did not remove everything that they installed making us finding third party uninstaller like Revo to finish the job Even that didnt finish the job Nice job Lol that webtoon notification Error missing dll application not installed edit the last panel and make it go to  I dont get it Me trying to present something that is not finished Youre pirating a game and then you start getting worried that the link wasnt safe but it already finished and now youre panicking about how your PC might have malware And when the checks come up saying your PC is fine youre still worried cause Google chrome took an extra  seconds to start up and battlefield  runs at  fps and not  My torrents do that all the time Its super annoying On windows maybe Fucking windows deleted Our son is so good at technology I was literally laying down under my desk plugging in USB cables and my mom said you look so professional doing that Edit Yall dirty minded freaks She was talking about how I was working with my computer Edit  I hate how this is my top upvoted comment Edit  Thanks whoever blessed me with my first silver Also no I was laying down under my desk I wasnt ass up or anything like that Just Laying Down My family calls me Lights and Sounds guy Apperently Im the only one that knows about the Input button on TV remotes Come on people stop trying to put your damn TV on channel  to watch a blueray or cable A quote from my ex Omg shut up is that a pc on your tv Get called into my office because screen does not work xB walk in turn it on pushing the button xB Lady managers face turns red xB Dont worry I wont tell Im lucky my dads hobby is building computers and he deals with his own issues When he calls me seeking advice then I know its a bigger issue Meanwhile my family ask me to fix broken TVs and cars and get disappointed that I cant What kind of an engineer are you Ane here I am plugging USBs into the HDMI on my laptop Plugging in a USB on the first try xB My family No way hes magic xB Me No way magic And wait to see how I connect the Mini DisplayPort out to the HDMI in  When the plug is all the way in the back It aint much but the TV works When a family memeber says that I just say No Im not its just pushing buttons reading menu or just pluging this thingy to that other thingy that looks the same as the first thingy and it just gets quite I ask my mom why I have to plug in the fire stick every time Youre the best at it This is a selffulfilling prophecy though most kids start with this sort of stuff Then they graduate to fixing the wifi Then the printer And before they know it they are managing linux servers and coding shit The next line is you should go into an IT job you know theres good money in it Most of your friends family and even coworkers call you at odd hours for help on stupid technology shit and sometimes it gets really annoying but you do it anyway Its a curse but we are ready to bear it When it actually takes that much effort because the tv is inside a cabinet and you have to reach around and blindly search for the port I remember when I was  plugging the tower into the wall then plugging in the KBM then the monitor into the tower and my mom jaw hitting the floor She told all her friends about it for weeks how great I was with computers Should say My Teacher Plugs into HDMI on motherboard instead of GPU I got this recently at a family cookout One of my brothers friends wanted the password for our wifi I told it to him he still couldnt get in he hands his phone to me I type in the password and it works Cue my entire family acting like Im a fucking tech genius literally all I did was type in the wifi password I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and am halfway to a Masters Degree But if anyone in my extended family asks if Im good with computers I tell them no I will never understand how people can have a hard time hooking up any consumergrade computer or AV equipment in  The plug likely only fits in one socket and only one way If there are more than one socket where it fits color match them and youll probably be right If they arent color coded you can probably plug it into any of them I dont understand why thats so hard for some people It can really be a curse in a way Ive ended up the family computer repair man and of course they tell everyone how much of a wizz kid I am when really I can just do fairly basic repairs and anything more complicated requires hours of googling and tutorials This would be fine if people valued these things like most other trades but alot of people who have no knowledge of computers seem to think that you just click your fingers and its fixed I dont mind so much with family but with friends of family it becomes an underpaid chore So true I get asked to plug in the HDMI from the PS to the TV all the time So I always say take it out and plug it in the TV Its a pain having to go from my room to plug in a cable They called me a hacker in my class I dont know shit about computers Im just the only one who thinks of switching the off and on again when theres a problem This reminds me of the time i got the ps As the time my house do not have wifi yet so no ethernet all i have to do is the power cable and the hdmi and my family just shocks Can you help fix the TV The TV in my house is wall mounted and out of the  HDMI port only  is accessible from the side so I have to constantly remove and plug in between the Nintendo switch firetv stick and satellite TV for my family am i the only here thats going to comment on chris hemsworth thumbs You ever think our parents just pity us sometimes and ask for our help to connect That hit me harder then it should have Me  yeah just buy an usb to hdmi cable and then you can mirror your laptop to your tv FIL wow are you a sorcerer It should just be me plugging the hdmi cable into the hdmi port dont know why they added an extra in Its so annoying and it boggles my mind to see actual adults just immediately give up trying to learn the very basics of technology because its confusing Goddamn I need this movie to come out on video so I can watch it and miss all the spoilers Its becoming so flagrant to post pics from it White is HDMI Blue is DIV Im not tech in any sense and all I know is fixing my own problems using youtube but Im always the resident tech expert Green cable goes in green hole Squary cable goes in squary hole I recently setup a smart TV to have wifi internet so that my family can watch netflix without any plugins My mom said its nice to have a computer science major in the house P How my whole friends and family see me especially after getting a triple monitor setup I literally just plugged in another monitor but Ill ride the clout for now When they say Our sons so good with tech one day but Youre wasting your life on that computer the next Is no one going to point out how incredibly tech smart Rocket actually is To be fair I did fix my moms printer last month by unplugging the usb cable from the ethernet port and plugging it into a usb port Im einstein The title reminded me of Jonah Hills character Snorri from the show Maniac on Netflix Why do old people refuse to learn My sister always makes me set up her Xbox every time she moves it from our house to our grandparents I drove  hours down to my mums house to put a screen protector on her phone As a young man in the networking field can confirm my family thinks Im so wizard Had a guy ask me if the hdmi cable to his projector would work on a modern tv Then if it would transfer K signal that I wasnt completely sure but cables are cheap its easy to find out This but with handy house things I help my mom set up her smart phone She helps me change oil and hang picture frames  Its a good system I went to visit family across the country recently and they had a whole list of things that needed fixing They told me the TV didnt work so I had to plug in the HDMI cable and change the input to the Roku box so they could get to Netflix My aunt made me a huge fancy dinner in appreciation and I didnt hate it My mum legitimately doesnt know how to move stuff from one USB to another Im very good with working with computers Thanks Toms Hardware TV is on the wrong input so I press the source button My family I dont know how you figure these things out so quickly Youre like some sort or computer wizard I love that its my Joband I get paid very well for jt I treat them like end users I will walk them thru it If they dont care to listen then I wont care to tell  My brother asked me to fix his internet so I just plugged his WiFi adapter into his laptop and connected it to the router ahahahah my family cant even scroll pages They always say I bet itll work now when you get summoned to look at an issue  of the people I know of dont bother to look at the direction of the USB TypeA connector both male and female side before plugging it in Unfortunately most of them cant plug it in on the st try In my own head Squareish peg goes into squareish hole You meme but my mom didnt even know she could hook her laptop up to her TV with HDMI until I hooked mine up to watch shows on her TV Honey the internet isnt working turns the router off and back on wow thanks Me when I open a video on the TV using YouTube on my phone Oof Very relatable Same bro IT Have you tried turning it off and on again I once used my tv as a second display to watch video from my laptop there note my tv is an older one so it doesnt support youtube netflix ect All I did was to unplug the tvs HDMI and plugged it to my laptops HMDI port and their reaction is best to describe as overreacting Althrough I was not a tech expert of any kind I knew some of the simplest things about tech and my family always saw me as some kind of tech expert lol But because of that when someone in the house needs help with anything related to tech even minor ones theyd always call me Its not very pleasant when youre called by your dad because he couldnt find that one app from the home screen just because he accidentally removed it from the home screen and youll have to teach him how to swipe up in Android  to open the app screen Sometimes its kinda frustrating I thought that this meme is about plugging the hdmi cable at the risk of electrocuting yourself but after seeing the comments now I know that I may have been the only one to experience that Literally me every day because I fix all the the probables in my house lol even though they are super simple fixes Hackerman To be fair to the family its entirely possible that their tech skills do not include plugging things in correctly When my brother makes me mad i just switch the hdmi output to input on his xbox and he has absolutely no chance of fixing it on his own I also have family that calls to confirm i got emails Yesterday I was plugging in my new keyboard to the back of my PC and my grandma was blown away by it my sons a computer genius he can turn on the computer and download malware all by himself The only HDMI port Just wait till they a DP port and break that HDMI lmao I pretend I dont know what I am doing with computers so my coworkers dont bug me with computer advice I once helped my grandma by taking out the memory card on her phone and putting it into my tablet and showing her the photos on there She now thinks Im some world class hacker Holy grail My boss once got a security camera system installed but he didnt have a monitor for it So he bought a raspberry pi to watch the store he came up to me and was like Ive heard you are into electronics I cant seem to get this dang raspberry pi working Ive worked with raspi before so I tell him I could take a look at it but no promises I go to the room where the cameras plug in I see an LCD screen that has little raspberry pi mounting holds I plug it into the wall I plug the hdmi in and the screen turns on Not only did my boss not know how to hook up hdmi and power he also kept calling this monitor a raspberry pi YoU sHoUlD lEArn PrOGraMMInG Can you help your brother fill out job applications online Youre good at computers Sometimes i weep for the human race I was made for this Man you should be going to MIT or something Oh wow I never new you had to press the power button I cant imagine what it must be like to be those people Maybe when Im  my children will come over and install my quantum entangled mental router and be all like Dad alls you gotta do is flim flam the jinga jam The monitors at work have DP in and a DP out The number of people who get new monitors and claim theyre broken is quite annoying It should be that teacher in first grade Until they plug it into the motherboard instead of the GPU Every Damn Sunday Dinner I thought you were talking about reaching behind the TV Why didnt they let Thor wear it He has cosmic powers My job has a seriously large scopeyou can love it or hate itI just smile and tell myselfyoure getting way over paid to do the task you are about to do someone completely insist I go to their desk or drive out to one of our  other sitesI just get very annoyed that people complaing about waiting for  days or something rediculousand its a vga cable xB meanwhile I am trying to deploy  iphones make sure they are securely setup through MDM softwarewith the icloud sign in portion blocked on our network and figure out how in the fuck going to make some bullshit app work that they bought from a vendor and didnt tell anyone aboutend rant I swear older people hate to learn new things Like a lot of this technology is pretty basic stuff if you can just remember I shouldnt have to explain to my mom why the tv is broken every time I switch inputs and forget to switch it back lol this is  true Hey this was actually a decent compliment back in the day I have a side job at a recreation hall where i basically do this xB They have a projector that they use for slideshows and banners and im paid to set that up for them  minute job max i get paid  My grandma tells me I have the gift lol Just wait until the next generation when everyone the thinks youre old trying to figure out how the holograms work He built his own Nintendo Honey you should get an engineering job or something related with computers because you are so smart Anyone have the base image Me Plugging up color coded cords into color coded slots Everyone in my family Wow youre really good at that computer stuff I dont think I could do that They really needed to summon me from  miles away to set up a Dell computer A house of over a dozen people It seems that Im the only person in my family who is smart enough to plug a power cable into the spot on the wii that fits the power cable Just wait in like  years Ill be asking my son to quantum tether the Xbox  to the holo deck because my simple mind cant possibly comprehend the simple act of quantum entanglement Add on and the hdmi cable still has electricity in it It is like we were made for this Haha way too true Look Mum Just because I know how to use a Computer doesnt mean I know how to use the Sat Nav True Story My mom thinks I should work at Microsoft deleted

to download applications or anything on either her iPhone and smart TV Shes had an iPhone for about ten years now and Ive taught her countless times It drives me a bit insane really Im not sure how

was Facebook profile picture ready httpsimgurcomDwEau Wheres my  p wallpaper This has to be one of the most retarded images Ive seen My IQ just went  points lower from thinking how a libertarian would support NN Really shameful post Credit goes to umrbulldoppps The government can take my guns but god help them if they try to take my internet Oh wow this is perfect I just learned about the history of the flag this one is based off of from a YouTube channel called AlternateHistory i think thats the full name Its south parklike animation style The history of that flag fits perfectly Ironic since real libertarians dont support net neutrality Why are people talking about tea party and libertarians The original of this flag is older and in far wider use than that my name is snake im made of cord keep internet free so we can afford Ajit Pai he acts like snake but dont be fooled he is a fake is today opposite day or is OP just a retard Lol No matter if you like or dislike libertarians but most of the time the people that use the original dont tread on me flag are against government controlled net neutrality which makes this post even better drop frame is theft Can I please get this as like a bumper sticker Weird In my country supposedly we have net neutrality but my ISPs been throttling me for around  years now Cant change cos alternatives are even worse id buy this as a flag I made this for TechCrunchhttpstechcrunchcomthesearetheargumentsagainstnetneutralityandwhytheyrewrong Devin Coldewey came up with the concept I have to admit Dont Throttle Me is a good punchup No step on net Needs more JPEG Thy shant threadeth on me vile beggar Zag on em If its a subreddit about snakes wheres Ajit Pai I want this as a flag in my front yard rsneks This would make a great facebook cover photo if the text wasnt blocked in the bottom left  deleted We need shirts Theres only one ISP in my city everyone hates them Talk about a monolopy they have its annoying as hell Honestly this is a little ironic rSneks Hiss No Step on Net httpsiimgurcomcRyMjpg Credit uSprinkCal Gold for a repost No I dont care Not at all I dont care You care I dont care I dont care Reddit gold is meaningless yeah My new facebook picture WWW Strong Dont yeah on me I need a sticker made We dont block We dont throttle This doesnt make sense Libertarians want less government Repealing net neutrality is going to make less government regulation  I finally get this Title II doesnt prevent it Just saying This looks like a banner from Game of Thrones NN is the bandaid to the issue of little competition Also Im not sure many people here actually know what the gadsen flag means lol Ironic I dont think you understand how a few things work libertarianism government regulation or net neutrality Dont censor me No NN gives them the power to censor too So freaking worried about this Very sad we cant get half the effort from the Battlefront bullshit put into this This is so fucking real The irony here is lost on nearly the entire Reddit community  NO we have freedom FROM Government intervening in our lives not the other way around httpwwwdailywirecomnewsreasonsnetneutralityidioticaaronbandler deleted deleted I know its safe but this FILLS me with anxiety Killing me with the aquarium decorations Hold on while i text this to my wife Cuz now i have dreams of a freshwater aquarium inside of a pc I made youtube videos documenting the process so if you would like to learn more Ill link them here Part  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqKKPEMpntkts Part  httpsyoutubedtJjnp Nice how much does it weigh lol I love the look of mineral oil PCs but having that potential for a huge mess in my house would haunt me constantly Right on How are temps doing I cant wait until I have enough money where if I build one of these and screw it up I can eat the cost of the components I just ruined and the cleaning bill itll cause Needs better airflow   JK Looks really cool You can also use M Novec fluid but at  a bottle its a tad pricey See you in hot Unfortunately mineral oil has many issues namely that removing the parts will make them sticky no matter how much you clean The ideal cooling solution IMO is Ms Novec fluid but for some reason M has decided to not make it available to the general consumer and instead we have to pay out of the ass for it Using it we could probably usher in the golden age of tiny but powerful desktops since it would not even need a heat sink Unfortunate This gives me anxiety Noctua Master Race A fan attached to a heat sink Is that necessary Selling lightly used PC parts Hate to dissapoint you but I dont think youre covered by Apples waranty anymore with that computer Looks incredible but I feel like Id be in a state of constant panic having that sitting on my desk Do Robot Fish Dream in Computer Oil Aquariums That is awesome man Can someone explain this rblackmagicfuckery to my rOutOfTheLoop self One of the things I learned from mine years ago as I see youve noticed from yours is that the CPU gets a tad hot What helped for me is that I replaced the heatsink with a liquid cooling block and attached one end to a car cooling pump at the bottom and the other to a radiator outside the case which just dropped back into the case xB That being said mine was in an aquarium so I had much more space to deal with The one thing I really miss about that build was the GPU temps Man were those solid Does the oil hold well with time  Wow just wow That looks INSANE It looks like water swimming trough the case about to break every component D Vaccinate your PC mineral oil wont help anything Whats the front panel display If everything is submerged in mineral oil would it have a risk of being electrocuted or leakage And whats the differences if we dip everything in water instead of mineral oil What is it with everyone on this sub and amazing cable management Very slick build Looks great Have you done anything to the plastic bits to prevent them from breaking down Spray on clear coat Isnt that too much resistance on the fan making draw more current and overheat Ah another use for essential oils  HOW OP if you havent seen Novec cooling look that up Needs fish swimming around in it Winter Im about to ruin this whole mans carrer Must be a pain in the ass if a part breaks or you plan to upgrade For a second I thought evga said eve and those were tiny little avatars uVredditDownloader My only concern is that wouldnt the mineral oil become conductive over time as microscopic amounts of metal erode with the flow of the mineral oil I still dont get this wizardry So mineral oil is safe for electronic components I love this it looks so cool but these will never stop being terrifying to me This looks awesome And to each their own But if I ever manage to even own another PC again in my life itll be cooled by the tried and true air cooling method The purpose of the fans is to circulate the bubbles Deep Fried Motherboard whats the longevity on something like that This is a PC wet dream Mom pick me up Im scared I am both horrified and fascinated So all the components on the mobo are submerged Must have been built by a Jedi This is cool you should either  Anodize your wires using the water  Put a fish to swim around in it  Drink it pussy Do you have to replace all the mineral oil every few months or is it good forever Can somebody explain to me how this works Like are the parts protected How do they work like this That case was a timeless design As much as it pains me to give kudos to Apple This type of experimentation is forbidden citizen I strive to have this much trust how safe is this And does this shortens the mobo and other components life spwan  watt tf are you powering the nuclear missile base at the end of cod  Honestly I think the cut outs on the front and the aquarium decorations make it looks tacky and counteract the decision to use that case in particular However you clearly worked really hard on it cheers man To add to the fish tank aesthetic you should add some fake fish in the bottom Mineral oil cooled is so  The new hotness is Gamer Girl Bath Water cooled PCs  s Upgrading parts must suck Why is there still a fan on the cpu Have you tried essential oils though Is the heatsink necessary though Could you please issue some DIY instructions or maybe a resource on how to DIY you forgot to put My first build Is the CPU fan okay Looks cool but seems like a lot of mess and not worth the hassle I still dont understand how this is possible It looks like it would be extremely efficient at dropping temps though I hope one day I can build my own That looks so cool Oh yeah But can it Run Doom on Ultra I need an explanation on how this works deleted I would move that bubbler away from the CPU fan if I were you Its already working really hard moving oil around instead of air the bubbles going through it are going to seriously further diminish its life span I thought the mineral oils makes the components deteriorate faster i might be wrong thats insane good shit OP you should put some fish in there lol Wait theres still a cooler and fan on the cpu Wouldnt that extra stress kill the fan its acoyrwm in here boys This scares me i love the rocks and plants really cool touches  can you put my fish in it Specs THATS DOPE havent seen a setup like this before So how the hell do you ever upgrade the components in this PC Oooh okay thanks for the info Thats sick bro Wouldnt it be better to have a push  pull configuration for your heatsink  Or would this not help much Best of both worlds Put it in a tote or plexiglass box andor design an overflow tray beneath it that would funnel down into a similar reservoir larger than the case volume The dripleak overflow footprint basin tray would work for most things but being inside a larger box would protect from actual spraying horizontally or even in upward arcs from pinholes cracks broken edge seals etc You could also seal the entire thing in some rubberized spray or some such or rebuild it with just the guts in an actual impermeable container but either of those options would take away the cool viewable factor Incredible dude But can it float Crysis Wait that doesnt sound right You should Hackintosh it lol You should Hackintosh it lol howwhatisgoingon Karen wants to know your location Bruh you should put fish in there lol I love it Needs goldfish k upvotes  This will never get you to hot though Quick question do you have to change out the oil every so often Do you need to perform an oil change for your computer Thats bad ass man Now you just need a radiator for the mineral oil and itll be set Can some ELI just what the fuck is happening here Finally found a usage for an Apple product Yeah but why should have used pumpkin spice scented essential oil I feel like it needs a few small plastic fish that swim around in it Probably gonna be difficult to find some with the right amount of boyancy though WHERES THE CHEESE Is it possible to learn this power Go Broncos baby Put fish in there where are the fish  Need to replace fan blades with a propeller It aint much but its mine I love the bubbles Can someone explain to me how this is possible Is mineral oil just nonconductive or something needs some neutrally buoyant fake fish Im sorry What in the fuck I love it Due to the viscosity wouldnt you want a fan to at least be underneath the heat sink pushing oil through it and up to the surface if not a dual fan pushpull setup Ahh a PC for all Karens alike How Please tell me you hackintoshed this Also did you mod the case yourself Looks nice Absolute wow My mind was blown beyond cool how often do you have to change the mineral oil is it possible to seal it off and have it in a vacuum that way no contaminants can compromise the build I dont know how to make that I dont know if its effective at cooling I dont know how much risk it would pose to my components BUT I NEED IT Why do you still have a cpucooler with a fan Holy heck some of you people are waaaayyy too smart I feel like a knuckle dragger today Lol Nonconductive liquids I wouldimagine Is that panel for performancetemp read outs Beautiful Put a fish in it Whaaat Mineral Oil PCs are always awesome however I lack the patience the ever do repairs on those lol but can it run crysis Thats one unique Pc What kinda fish you gonna put in there uhm So how are you going to change computer part How much would Apple price that at Ha The most expensive part is the case How often do you have to filter the oil out What you did to that front face should be punishable by flogging Any fish in there Well done Its sick Great work OP God I love mineral cooled PCs Id love to do one but ya boy gotta pay for college  Next Step Add a fish What happens if you want to install something or have to get to the MOBO Right on I have the same gpu Super cool build Me an intellectual Mac Pro case wait thats illegal Gonna have to look into what tank you used Always wanted to do this but Ive read horror stories of the mineral oil eating away at most aquarium sealant and causing caps to budge something horrible Had always wanted to do either water cooling or mineral oil but it scares the fuck out of me Where are the fishes You should put a goldfish in there Is this how you wash your pc httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgXBJRzY Oh wow a enermax liquid cooler that does not suck Is the heat sink and fan actually doing anything If love to see a build like this with a cooler from an air con unit or fridge to keep the oil cold You could have a cold water loop running through the oil either Just why Looks fantastic props man Nice to see another one out in the wild would love to compare temps between our builds if youre interested beautiful Never thought Id give a computer an oil change Sorry to be the guy that says thats a powermac case not mac pro You should make it so you can keep some fish in there lol Thats beautiful and all but cleaning it out is gonna be quite the hassle Ok that is just so badass rvaporwaveaesthetics Why are you wasting your time with this pointless epeen extension bs Damn thats beautiful Should add some fish Question what was the wire gauge for the hxi Jesus Marie there minerals Excuse me wtf Anyone who has never had to remember all the mods you downloaded and the load order you put them in could never understand what a pain it was to redo the process This is me with Witcher  lmao Dont forget taking  hours curating your modlist and getting everything working only to play if for less than  hours Be wary travelers it is a path you might never come back from httpsiimgurcomAPzvUxjpg I just removed all mods for Fallout  and Skyrim and uninstalled both games last night Its time for me to move on as I dont play them at all anymore Hitman  no mods GB Replace it with Fallout  and thats me  Thats why I have a TB drive Cute KidhttpsiimgurcomTWlxcoDpng Best thing I ever did was buy an extra TB HDD to end the lack of space anxiety Ive installed every game there is even a small chance of me playing and still have plenty left Thomas in Skyrim You hear that my PC THOMAS HOW CAN I DELETE THAT Ill just leave this right here Seagate TB HDD Exos X  RPM eKn SATA Gbs MB Cache Inch Enterprise Hard Drive STNM httpswwwamazoncomdpBRQZJrefcmswrcpapiiqwLiDbVMQHQE Main drive SSD Backup Drive HDD Stick a Steam folder in the same spot on both and use the steam PropertiesLocal FilesMove Install Folder Only have to change one letter and hit move I do this with GB SSD and TB HDD with Optane Its actually one of the few times when having an Intel Optane drive on the HDD is good Copying from SSD to HDDOptane is nice and quick Also pay the few extra bucks and pickup the GB version of it if you do My shitbox has  TB spread out over  hard drives and a flash drive I get this issue all the time Maybe I pirate too much idk Fricking hell Ive just purged my entire partition with exactly GB of Skyrim I fell empty now i purchased  TB of SAS drives and an R to put them in I need more disks me almost filling my third tb drive Im crying in the basement rn Why HDD why not SSD I really need a larger than TB HDD for all my Steam games I know I have a problem and my  different game launchers mods texture packs etc Same with fucking Gmod OMG I just realized thats whats eating up my tb drive the ring is mine Sam And modded new vegas gig mx ssd Currently installed games  insurgency  skyrim special edition  heavily modded  cities skylines heavily modded  rimworld heavily modded  xcom  woc heavily modded  soon fo will be in here after buying it and modding the shit out of it Planned games migration when i get another ssd  witcher   gta   battletech  insurgency sandstorm  surviving mars heavily modded  stellaris heavily modded I definitely looking to get another ssd with prices going down tb ssd is definitely looking a good buy but im currently waiting for a good deal for a tb ssd instead of tb Isildurrrrrr I did not need this personal attack thank you very much Surely you buy a system that supports GB of RAM and run Skyrim from a RAM Disk I plopped in a  TB SSD in May I got  GB left I got  more SATA port on my MOBO though Im more likely to use it to copy some of my smaller drives  and  GB SSD onto bigger ones This is so relatable its scary I cant bring myself to do it either with nexus mbsec caps this would take approximately  hours to download again The same problem but with porn Assetto Corsa with mods This is me with my game libraries in general I have a downloaded game problem lol Guilty How much storage do you have in your PC I bought a gb Samsung Evo like  years or so ago Paid a small fortune and thought that it was overkill Boy was I wrong LOL Time to just upgrade to an ssd Sadly this is me I actually bought a new SSD because I didnt want to delete my Skyrim mods and was running around out of space  I feel this To be fair I do cast it into the fireonly to redownload a whole bunch of new mods and start the whole process again Every Skyrim playthrough starts with at least  hours of modding the game all over again do the hotswap bay thing that one guy did Me with Prime Day coming up lol Just get another ssd lol Literally me also count in the space for a clean backup Me with DCS I had to dedicate my SSD to Windows and DCS at some point Then that drive got full and I couldnt update DCS I had to buy a new SSD My DCS folder now sits at gb Did that with fallout  Quit after  mins Spent like  hours modding it So true I have fallout  with all the dlc and it takes gb unmodded Im gonna have to get a new drive because of it lol pls buy a SSD Not trying to ruin the joke but if you havent touched it in  years then there is no way its going to work with the mods anyway lol Took me  hours to get it all working to play  minutes and get bored No way in hell Im deleting it I just bought tb of hdds for precisely this reason Ive got almost a terabyte of games Ive only played Beat Saber for almost a year Wondering why the tag is mememacro How does macro have anything to do with meme Ha weakling The strong fill their gb hdd with mods plus the xwm converter with all the music converted to and from Skyrim a backup and offline setup incase of FUBAR or apocalyptic event high quality screenshots gigabytes worth of save games with different mod loadouts and characters and saved offline webpages from nexus for mods with complex instructions Haha omg I just thought yesterday maybe I should try Skyrim modding again but with actual gameplay I have probably  GB of mods on two drives  Me with GTA V Mods  Any good lore centric skyrim SE mod pack thats stable gb m ssds going for under  nowadays ISILIDOOOORL Too real Oblivion for me  Pretty sure I have k texture packs on my PC for fallout  new Vegas  Oblivion and Skyrim Thats alot of bytes Absolute epic gamer Right in the feels havent played skyrim in  yearsHOW This is me with years and years worth of shit games music photos It always comes down to fuck it Ill buy another drive The only problem is mounting them all My next one will have to replace another drive because Im all out of usable bays First Im upgrading to a new machine then getting a rack to begin the inklings of my media server This is me and my Oblivion install surprisingly big for an older game but the mods make up the large majority of it It was my big drive to get another HDD so I never have to do this D So many games from the steam library I doubled my drive space getting a TB M just so I can load more games onto it I like to think this is the correct way This was me until i finally cast the game and all mods in the pit of recycle  ive been so tempted to re install This is me with Gmod Ended up having  GB worth of addons Probably hasnt played it in  years cause it hasnt finished loading yet on an HDD enters Loverslab xB This is where the fun begins My gb of GTA V Ive never played because I downloaded it once when I activated it and just dont want that drama anymore Those who used Rockstar Launcher understand what I mean My  Go of utk maps mods mutators skins total conversions map packs More like the GB modded Skyrim i havent played in years is now ruined because of creation club and no longer works correctly gb of just Skyrim SE rars  another  for modded Skyrim se  Lately the mods have been going down quite a bit  So I download every decent looking mod I see and keep a tracking notification tied to it to make sure I have updates  This is me with Arma It took me a week to learn to mod and properly integrate said mods Ill buy another harddrive before I delete my ultra k HD DOA titty physics skyrim gb cod black ops  and gb gta V pirate with gb of modsother exttas for the game gb Cute Mr Anderson I literally had double the Fallout  file size in mods for it alone I dare not look at Skyrim Im considering buying a TB m drive would you guys say its worth it right now or will the prices drop further This actually made me chuckle well done D Actually lold Thanks good job ive literally been sitting here looking at skyrim mods then opened reddit to thislmao Any idea when the GoT Adaption Mod is coming out to public me I honestly cannot bring myself to play Skyrim after you kill the First Dragon That game was good in  Nowadays os unbearable One does not simply delete their old data i can relate on another platform Am I wierd I always start from scratch when prepparing to replay Skyrim and I always uninstall the whole mess as soon as I get bored I usually run  mods and rather than trying to update them or troubleshoot old incompatabilities I was too bored and lazy to fix I always like to start fresh I just re downloaded and am currently modding Skyrim again My steamgames folder became corrupted Im having a blast I was thinking about picking up a TB SSD Isildur knows whats up Laughs in  Tb hdd Laughs in devoting my life to tf and tf only Modded Minecraft also counts Sometimes the author deletes their mods off of nexus In that case you you now have rare mods lol Having that many mods addedremoved whilst still running stable is lucky enough I had to change the intro theme because I just associated it as the CTD music  I played Quake yesterday the  original Id figure a dedicated SSD would be the way to go especially with Skyrim i got like  gb left i got  extra drives but im too lazy to put them in and scared since im transferring my os onto an ssd TBF I got a TB HDD for about  You can get storage cheap so why the hell not get lots of it Fuck FUCK I had a single character with nearly  mods and over  hours put into it about  finished with Dawnguard Legit hated that DLC so much I stopped playing and deleted everything and now I miss it A mod set up from five years ago is so out of date you might as well throw it out I will spare this one Yup Im dealing with this rn except its about half my gb SSD D meirl This was red dead  after a week and a half Youre welcome in rDataHoarder anytime I once spent hours setting up a bunch of mods for skyrim Withing  minutes of playing g I remembered how much I didnt like that game Oh man dat feel I should delete it But if I ever play again ill have to redownload them all and refix the mod order holy shit this is literally me lmao U mean a new ssd  Its interesting how a  GB game has so much as can be modded to have even  times as much I do the exact opposite just flippantly deleting the entire folder its on steam Ill just download it again And I always regret that when I go to play again and spend a whole day modding it I have a NAS that I built with tb in it currently It was an old PC case built to hold like  hard drives back when that was cool This photo is more me than anything else on the internet TB SSDs frequently go for  or even less Why buy an HDD HDDs are cheap anyway How do I make it so I dont see these bullshit posts anymore Only GB Head over to rflightsim and ask someone the size of their PreparD or XPlane folder This is the quality content i am here for I have that problem but with Ark Hdd hahha Windirstathttpswindirstatnet is your best friend No issue here  gb baby of ram rdatahoarder This actually happened to me last week This exact scenario I mean not with the elves and shit but you get the idea I havent played Skyrim yet Is it worth it Sooo relatable Damn thats so true I think we should rate games on how long it takes till you delete it and your save data from your pc Right looks at writing on palm skoyrim was just Soo great  years later So uhhh my Petabyte server is full The thought of having to reinstall all those mods and get the save working again somehow is enough of a deterrent Man I really love this Its so damn true My Ark install is over GB not that many mods mostly just the DLCs Im specing out a dual TB M volume for games I have less than h of actual gameplay into that game  Haha gold I feel like playing some Skyrim because of this And then that deformed kid ran off with it on a flash drive and hid it in his basement for  years Is it slower than an internsl rpm to game on an external through usb c Same goes for minecraft until last week SSD buy more SSD SSD buy more ssds It took me years to delete my Skyrim and this was preSE I figured at this stage after over  hours Im unlikely to play again I did the same with Oblivion took me years to finally delete the mod directory and it was painful to do but the thought of having to update mods was worse than the thought of maybe having to start again Learn about us

computers most my life I just now realized its called a mouse because of the cord Thanks reddit handster No Heres the time table for the GTA V release dates Xbox   PS September   Xbox One  PS November    months from original release PC April    months from original release Assuming that Red Dead Redemption  follows a similar time table we get the following releases Xbox One  PS October   PC May  However given how close we are to a new console generation I wouldnt be surprised if RDR launches on the PS  Xbox Two  PC in Holiday  This is of course assuming that RDR comes to the PC at all Meanwhile Im just waiting for xbox ps emulators to have a constant stable  fps without visual bugs on RDR Read Dead Redemption You would think they would be eager to get into that largely untapped market for their game buuuut Rockstar conveniently enough updated their Social Club launcher and rebranded  it as Rockstar Games Launcher just a few minutes ago RDR PC announcement is imminent I can feel it Yep dont own any current gen consoles so Im just waiting I just wanna see what it looks like on a high end machine hell with my mid range even They had to tone down graphics for consoles Im sure At least we will soon have Halo games on steam Im almost tempted to not even fucking bother CockStar are such cunts with regard to their releases The only reason it doesnt get PC release early on is because they make more from people buying it twice I cant say I blame them but its still shitty anticonsumer practice And Then we are hit with Epic Games Store Its kinda funny that the platform that can run games the best always gets shitty ports axed features and delayed releases Youd think it would get some love I know its all about the money but yikes IDK if I want to support rockstar more after their mistreatment of gta online and the modding community Dont worry will get one after they make a next gen remaster  Dont worry Itll come Just a year after it gets rereleased on the new consoles They are doing the same thing that they did with GTAV waiting until online is fully monetized and the nextgen consoles are about to come out so they can sell the same game again on three new platforms Arent rockstar the developers  its not worth waiting for if they cant do simultaneous releases Im just waiting on RDRDR Have you got room for Single Player DLC in that last slide i just want gta  youre not missing out on much I mean if they dont want my money idk if its important to them What bothers me is that when it finally does come out on PC is will be full price for a game that is several years old They will do the same thing as they did with GTA V releasing it for current gen consoles then release it for next gen consoles and than for pc Its an okay game I personally got bored of it about  of the way through I like the guns and cars setting of GTA better I really be surprised if they release it on PC but not exclusively on Epic store At this point I have no interest I heard the game wasnt that amazing and a lot of it was just extended redundancy that got boring If RDR was on PC imagine the mods Dont forget youll be paying full price once it actually releases years later Yep that pisses me off Same happened with GTAV Feels straight up disrespectful but most people doesnt seem to agree with me I got gta but Im going to boycott Rockstar games in the future I would have bought RDR when it was released and when there was hype but now hype is gone and there behavior just feels disrespectful Ill take my business elsewhere like on cyberpunk Just move on and be excited for cyberpunk  perhaps the greatest game of all time By the time it releases on PC I will have forgotten about it There will be better things to play out by the time it is released on PC Every day they wait they lose potential customers Wtf are they thinking It will come eventually looking at the boatload of money rockstar made on gta V sales on pc it would be idiotic not to release such a game on pc This is a great format Yea at this point i probably wont pick it up when it does come out they should have capitalised on the hype but they fucked up hard Honestly with a wait this long Im not going to be excited when it does finally come out on PC and its not going to be a big deal for me to wait another year to buy it on sale if I buy it at all Its been out so long that it feels like Ive played it  times over already I sad they release it next year with a remaster for the new console generation Dw Pc has emulatora of old gameboy games that we cant play on ps pC mAsTeR rAcE I love this meme format Yes Rockstar bad I feel like they missed their window big time on this one The craze has died down and idk if Ill even get it now that  is on the way Im sure they make more staggering release but now theyve gotta be losing potential buyers just since the game is dating itself as we speak TBH I would be surprised if it comes to PC at this point They havent said anything about it they are most likely focusing everything they have on GTA VI Did they literally forget or wtf Red Dead  will come out ont nextgen consoles and THEN  months   year later we might have it on PC Exactly like GTA V Why Red dead is not worth at all lol they stopped caring long ago They delayed GTA for PC twice just to wring out more console sales epic exclusive incoming Im starting to lose hope I just wanna do cowboy shit on my pc  After playing a bit on PS I dont think Id buy anyway All the things that make a game a game to me arent there in rdr You know as funny as it is to put this on our collective wall for gamers and meme aficionados it accomplished nothing Social media is a thing like this subreddit and so are public relations Why dont we all copy this image Save it on your phone desktop etc and post it on Rockstars twitter page Do it every day until twitter blocks us or rockstar has a credible response Meh been so long now I wouldnt buy it anyways Yeah still havent played it one minute because Im waiting Can you imagine how beautiful this game could be on a beast of a gaming PC at K HDR Hz monitor heavy breathing Fuck em hopefully there are some good mod potential The game isnt really very replayable and i already beat it on console I will wait for all eternity before I buy a PS for The Last of Us or RDR I bought the game for the PS I thought it was overhyped but maybe its just my opinion Red dead one still doesnt have a steam plugin Its so annoying I dont even game much anymore latelytheres only  games I want right now off the top of my head for PC The spider man game and red dead redemption  Im not buying a console to get themI just wish theyd release them on PC Been playing RDR on my PS Im pretty underwhelmed so far Im still waiting on RDR to be good beyond story mode Youre not missing much honestly It got boring reaaaaaaal quick Meh Rockstars staggered launch just makes me lose hype by the time the pc version is released so I just wait a little longer until the game is at a deep discount Right Holy hell just ANYTHING ON THIS officially from them Not Yes we know theres a hole in our PC backlog shit WHY dont they want to do it Just fucking say anything What are the technical hurdles Are teams just instead on new IP The silence around Red Dead anything and PC is so fucking baffling and the shining example of how black box Rockstar is about anything and everything Im almost at the point where I WONT buy it because theyve lagged so hard At this point I question it ever coming out How did you misspell Red twice Honestly I dont think I even want it at this point Ill probably wait a few years and get it for  like I did with gta  and  Never played Read Dead Redemption  That okay cyber punk gonna take some time to beat Remember when EA said ps players would get  month early access to new things in battlefront  Yeah neither do they Dear Rockstar please hurry Im getting bored of Minecraft K thanks Rdr is prob my favorite open world game so glad I got and Xbox one x on the side Im waiting on GTA tyvm Playing cowboy doesnt do a thing for me Cowboys dont have fast cars boats helicopters and planes or jetpacks It wasnt forgotten They know that once they release it to PC the console game will die The console game is far more profitable than the PC game ever will be This is because the PC game will be modded to Hell and back thus becoming a better game that wont rely on the online money sink to add value for players They dont deserve our money Bought a ps just to play RDR At this point Im not even sure Id buy the game on PC I got it on Xbox but this stupid ass game they play with a huge delayed launch on PC is money grabbing at its best so fuck em Ill buy this in a heartbeat if they do release it Hopefully soon It probably will eventually come to PC because in GTAV online PC they added the treasure hunt for the revolver and the hatchet that both said youd get ingame rewards in RDR they wouldnt have added those to the PC version if Red dead wasnt eventually coming to PC They also forgot to make a fun game RDR is a great western movie But as a game the mechanics are outdated clunky slow and inconsistent Side missions dont appear on the big ass map until youre within spitting distance Cores for all your stats need maintained as well as your guns so that means you spend more time cooking and cleaning that actually being an outlaw Dont worry PC aint missing out on much template of the month for sure They also forgot Zombie mode Are there no plans to make a PC version  I played it for the first time this weekend and even just dumping some dude on the back of my horse then getting run over made me really want it I feel like Take Two are the ones pulling the strings regarding platforms where the game is going to release I sold my Xbox its more important now than ever Please Rockstar Please release it soon Im just waiting for some Single player DLC for GTA V Not really interested in RDR horsies Now imagine if that last panel was just a pile of cash though They better release it on PC with some kind of story DLC so I can buy it again I played it on PS fantastic game Meh I bought GTA V twice because I couldnt wait for a PC port After realizing how idiotic it is to buy the same game twice I learned to have some patience RDR will come to PC one day it just might be a while lol Rockstar will probably double dip on consoles with the new Xbox and PS for enhanced RDR ports Im willing to bet some pocket lint that PC will get that version just like GTA I never played the original RDR though Id be more interested in a legal remaster of that coming to PC in the meantime This is such a good meme format WHERE IS ITT dip dip double dip dip dip double dip Rockstar Read dead Did I read that right GTA v took a long ass time dont expect RDR to be any faster Got to wait for the next nerfbox to bankroll the Dev for the k upgrade This episode was literally just on last night This same meme but with single player dlc instead Is this where we are in life Making memes from  men This is the only thing chuck Lorre wrote that is worse than big bang theory Yeah read dead redemption my fav game Maybe they are tired of making so much money Maybe they ran out of enough places to put it all Not super interested in gta and red dead But the thought of playing cowboys with my friend makes me very happy Dont worry The game is really not that good Meh meennn Well they did make today their own launcher that basically confirms rdr on pc  Rockstar have released their own PC games launcher so perhaps a port isnt too far off One can only hope Lmao I just got it the other day ive already murdered  people I dont want to believe it but i wouldnt put it past R to wait until next gen consoles come out next xmas then rerelease on console and release on PC Hopefully it doesnt take that long but im trying to be realistic GTA V took over two years Wouldnt hold your breath Same shit happened with GTA V big deal wait a little bit It will come just like these memes every time R releases a game Trab pu kcip Well between GTA PS and PC was a year and a half distance RDR doesnt have a year if im not wrong lets just hope it will have close to the same period Id say it was worse that the game missed out compelling gameplay than it still not being ported to PC Hope it comes to PC so I can mod it to remove all the second long skinning cut scenes I still want RDR on PC Make a definitive edition with all DLC in one package Maybe even port it to the new RDR engine Precisely  Yes hope they wont pull a gta iv and badly optimize it Red dead is ass tho Dont worry youll all get to enjoy the end game farming sim like the rest of us I love read dead  They just launched the rockstar game launcher so maybe its coming soon why would I want to play a terrible game Meh Ill take if it ever comes out Id love R to make a solid May Payne game again instead personally Probably because we would not accept a fps locked game and I bet they designed it to run at fps lbh Rockstar hates that gtav got modded on PC and is huge on twitch  Mostly because it wasnt their idea and they didnt get to charge people for shark cards Wouldnt surprise me if they just gave the finger to PC cause there is no money to be made People still watch that show Capcom I literally cant play this on my Xbox I bought it but holy fuck the controls made me put it down Big yikes Yar Har Fiddle Dee Dee They know that once we get it were modding it Thats why they take so long because console peasants actually have to do what rockstar wants you to do After what they did with GTAO Im fine with not having it because I wouldnt play it Already played it on console having multiple platforms is the shit every goddamn time laughs in PS They are probably holding it back and twicking it more so that they can release it on next Gen consoles and pc Oh man I had forgotten about this game I did get GTA V on PC and played it for  hours maybe including all the waiting Screw RDR then Anyone who buys Red Dead Redemption  on PC if it ever comes out is the real Peasant Posted the same day as the launcher update of rockstar is OP a advertisers account or worse a alt of Gallow Boob  Is anyone else kind of okay with not playing it I played it on my buddys PS and it takes about  real life seconds to pick a flower ingame I just cant do it lol This I believe was on purpose If you play five finger fillet you will have an easier time pressing the buttons among other reasons Meme correction Panel  Should we port the game to PC Panel  No Cant wait for the PC community to fix and improve the game Rd is probably going to need a killer of to run Just buy it on console we dont want another gta v online loaded with cheaters and ddosers Well they released a launcher on PC so there might be a chance As much as I would like to play that game Im not buying an Xbox to do it Itll come out for PC first Im pretty positive Rockstar timed their release so that it could go alot like the PS  oneps  PC route where you had some people who bought it on all  platforms Im almost positive this is intentional buy a ps or wait  more years I just did a google check this morning to see if there was any news on a PC version I have a friend who works for Rockstar and he told me at the beginning of the year that end of the year well get something Im now doubtful I saw today its coming to PC December  I bought a Xbox one x just rdr it was worth
